Specifically, we used a corpus of over 26,000 fiction books to show that computational models of language trained on samples of language (i.e., subcorpora) representative of the language located in a particular place and time can track differences in people’s experimental language behavior. This conclusion was true across multiple tasks (lexical decision, category production, and word familiarity) and provided insight into the influence that language experience imposes on language processing and organization. We used the assembled corpus and methods to validate a new machine-learning approach for optimizing language models, entitled experiential optimization (Johns, Jones, & Mewhort in Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 26, 103–126, 2019).","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","lexic organ lexic semant distribut semant big data machin learn influenc place time lexic behavior distribut analysi measur document influenc corpus effect lexic behavior specif corpus fiction book show comput model languag train sampl languag subcorpora repres languag locat place time track differ peopl experiment languag behavior conclus true multipl task lexic decis categori product word familiar provid insight influenc languag experi impos languag process organ assembl corpus method valid machin learn approach optim languag model entitl experienti optim john jone mewhort psychonom bulletin review",0
"KeywordsCompound words Semantic transparency Psycholinguistics Morphology Bigram frequency Sentiment Family size ","ladec the large database of english compounds","The Large Database of English Compounds (LADEC) consists of over 8,000 English words that can be parsed into two constituents that are free morphemes, making it the largest existing database specifically for use in research on compound words. Both monomorphemic (e.g., wheel) and multimorphemic (e.g., teacher) constituents were used. The items were selected from a range of sources, including CELEX, the English Lexicon Project, the British Lexicon Project, the British National Corpus, and Wordnet, and were hand-coded as compounds (e.g., snowball). Participants rated each compound in terms of how predictable its meaning is from its parts, as well as the extent to which each constituent retains its meaning in the compound. In addition, we obtained linguistic characteristics that might influence compound processing (e.g., frequency, family size, and bigram frequency). To show the usefulness of the database in investigating compound processing, we conducted a number of analyses that showed that compound processing is consistently affected by semantic transparency, as well as by many of the other variables included in LADEC. We also showed that the effects of the variables associated with the two constituents are not symmetric. In short, LADEC provides the opportunity for researchers to investigate a number of questions about compounds that have not been possible to investigate in the past, due to the lack of sufficiently large and robust datasets. In addition to directly allowing researchers to test hypotheses using the information included in LADEC, the database will contribute to future compound research by allowing better stimulus selection and matching.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes","compound word semant transpar psycholinguist morpholog bigram frequenc sentiment famili size ladec larg databas english compound larg databas english compound ladec consist english word pars constitu free morphem make largest exist databas specif research compound word monomorphem wheel multimorphem teacher constitu item select rang sourc includ celex english lexicon project british lexicon project british nation corpus wordnet hand code compound snowbal particip rate compound term predict mean part extent constitu retain mean compound addit obtain linguist characterist influenc compound process frequenc famili size bigram frequenc show use databas investig compound process conduct number analys show compound process consist affect semant transpar variabl includ ladec show effect variabl constitu symmetr short ladec opportun research investig number question compound investig past due lack suffici larg robust dataset addit direct allow research test hypothes inform includ ladec databas contribut futur compound research allow stimulus select match",1
"KeywordsAge of acquisition Arousal Concreteness Dominance Familiarity Imageability Valence ","lexicosemantic affective and distributional norms for 1000 dutch adjectives","The research of the word is still very much the research of the noun. Adjectives have been largely overlooked, despite being the second-largest word class in many languages and serving an important communicative function, because of the rich, nuanced qualifications they afford. Adjectives are also ideally suited to study the interface between cognition and emotion, as they naturally cover the entire range of lexicosemantic variables such as imageability (infinite–green), and affective variables such as valence (sad–happy). We illustrate this by showing how the centrality of words in the mental lexicon varies as a function of the words’ affective dimensions, using newly collected norms for 1,000 Dutch adjectives. The norms include the lexicosemantic variables age of acquisition, familiarity, concreteness, and imageability; the affective variables valence, arousal, and dominance; and a variety of distributional variables, including network statistics resulting from a large-scale word association study. The norms are freely available from https://osf.io/nyg8v/, for researchers studying adjectives specifically or for whom adjectives constitute convenient stimuli to study other topics, such as vagueness, inference, spatial cognition, or affective word processing.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes","age acquisit arous concret domin familiar imag valenc lexicosemant affect distribut norm dutch adject research word research noun adject larg overlook largest word class languag serv import communic function rich nuanc qualif afford adject ideal suit studi interfac cognit emot natur cover entir rang lexicosemant variabl imag infinit green affect variabl valenc sad happi illustr show central word mental lexicon vari function word affect dimens newli collect norm dutch adject norm includ lexicosemant variabl age acquisit familiar concret imag affect variabl valenc arous domin varieti distribut variabl includ network statist result larg scale word associ studi norm freeli httpsosfionygv research studi adject specif adject constitut conveni stimuli studi topic vagu infer spatial cognit affect word process",1

However, the association norms produced by traditional free association tests tend not to exceed 10,000 stimulus words, making the number of associated words too small to be representative of the overall language. In this study we used text corpora totaling over 400 million Chinese words, along with a multitude of association measures, to automatically construct a Chinese Lexical Association Database (CLAD) comprising the lexical association of over 80,000 words. Comparison of the CLAD with a database of traditional Chinese word association norms shows that word associations extracted from large text corpora are similar in strength to those elicited from free association tests but contain a much greater number of associative word pairs. Additionally, the relatively small numbers of participants involved in the creation of traditional norms result in relatively coarse scales of association measurement, whereas the differentiation of association strengths is greatly enhanced in the CLAD. The CLAD provides researchers with a great supplement to traditional word association norms.

"KeywordsinfoVal Reverse correlation Classification images rcicr package R ","comment on quantifying the informational value of classification images a miscomputation of the infoval metric","Brinkman et al. (2019) recently introduced an innovative metric—infoVal—to assess the informational value of classification images (CIs) relative to a random distribution. Although this measure constitutes a valuable tool to distinguish random from nonrandom CIs, we identified two noteworthy discrepancies between the mathematical formalization of the infoVal metric and the authors’ computation. Specifically, the computation was based on the one norm instead of the Euclidean norm, and the k constant was omitted in the denominator of the ratio that produces infoVal. Accordingly, the simulations and experimental results reported by Brinkman et al. do not build on the correct infoVal computation but on a biased index. Importantly, this discrepancy in the computation affects the statistical power and Type I and error rate of the metric. Here we clarify the nature of the discrepancies in the computation and run Brinkman et al.’s Simulation 1 anew with the correct values, to illustrate their consequences. Overall, we found that relying on the miscomputed infoVal metric can lead to misguided conclusions, and we urge researchers to use the correct values.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","infov revers correl classif imag rcicr packag comment quantifi inform classif imag miscomput infov metric brinkman al recent introduc innov metric infov assess inform classif imag cis relat random distribut measur constitut valuabl tool distinguish random nonrandom cis identifi noteworthi discrep mathemat formal infov metric author comput specif comput base norm euclidean norm constant omit denomin ratio produc infov simul experiment result report brinkman al build correct infov comput bias index import discrep comput affect statist power type error rate metric clarifi natur discrep comput run brinkman al simul anew correct valu illustr consequ found reli miscomput infov metric lead misguid conclus urg research correct valu",0

Metrics were developed from data collected during an experiment in which racially diverse participants interacted with self-resembling avatars at social events hosted in the virtual world Second Life. In the qualitative stage, the researchers conceptualized four distinct patterns of movement from overhead video recreations of participants interacting during the social events. In the quantitative stage, these patterns of movement were operationalized into metrics to reflect each type of observed interpersonal behavior. The metrics were normalized through a series of transformations, and construct validity was assessed through correlations with self-report measures of intergroup behavior. Finally, the metrics were applied to an analysis of the virtual-world study examining the influence of resource competition on racial group interactions. The findings contribute to our understanding of the influence of resource competition on Blacks’, Asians’, and Whites’ group dynamics. Applications of these metrics for the future of the psychological study of interpersonal behavior are discussed.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","dynam spatiotempor data group dynam race mix method measur interperson interact continu spatiotempor data applic studi effect resourc competit racial group interact describ sequenti qualit quantit mix method procedur construct conceptu ground quantit metric interperson behavior continu spatiotempor data metric develop data collect experi racial divers particip interact resembl avatar social event host virtual world life qualit stage research conceptu distinct pattern movement overhead video recreat particip interact social event quantit stage pattern movement operation metric reflect type observ interperson behavior metric normal seri transform construct valid assess correl report measur intergroup behavior final metric appli analysi virtual world studi examin influenc resourc competit racial group interact find contribut understand influenc resourc competit black asian white group dynam applic metric futur psycholog studi interperson behavior discuss",0
"KeywordsDiscourse technology Readability Patient education Understanding ","a theoretically motivated method for automatically evaluating texts for gist inferences","We developed a method to automatically assess texts for features that help readers produce gist inferences. Following fuzzy-trace theory, we used a procedure in which participants recalled events under gist or verbatim instructions. Applying Coh-Metrix, we analyzed written responses in order to create gist inference scores (GISs), or seven variables converted to Z scores and averaged, which assess the potential for readers to form gist inferences from observable text characteristics. Coh-Metrix measures reflect referential cohesion and deep cohesion, which increase GIS because they facilitate coherent mental representations. Conversely, word concreteness, hypernymy for nouns and verbs (specificity), and imageability decrease GIS, because they promote verbatim representations. Also, the difference between abstract verb overlap among sentences (using latent semantic analysis) and more concrete verb overlap (using WordNet) should enhance coherent gist inferences, rather than verbatim memory for specific verbs. In the first study, gist condition responses scored nearly two standard deviations higher on GIS than did the verbatim condition responses. Predictions based on GIS were confirmed in two text analysis studies of 50 scientific journal article texts and 50 news articles and editorials. Texts from the Discussion sections of psychology journal articles scored significantly higher on GIS than did texts from the Method sections of the same journal articles. News reports also scored significantly lower than editorials on the same topics from the same news outlets. GIS proved better at discriminating among texts than did alternative formulae. In a behavioral experiment with closely matched text pairs, people randomly assigned to high-GIS versions scored significantly higher on knowledge and comprehension.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","discours technolog readabl patient educ understand theoret motiv method automat evalu text gist infer develop method automat assess text featur reader produc gist infer fuzzi trace theori procedur particip recal event gist verbatim instruct appli coh metrix analyz written respons order creat gist infer score giss variabl convert score averag assess potenti reader form gist infer observ text characterist coh metrix measur reflect referenti cohes deep cohes increas gis facilit coher mental represent convers word concret hypernymi noun verb specif imag decreas gis promot verbatim represent differ abstract verb overlap sentenc latent semant analysi concret verb overlap wordnet enhanc coher gist infer verbatim memori specif verb studi gist condit respons score standard deviat higher gis verbatim condit respons predict base gis confirm text analysi studi scientif journal articl text news articl editori text discuss section psycholog journal articl score signific higher gis text method section journal articl news report score signific lower editori topic news outlet gis prove discrimin text altern formula behavior experi close match text pair peopl random assign high gis version score signific higher knowledg comprehens",0
"KeywordsMechanical Turk Prime panels Online experimentation Data collection ","online panels in social science research expanding sampling methods beyond mechanical turk","Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is widely used by behavioral scientists to recruit research participants. MTurk offers advantages over traditional student subject pools, but it also has important limitations. In particular, the MTurk population is small and potentially overused, and some groups of interest to behavioral scientists are underrepresented and difficult to recruit. Here we examined whether online research panels can avoid these limitations. Specifically, we compared sample composition, data quality (measured by effect sizes, internal reliability, and attention checks), and the non-naivete of participants recruited from MTurk and Prime Panels—an aggregate of online research panels. Prime Panels participants were more diverse in age, family composition, religiosity, education, and political attitudes. Prime Panels participants also reported less exposure to classic protocols and produced larger effect sizes, but only after screening out several participants who failed a screening task. We conclude that online research panels offer a unique opportunity for research, yet one with some important trade-offs.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","mechan turk prime panel onlin experiment data collect onlin panel social scienc research expand sampl method mechan turk amazon mechan turk mturk wide behavior scientist recruit research particip mturk offer advantag tradit student subject pool import limit mturk popul small potenti overus group interest behavior scientist underrepres difficult recruit examin onlin research panel avoid limit specif compar sampl composit data qualiti measur effect size intern reliabl attent check naivet particip recruit mturk prime panel aggreg onlin research panel prime panel particip divers age famili composit religios educ polit attitud prime panel particip report exposur classic protocol produc larger effect size screen particip fail screen task conclud onlin research panel offer uniqu opportun research import trade off",0
"KeywordsResearch methods Deception Economics Psychology ","the importance of being honest evidence that deception may not pollute social science subject pools after all","Deceiving participants about the goals or content of a study is permitted in psychological research but is largely banned in economics journals and subject pools. This ban is intended to protect a public good: If experiencing deception causes participants to be suspicious in future studies, and suspicion meaningfully influences their behavior, then the entire field suffers. We report a survey of psychologists’ and economists’ attitudes toward deception (N = 568) and a large, nondeceptive multisite study in which we measured participants’ histories, suspicion levels, and behavior in four common economic tasks (N = 636). Economists reported more negative attitudes toward deceptive methods and greater support for the deception ban than did psychologists. The results of the behavioral study, however, do not support the “public good” argument for banning deception about the goals or content of a research study: Participants’ present suspicion was not clearly related to past experiences of deception, and there were no consistent behavioral differences between suspicious and credulous participants. We discuss the implications of these results for the ongoing debate regarding the acceptability of deceptive research methods.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","research method decept econom psycholog import honest evid decept pollut social scienc subject pool deceiv particip goal content studi permit psycholog research larg ban econom journal subject pool ban intend protect public good experienc decept particip suspici futur studi suspicion meaning influenc behavior entir field suffer report survey psychologist economist attitud decept larg nondecept multisit studi measur particip histori suspicion level behavior common econom task economist report negat attitud decept method greater support decept ban psychologist result behavior studi support public good argument ban decept goal content research studi particip present suspicion relat past experi decept consist behavior differ suspici credul particip discuss implic result ongo debat accept decept research method",0

Listeners rated two voice samples (short sentences) per speaker for attractiveness, likeability, two measures of distinctiveness (“deviation”-based [DEV] and “voice in the crowd”-based [VITC]), regional accent, and age. Interrater reliability was high, with Cronbach’s α between .82 and .99. Young voices were generally rated as more attractive than old voices, but particularly so when male listeners judged female voices. Moreover, young female voices were rated as more likeable than both young male and old female voices. Young voices were judged to be less distinctive than old voices according to the DEV measure, with no differences in the VITC measure. In age ratings, listeners almost perfectly discriminated young from old voices; additionally, young female voices were perceived as being younger than young male voices. Correlations between the rating dimensions above demonstrated (among other things) that DEV-based distinctiveness was strongly negatively correlated with rated attractiveness and likeability. By contrast, VITC-based distinctiveness was uncorrelated with rated attractiveness and likeability in young voices, although a moderate negative correlation was observed for old voices. Overall, the present results demonstrate systematic effects of vocal age and gender on impressions based on the voice and inform as to the selection of suitable voice stimuli for further research into voice perception, learning, and memory.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes","vocal age impress person voic space voic databas speech corpus jena speaker set jessa databas voic stimuli unfamiliar young adult speaker describ jena speaker set jess free databas unfamiliar adult voic stimuli compris voic young year year femal male speaker utter sentenc syllabl read text semi spontan speech vowel listen rate voic sampl short sentenc speaker attract likeabl measur distinct deviat base dev voic crowd base vitc region accent age interrat reliabl high cronbach young voic general rate attract voic male listen judg femal voic young femal voic rate likeabl young male femal voic young voic judg distinct voic dev measur differ vitc measur age rate listen perfect discrimin young voic addit young femal voic perceiv younger young male voic correl rate dimens demonstr thing dev base distinct strong negat correl rate attract likeabl contrast vitc base distinct uncorrel rate attract likeabl young voic moder negat correl observ voic present result demonstr systemat effect vocal age gender impress base voic inform select suitabl voic stimuli research voic percept learn memori",1

For each text, rich metadata is available, including age, grade and linguistic background (at least 60% of the children were multilingual). To our knowledge, our corpus is the largest longitudinal corpus of written texts by children at primary school age. Each word is included in its original spelling as well as in a normalized form (target hypothesis), specifying the intended word form, which we corrected for orthographic but not grammatical errors. Original and target word forms are aligned character-wise and the target word forms are enriched with phonological, syllabic, and morphological information. Additionally, for each target word form, we established key lexical variables, e.g., word frequency or summed bigram frequency, as specified in childLex. Where applicable, we also specify key features of German orthography (e.g., consonant doubling, vowel-lengthening <h>). Taken together, this information allows for a detailed assessment of the properties of words that tend to increase the likelihood of spelling errors.

This approach provides a practical solution for rapidly approximating probability densities with high precision. In addition to demonstrating this method, we fit a piecewise linear ballistic accumulator model (Holmes, Trueblood, & Heathcote, 2016) to empirical data.

"KeywordsMorphology Psycholinguistic variables Lexical decision Database Visual word recognition French ","morpholex fr a derivational morphological database for 38840 french words","Studies on morphological processing in French, as in other languages, have shown disparate results. We argue that a critical and long-overlooked factor that could underlie these diverging results is the methodological differences in the calculation of morphological variables across studies. To address the need for a common morphological database, we present MorphoLex-FR, a sizeable and freely available database with 12 variables for prefixes, roots, and suffixes for the 38,840 words of the French Lexicon Project. MorphoLex-FR constitutes a first step to render future studies addressing morphological processing in French comparable. The procedure we used for morphological segmentation and variable computation is effectively the same as that in MorphoLex, an English morphological database. This will allow for cross-linguistic comparisons of future studies in French and English that will contribute to our understanding of how morphologically complex words are processed. To validate these variables, we explored their influence on lexical decision latencies for morphologically complex nouns in a series of hierarchical regression models. The results indicated that only morphological variables related to the suffix explained lexical decision latencies. The frequency and family size of the suffix exerted facilitatory effects, whereas the percentage of more frequent words in the morphological family of the suffix was inhibitory. Our results are in line with previous studies conducted in French and in English. In conclusion, this database represents a valuable resource for studies on the effect of morphology in visual word processing in French.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes","morpholog psycholinguist variabl lexic decis databas visual word recognit french morpholex fr deriv morpholog databas french word studi morpholog process french languag shown dispar result argu critic long overlook factor underli diverg result methodolog differ calcul morpholog variabl studi address common morpholog databas present morpholex fr sizeabl freeli databas variabl prefix root suffix word french lexicon project morpholex fr constitut step render futur studi address morpholog process french compar procedur morpholog segment variabl comput effect morpholex english morpholog databas cross linguist comparison futur studi french english contribut understand morpholog complex word process valid variabl explor influenc lexic decis latenc morpholog complex noun seri hierarch regress model result morpholog variabl relat suffix explain lexic decis latenc frequenc famili size suffix exert facilitatori effect percentag frequent word morpholog famili suffix inhibitori result line previous studi conduct french english conclus databas repres valuabl resourc studi effect morpholog visual word process french",1
"KeywordsMotion tracking Video recording Deep learning Gesture and speech analysis Multimodal language ","the quantification of gesturespeech synchrony a tutorial and validation of multimodal data acquisition using device based and video based motion tracking","There is increasing evidence that hand gestures and speech synchronize their activity on multiple dimensions and timescales. For example, gesture’s kinematic peaks (e.g., maximum speed) are coupled with prosodic markers in speech. Such coupling operates on very short timescales at the level of syllables (200 ms), and therefore requires high-resolution measurement of gesture kinematics and speech acoustics. High-resolution speech analysis is common for gesture studies, given that field’s classic ties with (psycho)linguistics. However, the field has lagged behind in the objective study of gesture kinematics (e.g., as compared to research on instrumental action). Often kinematic peaks in gesture are measured by eye, where a “moment of maximum effort” is determined by several raters. In the present article, we provide a tutorial on more efficient methods to quantify the temporal properties of gesture kinematics, in which we focus on common challenges and possible solutions that come with the complexities of studying multimodal language.

"KeywordsParaphrase identification Named-entity semantic relatedness WordNet Wikipedia Word category subsumption ","a hybrid approach for paraphrase identification based on knowledge enriched semantic heuristics","In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for sentence paraphrase identification. The proposal addresses the problem of evaluating sentence-to-sentence semantic similarity when the sentences contain a set of named-entities. The essence of the proposal is to distinguish the computation of the semantic similarity of named-entity tokens from the rest of the sentence text. More specifically, this is based on the integration of word semantic similarity derived from WordNet taxonomic relations, and named-entity semantic relatedness inferred from Wikipedia entity co-occurrences and underpinned by Normalized Google Distance. In addition, the WordNet similarity measure is enriched with word part-of-speech (PoS) conversion aided with a Categorial Variation database (CatVar), which enhances the lexico-semantics of words. We validated our hybrid approach using two different datasets; Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC) and TREC-9 Question Variants. In our empirical evaluation, we showed that our system outperforms baselines and most of the related state-of-the-art systems for paraphrase detection. We also conducted a misidentification analysis to disclose the primary sources of our system errors.

"KeywordsArabic language Arabic language resources Arabic NLP Semtic morphology Root-and-pattern model Pattern-and-root model Finite state transducers Local grammars Compression algorithm Vocalisation Vowelization ","restoring arabic vowels through omission tolerant dictionary lookup","Vowels in Arabic are optional orthographic symbols written as diacritics above or below letters. In Arabic texts, typically more than 97 percent of written words do not explicitly show any of the vowels they contain; that is to say, depending on the author, genre and field, less than 3 percent of words include any explicit vowel. Although numerous studies have been published on the issue of restoring the omitted vowels in speech technologies, little attention has been given to this problem in papers dedicated to written Arabic technologies. In this research, we present Arabic-Unitex, an Arabic Language Resource, with emphasis on vowel representation and encoding. Specifically, we present two dozens of rules formalizing a detailed description of vowel omission in written text. They are typographical rules integrated into large-coverage resources for morphological annotation. For restoring vowels, our resources are capable of identifying words in which the vowels are not shown, as well as words in which the vowels are partially or fully included. By taking into account these rules, our resources are able to compute and restore for each word form a list of compatible fully vowelized candidates through omission-tolerant dictionary lookup. In our previous studies, we have proposed a straightforward encoding of taxonomy for verbs (Neme in Proceedings of the international workshop on lexical resources (WoLeR) at ESSLLI, 2011) and broken plurals (Neme and Laporte in Lang Sci, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.langsci.2013.06.002). While traditional morphology is based on derivational rules, our description is based on inflectional ones. The breakthrough lies in the reversal of the traditional root-and-pattern Semitic model into pattern-and-root, giving precedence to patterns over roots. The lexicon is built and updated manually and contains 76,000 fully vowelized lemmas. It is then inflected by means of finite-state transducers (FSTs), generating 6 million forms. The coverage of these inflected forms is extended by formalized grammars, which accurately describe agglutinations around a core verb, noun, adjective or preposition. A laptop needs one minute to generate the 6 million inflected forms in a 340-MB flat file, which is compressed in 2 min into 11 MB for fast retrieval. Our program performs the analysis of 5000 words/second for running text (20 pages/second). Based on these comprehensive linguistic resources, we created a spell checker that detects any invalid/misplaced vowel in a fully or partially vowelized form. Finally, our resources provide a lexical coverage of more than 99 percent of the words used in popular newspapers, and restore vowels in words (out of context) simply and efficiently.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"Yes","arab languag arab languag resourc arab nlp semtic morpholog root pattern model pattern root model finit state transduc local grammar compress algorithm vocalis vowel restor arab vowel omiss toler dictionari lookup vowel arab option orthograph symbol written diacrit letter arab text typic percent written word explicit show vowel depend author genr field percent word includ explicit vowel numer studi publish issu restor omit vowel speech technolog attent problem paper dedic written arab technolog research present arab unitex arab languag resourc emphasi vowel represent encod specif present dozen rule formal detail descript vowel omiss written text typograph rule integr larg coverag resourc morpholog annot restor vowel resourc capabl identifi word vowel shown word vowel partial fulli includ take account rule resourc comput restor word form list compat fulli vowel candid omiss toler dictionari lookup previous studi propos straightforward encod taxonomi verb neme proceed intern workshop lexic resourc woler esslli broken plural neme laport lang sci httpdxdoiorglangsci tradit morpholog base deriv rule descript base inflect breakthrough lie revers tradit root pattern semit model pattern root give preced pattern root lexicon built updat manual fulli vowel lemma inflect mean finit state transduc fsts generat million form coverag inflect form extend formal grammar accur describ agglutin core verb noun adject preposit laptop minut generat million inflect form mb flat file compress min mb fast retriev program perform analysi word run text page base comprehens linguist resourc creat spell checker detect invalidmisplac vowel fulli partial vowel form final resourc provid lexic coverag percent word popular newspap restor vowel word context simpli effici",1

 That is to say, a particular specialist term may be associated with many other concepts, including quotations, different senses, etymological categories, semantic categories, superordinate and subordinate terms in the terminological hierarchy, spelling variants, and references to background sources discussing the exact meaning and application of the term. The various concepts,
 in turn, form networks of mutual links, which makes the structure of the background concepts demanding to model when designing a database structure for this type of dictionary.

The process started with an analysis of hand-written manuscripts and early printed books from different sources and ended with the electronic dictionary described in the present paper. Over these years, the conceptual structure, database schema, and requirements for essential use cases were iteratively developed. In our paper, we introduce the conceptual structure and database schema modelled for implementing an electronic dictionary that involves different use cases such as term insertion and linking a term to related concepts.

A variety of Berkeley FrameNet examples were chosen from different frames and then translated by professionals. The FinnFrameNet annotation team checked all the examples and their translations to see if the frames remained intact in translation. Problematic examples were tagged according to the type of the encountered problem, with the main focus on the type of fine-grained mismatches of meaning that caused frame changes even when the translation was the best possible one. The frame-loss amounted to 4.2% of the 88,209 relevant example sentences.

"KeywordsLiterature Literariness Document embeddings Topic models ","vector space explorations of literary language","Literary novels are said to distinguish themselves from other novels through conventions associated with literariness. We investigate the task of predicting the literariness of novels as perceived by readers, based on a large reader survey of contemporary Dutch novels. Previous research showed that ratings of literariness are predictable from texts to a substantial extent using machine learning, suggesting that it may be possible to explain the consensus among readers on which novels are literary as a consensus on the kind of writing style that characterizes literature. Although we have not yet collected human judgments to establish the influence of writing style directly (we use a survey with judgments based on the titles of novels), we can try to analyze the behavior of machine learning models on particular text fragments as a proxy for human judgments. In order to explore aspects of the texts associated with literariness, we divide the texts of the novels in chunks of 2–3 pages and create vector space representations using topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and neural document embeddings (Distributed Bag-of-Words Paragraph Vectors). We analyze the semantic complexity of the novels using distance measures, supporting the notion that literariness can be partly explained as a deviation from the norm. Furthermore, we build predictive models and identify specific keywords and stylistic markers related to literariness. While genre plays a role, we find that the greater part of factors affecting judgments of literariness are explicable in bag-of-words terms,
 even in short text fragments and among novels with higher literary ratings.

The general idea is to learn a model on the (better-resourced) source language, which will then be applied to the (regional) target language. Delexicalization is used to deal with the difference in vocabulary, by creating abstract representations of the data.

Aromo is a unit selection text-to-speech system, which employs diphones as units of synthesis. The key requirements and design criteria for Emilia were: to synthesize any text in Spanish into high-quality speech with a minimum corpus size. The text corpus was designed to guarantee the phonetic and prosodic coverage. A three-stage strategy was used: in the first stage, 741 sentences were designed with all of the syllables of Spanish spoken in Argentina, with and without stress, and in all positions within the word; in the second stage, 852 sentences were added to balance out the distribution of the diphones; and after a perceptual evaluation of the quality of synthesized speech, in the third and final stage, 625 sentences were added to achieve the specified unit coverage, and to introduce sentences with more complex syntactic and prosodic structures. Issues from all three corpus building stages are reported. The paper also presents the results from the quality perceptual evaluations of the synthesized voice.

"KeywordsWord sense disambiguation Lexical sample task Sense tagged Urdu corpus ","a word sense disambiguation corpus for urdu","The aim of word sense disambiguation (WSD) is to correctly identify the meaning of a word in context. All natural languages exhibit word sense ambiguities and these are often hard to resolve automatically. Consequently WSD is considered an important problem in natural language processing (NLP). Standard evaluation resources are needed to develop, evaluate and compare WSD methods. A range of initiatives have lead to the development of benchmark WSD corpora for a wide range of languages from various language families. However, there is a lack of benchmark WSD corpora for South Asian languages including Urdu, despite there being over 300 million Urdu speakers and a large amounts of Urdu digital text available online. To address that gap, this study describes a novel benchmark corpus for the Urdu Lexical Sample WSD task. This corpus contains 50 target words (30 nouns, 11 adjectives, and 9 verbs). A standard, manually crafted dictionary called Urdu Lughat is used as a sense inventory. Four baseline WSD approaches were applied to the corpus. The results show that the best performance was obtained using a simple Bag of Words approach. To encourage NLP research on the Urdu language the corpus is freely available to the research community.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"Yes","word sens disambigu lexic sampl task sens tag urdu corpus word sens disambigu corpus urdu aim word sens disambigu wsd correct identifi mean word context natur languag exhibit word sens ambigu hard resolv automat wsd consid import problem natur languag process nlp standard evalu resourc need develop evalu compar wsd method rang initi lead develop benchmark wsd corpora wide rang languag languag famili lack benchmark wsd corpora south asian languag includ urdu million urdu speaker larg amount urdu digit text onlin address gap studi describ benchmark corpus urdu lexic sampl wsd task corpus target word noun adject verb standard manual craft dictionari call urdu lughat sens inventori baselin wsd approach appli corpus result show perform obtain simpl bag word approach encourag nlp research urdu languag corpus freeli research communiti",1
"KeywordsParallel corpus Arabizi Algerian dialects Code-switching Text categorization Machine translation ","dzdc12 a new multipurpose parallel algerian arabizifrench code switched corpus","Algeria’s socio-linguistic situation is known as a complex phenomenon involving several historical, cultural and technological factors. However, there are three languages that are mainly spoken in Algeria (Arabic, Tamazight and French) and they can be mixed in the same sentence (code-switching). Moreover, there are several varieties of dialects that differ from one region to another and sometimes within the same region. This paper aims to provide a new multi-purpose parallel corpus (i.e., DZDC12 corpus), which will serve as a testbed for various natural language processing and information retrieval applications. In particular, it can be a useful tool to study Arabic–French code-switching phenomenon, Algerian Romanized Arabic (Arabizi), different Algerian sub-dialects, sentiment analysis, gender writing style, machine translation, abuse detection, etc. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed corpus is the first of its kind, where the texts are written in Latin script and crawled from Facebook. More specifically, this corpus is organised by gender, region and city, and is transliterated into Arabic script and translated into Modern Standard Arabic. In addition, it is annotated for emotion detection and abuse detection, and annotated at the word level. This article focuses in particular on Algeria’s socio-linguistic situation and the effect of social media networks. Furthermore, the general guidelines for the design of DZDC12 corpus are described as well as the dialects clustering over the map.

 As Italian is under-represented in speech emotion research, for a comparison with the state-of-the-art, we model the ‘big 6 emotions’ and guilt. Besides making available this database for research, our contribution is three-fold: First, we employ a variety of mood induction procedures, whose combinations are especially tailored for specific emotions.
 Second, we use combinations of selection procedures such as an alexithymia test and self- and external assessment, obtaining 1,5 k (proto-) typical samples; these were used in a perception test (86 native Italian subjects, categorical identification and dimensional rating). Third, machine learning techniques—based on standardised brute-forced openSMILE ComParE features and support vector machine classifiers—were applied to assess how emotional typicality and sample size might impact machine learning efficiency.
 Our results are three-fold as well: First, we show that appropriate induction techniques ensure the collection of valid samples, whereas the type of self-assessment employed turned out not to be a meaningful measurement. Second, emotional typicality—which shows up in an acoustic analysis of prosodic main features—in contrast to sample size is not an essential feature for successfully training machine learning models. Third, the perceptual findings demonstrate that the confusion patterns mostly relate to cultural rules and to ambiguous emotions.

However, the few sense-annotated corpora of textual definitions available to date are of limited size: this is mainly due to the expensive and time-consuming process of annotating a wide variety of word senses and entity mentions at a reasonably high scale. In this paper we present SenseDefs, a large-scale high-quality corpus of disambiguated definitions (or glosses) in multiple languages, comprising sense annotations of both concepts and named entities from a wide-coverage unified sense inventory. Our approach for the construction and disambiguation of this corpus builds upon the structure of a large multilingual semantic network and a state-of-the-art disambiguation system: first, we gather complementary information of equivalent definitions across different languages to provide context for disambiguation; then we refine the disambiguation output with a distributional approach based on semantic similarity. As a result, we obtain a multilingual corpus of textual definitions featuring over 38 million definitions in 263 languages, and we publicly release it to the research community.

"KeywordsDiscourse markers Detection/correction of errors Writing support tool Academic writing Native language interference ","automatic detection and correction of discourse marker errors made by spanish native speakers in portuguese academic writing","Discourse markers are words and expressions (such as: firstly, then, for example, because, as a result, likewise, in comparison, in contrast) that explicitly state the relational structure of the information in the text, i.e. signalling a sequential relationship between the current message and the previous discourse. Using these markers improves the cohesion and coherence of texts, facilitating reading comprehension. Although often included in tools that support the rhetoric structuring of texts, discourse markers have hardly been explored in writing support tools for learners of a second language. However, learners of a second language, including those at advanced levels, have trouble producing these lexical items, frequently replacing them with items from their native language or with literal translations of items in their own language, which often do not result in proper lexical items in the second language. In addition, students learn a single marker per function and use it repeatedly, producing monotonous texts. With the aim of contributing to reducing these difficulties, this paper presents a lexicon that will be used to support the task of automatically detecting and correcting discourse marker errors. Several heuristics have been evaluated to generate different types of errors. Automatic translation methods were used to semi-automatically compile the lexicon used in these heuristics. Similarity measures were also combined with these heuristics to correct discourse marker errors. The evaluated methods proved to be suitable for the task of identifying some types of discourse marker errors and can potentially identify many others, as long as new lexical inputs are incorporated into them.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"No","discours marker detectioncorrect error write support tool academ write nativ languag interfer automat detect correct discours marker error made spanish nativ speaker portugues academ write discours marker word express first result likewis comparison contrast explicit state relat structur inform text signal sequenti relationship current messag previous discours marker improv cohes coher text facilit read comprehens includ tool support rhetor structur text discours marker explor write support tool learner languag learner languag includ advanc level troubl produc lexic item frequent replac item nativ languag liter translat item languag result proper lexic item languag addit student learn singl marker function repeat produc monoton text aim contribut reduc difficulti paper present lexicon support task automat detect correct discours marker error heurist evalu generat type error automat translat method semi automat compil lexicon heurist similar measur combin heurist correct discours marker error evalu method prove suitabl task identifi type discours marker error potenti identifi long lexic input incorpor",0

"KeywordsDigital humanities Adaptation of NLP tool chains Interdisciplinary working practice ","computational text analysis within the humanities how to combine working practices from the contributing fields","This position paper is based on a keynote presentation at the COLING 2016 Workshop on Language Technology for Digital Humanities in Osaka, Japan. It departs from observations about working practices in Humanities disciplines following a hermeneutic tradition of text interpretation versus the method-oriented research strategies in Computational Linguistics (CL). The respective praxeological traditions are quite different. Yet more and more researchers are willing to open up towards truly transdisciplinary collaborations, trying to exploit advanced methods from CL within research that ultimately addresses questions from the traditional Humanities disciplines and the Social Sciences. The article identifies two central workflow-related issues for this type of collaborative project in the Digital Humanities (DH) and Computational Social Science: (1) a scheduling dilemma, which affects the point in the course of the project when specifications of the core analysis task are fixed (as early as possible from the computational perspective, but as late as possible from the Humanities perspective) and (2) the subjectivity problem, which concerns the degree of intersubjective stability of the target categories of analysis. CL methodology demands high inter-annotator agreement and theory-independent categories, while the categories in hermeneutic reasoning are often tied to a particular interpretive approach (viz. a theory of literary interpretation) and may bear a non-trivial relation to a reader’s pre-understanding. Building a comprehensive methodological framework that helps overcome these issues requires considerable time and patience. The established computational methodology has to be gradually opened up to more hermeneutically oriented research questions; resources and tools for the relevant categories of analysis have to be constructed. This article does not call into question that well-targeted efforts along this path are worthwhile. Yet, it makes the following additional programmatic point regarding directions for future research: It might be fruitful to explore—in parallel—the potential lying in DH-specific variants of the concept of rapid prototyping from Software Engineering. To get an idea of how computational analysis of some aspect of text might contribute to a hermeneutic research question, a prototypical analysis model is constructed, e.g., from related data collections and analysis categories, using transfer techniques. While the initial quality of analysis may be limited, the idea of rapid probing allows scholars to explore how the analysis fits in an actual workflow on the target text data and it can thus provide early feedback for the process of refining the modeling. If the rapid probing method can indeed be incorporated in a hermeneutic framework to the satisfaction of well-disposed Humanities scholars, a swifter exploration of alternative paths of analysis would become possible. This may generate considerable additional momentum for transdisciplinary integration. It is as yet too early to point to truly Humanities-oriented examples of the proposed rapid probing technique. To nevertheless make the programmatic idea more concrete, the article uses two experimental scenarios to argue how rapid probing might help addressing the scheduling dilemma and the subjectivity problem respectively.

Hence, cross-disciplinary teams would greatly benefit from using a language technology-based tool that allows for the (at least semi-) automated resolution of ambiguous terms. Although no such tool is readily available, an interesting theoretical outline of one does exist. The main obstacle for the concrete realization of this tool is the current lack of an effective method for the automatic detection of the different meanings of ambiguous terms across different disciplinary jargons. In this paper, we set up a pilot study to experimentally assess whether the word sense induction technique of ‘context clustering’, as implemented in the software package ‘SenseClusters’, might be a solution. More specifically, given several sets of sentences coming from a cross-disciplinary corpus containing a specific ambiguous term, we verify whether this technique can classify each sentence in accordance to the meaning of the ambiguous term in that sentence. For the experiments, we first compile a corpus that represents the disciplinary jargons involved in a project on Bone Tissue Engineering. Next, we conduct two series of experiments. The first series focuses on determining appropriate SenseClusters parameter settings using manually selected test data for the ambiguous target terms ‘matrix’ and ‘model’. The second series evaluates the actual performance of SenseClusters using randomly selected test data for an extended set of target terms. We observe that SenseClusters can successfully classify sentences from a cross-disciplinary corpus according to the meaning of the ambiguous term they contain. Hence, we argue that this implementation of context clustering shows potential as a method for the automatic detection of the meanings of ambiguous terms in cross-disciplinary communication.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"No","cross disciplinari communic disambigu word sens induct senseclust terminolog ambigu approach terminolog ambigu cross disciplinari communic word sens induct task pilot studi cross disciplinari communic imped terminolog ambigu cross disciplinari team great benefit languag technolog base tool semi autom resolut ambigu term tool readili interest theoret outlin exist main obstacl concret realiz tool current lack effect method automat detect mean ambigu term disciplinari jargon paper set pilot studi experiment assess word sens induct techniqu context cluster implement softwar packag senseclust solut specif set sentenc come cross disciplinari corpus specif ambigu term verifi techniqu classifi sentenc accord mean ambigu term sentenc experi compil corpus repres disciplinari jargon involv project bone tissu engin conduct seri experi seri focus determin senseclust paramet set manual select test data ambigu target term matrix model seri evalu actual perform senseclust random select test data extend set target term observ senseclust success classifi sentenc cross disciplinari corpus mean ambigu term argu implement context cluster show potenti method automat detect mean ambigu term cross disciplinari communic",0
"KeywordsIntrinsic plagiarism detection Character n-grams Stylistic features Writing style analysis ","on the use of character n grams as the only intrinsic evidence of plagiarism","When a shift in writing style is noticed in a document, doubts arise about its originality. Based on this clue to plagiarism, the intrinsic approach to plagiarism detection identifies the stolen passages by analysing the writing style of the suspicious document without comparing it to textual resources that may serve as sources for the plagiarist. Character n-grams are recognised as a successful approach to modelling text for writing style analysis. Although prior studies have investigated the best practice of using character n-grams in authorship attribution and other problems, there is still a need for such investigations in the context of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Moreover, it has been assumed in previous works that the ways of using character n-grams in authorship attribution remain the same for intrinsic plagiarism detection. In this paper, we study the effect of character n-grams frequency and length on the performance of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Our experiments utilise two state-of-the-art methods and five large document collections of PAN labs written in English and Arabic. We demonstrate empirically that the low- and the high-frequency n-grams are not equally relevant for intrinsic plagiarism detection, but their performance depends on the way they are exploited.

"KeywordsSentiment analysis Opinion mining Sentiment shifters Shifter identification Association rule mining WARM Machine learning ","applying data mining and machine learning techniques for sentiment shifter identification","Sentiment shifters, as a set of words and expressions that can affect text polarity, play a fundamental role in opinion mining. However, the limited ability of current automated opinion mining systems in handling shifters is a major challenge. This paper presents three novel and efficient methods for identifying sentiment shifters in reviews in order to improve the overall accuracy of opinion mining systems: two data mining based algorithms and a machine learning based algorithm. The data mining algorithms do not need shifter tagged datasets. They use weighted association rule mining (WARM) for finding frequent patterns representing sentiment shifters from a domain-specific and a general corpus. These patterns include different kinds of shifter words such as shifter verbs and quantifiers and are able to handle both local and long-distance shifters. The items in WARM for the two designed methods are in the form of dependency relations and SRL arguments of sentences, respectively. Secondly, we implemented a supervised machine learning system based on semantic features of sentences for shifter identification and polarity classification. This method obviously needs shifter tagged dataset for shifter identification. We tested our proposed algorithms on polarity classification task for 2 domains: a specific domain (drug reviews) and a general domain. Experiments demonstrate that (1) the extracted shifters improve the performance of the polarity classification, (2) the proposed data mining methods outperform other implemented methods in shifter identification, and (3) the proposed semantic based machine learning method has the best efficiency among all implemented methods in polarity classification.

Second, we compare our statistics with qualitative comments in the New Testament research literature, and extend them to cover the entirety of the Gospels.

"KeywordsSpelling variation Non-standard language Historical texts Information retrieval ","token based spelling variant detection in middle low german texts","In this paper we present a pipeline for the detection of spelling variants, i.e., different spellings that represent the same word, in non-standard texts. For example, in Middle Low German texts in and ihn (among others) are potential spellings of a single word, the personal pronoun ‘him’. Spelling variation is usually addressed by normalization, in which non-standard variants are mapped to a corresponding standard variant, e.g. the Modern German word ihn in the case of in. However, the approach to spelling variant detection presented here does not need such a reference to a standard variant and can therefore be applied to data for which a standard variant is missing.
 The pipeline we present first generates spelling variants for a given word using rewrite rules and surface similarity. Afterwards, the generated types are filtered. We present a new filter that works on the token level, i.e., taking the context of a word into account. Through this mechanism ambiguities on the type level can be resolved. For instance, the Middle Low German word in can not only be the personal pronoun ‘him’, but also the preposition ‘in’, and each of these has different variants. The detected spelling variants can be used in two settings for Digital Humanities research: On the one hand, they can be used to facilitate searching in non-standard texts. On the other hand, they can be used to improve the performance of natural language processing tools on the data by reducing the number of unknown words.
 To evaluate the utility of the pipeline in both applications, we present two evaluation settings and evaluate the pipeline on Middle Low German texts. We were able to improve the F1 score compared with previous work from \(0.39\) to \(0.52\) for the search setting and from \(0.23\) to \(0.30\) when detecting spelling variants of unknown words.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"No","spell variat standard languag histor text inform retriev token base spell variant detect middl low german text paper present pipelin detect spell variant spell repres word standard text middl low german text ihn potenti spell singl word person pronoun spell variat address normal standard variant map standard variant modern german word ihn case approach spell variant detect present refer standard variant appli data standard variant miss pipelin present generat spell variant word rewrit rule surfac similar generat type filter present filter work token level take context word account mechan ambigu type level resolv instanc middl low german word person pronoun preposit variant detect spell variant set digit human research hand facilit search standard text hand improv perform natur languag process tool data reduc number unknown word evalu util pipelin applic present evalu set evalu pipelin middl low german text improv f score compar previous work search set detect spell variant unknown word",0

Urdu language processing presents a challenge due to the dual behaviour of various Urdu POS tags in differing situations (morphosyntactic ambiguity). This paper addresses this challenge by developing a novel tagging approach using linear-chain conditional random fields (CRF). Our work is the first instance of a CRF approach for Urdu POS tagging. The proposed model employs a strong, stable and balanced language-independent as well as language dependent feature set. The language-dependent feature considered includes part-of-speech tag of the previous word and suffix of the current word while the language-independent features includes the ‘context words window’. Our approach was evaluated against support vector machine techniques for Urdu POS—considered as state of the art—on two benchmark datasets.

"KeywordsMachine translation Machine translation evaluation MT metric Linguistic features Qualitative approach ","verta a linguistic approach to automatic machine translation evaluation","Machine translation (MT) is directly linked to its evaluation in order to both compare different MT system outputs and analyse system errors so that they can be addressed and corrected. As a consequence, MT evaluation has become increasingly important and popular in the last decade, leading to the development of MT evaluation metrics aiming at automatically assessing MT output. Most of these metrics use reference translations in order to compare system output, and the most well-known and widely spread work at lexical level. In this study we describe and present a linguistically-motivated metric, VERTa, which aims at using and combining a wide variety of linguistic features at lexical, morphological, syntactic and semantic level. Before designing and developing VERTa a qualitative linguistic analysis of data was performed so as to identify the linguistic phenomena that an MT metric must consider (Comelles et al. 2017). In the present study we introduce VERTa’s design and architecture and we report the experiments performed in order to develop the metric and to check the suitability and interaction of the linguistic information used. The experiments carried out go beyond traditional correlation scores and step towards a more qualitative approach based on linguistic analysis. Finally, in order to check the validity of the metric, an evaluation has been conducted comparing the metric’s performance to that of other well-known state-of-the-art MT metrics.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"No","machin translat machin translat evalu mt metric linguist featur qualit approach verta linguist approach automat machin translat evalu machin translat mt direct link evalu order compar mt system output analys system error address correct consequ mt evalu increas import popular decad lead develop mt evalu metric aim automat assess mt output metric refer translat order compar system output wide spread work lexic level studi describ present linguist motiv metric verta aim combin wide varieti linguist featur lexic morpholog syntact semant level design develop verta qualit linguist analysi data perform identifi linguist phenomena mt metric comell al present studi introduc verta design architectur report experi perform order develop metric check suitabl interact linguist inform experi carri tradit correl score step qualit approach base linguist analysi final order check valid metric evalu conduct compar metric perform state art mt metric",0

As first steps, the workflow usually involves batch scanning and optical character recognition (OCR) of documents. In the case of multi-page documents, the preservation of document contexts is a major requirement. To facilitate workflows involving very large amounts of paper scans, page stream segmentation (PSS) is the task to automatically separate a stream of scanned images into coherent multi-page documents. In a digitization project together with a German federal archive, we developed a novel approach for PSS based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). As a first project, we combine visual information from scanned images with semantic information from OCR-ed texts for this task. The multi-modal combination of features in a single classification architecture allows for major improvements towards optimal document separation.

NA,"the causality of borrowing lexical loans in eurasian languages","All languages borrow words from other languages. Some languages are more prone to borrowing, while others borrow less, and different domains of the vocabulary are unequally susceptible to borrowing. Languages typically borrow words when a new concept is introduced, but languages may also borrow a new word for an already existing concept. Linguists describe two causalities for borrowing: need, i.e., the internal pressure of borrowing a new term for a concept in the language, and prestige, i.e., the external pressure of borrowing a term from a more prestigious language.

The NDRA differs from existing models of response times in the reading aloud task in two ways. First, a single lexical architecture is responsible for both word and non-word naming. As such, the model differs from dual-route models, which consist of both a lexical route and a sub-lexical route that directly maps orthographic units onto phonological units. Second, the linguistic core of the NDRA exclusively operates on the basis of the equilibrium equations for the well-established general human learning algorithm provided by the Rescorla-Wagner model. The model therefore does not posit language-specific processing mechanisms and avoids the problems of psychological and neurobiological implausibility associated with alternative computational implementations.

One challenge in accessing online health information is to differentiate between factual and more subjective information.

In this context, our goal is to develop automatic methods that will make online health information more easily accessible and useful for patients, professionals and researchers.

In three studies, participants assumed the role of retailers. Alleged counterparts (actually a computerized program) asked for a discount under three conditions: request, want, and demand. Results show that less extreme language (request/want) resulted in better outcomes than demanding a discount. Moreover, while the language used by the customer had an effect on experienced emotions, the positive emotions (sympathy and empathy) participants felt toward the customer mediated the relationship between the linguistic cue and the negotiation outcome.

It has been proposed that this spread took place alongside with that of Bantu languages. In eastern and southeastern Africa, it is also linked to the Early Iron Age. From the beginning of the last millennium BC, cereal agriculture spread rapidly from the Great Lakes area eastwards to the East African coast, and southwards to northeastern South Africa. Here we show that the southwards spread took place substantially more rapidly (1.50–2.27 km/y) than the eastwards spread (0.59–1.27 km/y).

Like its predecessor, TAACO 2.0 is a freely available text analysis tool that works on the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems; is housed on a user’s hard drive; is easy to use; and allows for batch processing of text files. TAACO 2.0 includes all the original indices reported for TAACO 1.0, but it adds a number of new indices related to local and global cohesion at the semantic level, reported by latent semantic analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation, and word2vec. The tool also includes a source overlap feature, which calculates lexical and semantic overlap between a source and a response text (i.e., cohesion between the two texts based measures of text relatedness). In the first study in this article, we examined the effects that cohesion features, prompt, essay elaboration, and enhanced cohesion had on expert ratings of text coherence, finding that global semantic similarity as reported by word2vec was an important predictor of coherence ratings. A second study was conducted to examine the source and response indices. In this study we examined whether source overlap between the speaking samples found in the TOEFL-iBT integrated speaking tasks and the responses produced by test-takers was predictive of human ratings of speaking proficiency. The results indicated that the percentage of keywords found in both the source and response and the similarity between the source document and the response, as reported by word2vec, were significant predictors of speaking quality.

NA,"introduction to special issue beyond the lab using big data to discover principles of cognition","Like many other scientific disciplines, psychological science has felt the impact of the big-data revolution. This impact arises from the meeting of three forces: data availability, data heterogeneity, and data analyzability. In terms of data availability, consider that for decades, researchers relied on the Brown Corpus of about one million words (Kučera & Francis, 1969). Modern resources, in contrast, are larger by six orders of magnitude (e.g., Google’s 1T corpus) and are available in a growing number of languages. About 240 billion photos have been uploaded to Facebook,1 and Instagram receives over 100 million new photos each day.2 The large-scale digitization of these data has made it possible in principle to analyze and aggregate these resources on a previously unimagined scale. Heterogeneity refers to the availability of different types of data. For example, recent progress in automatic image recognition is owed not just to improvements in algorithms and hardware, but arguably more to the ability to merge large collections of images with linguistic labels (produced by crowdsourced human taggers) that serve as training data to the algorithms. Making use of heterogeneous data sources often depends on their standardization. For example, the ability to combine demographic and grammatical data about thousands of languages led to the finding that languages spoken by more people have simpler morphologies (Lupyan & Dale, 2010). The ability to combine these data types would have been substantially more difficult without the existence of standardized language and country codes that could be used to merge the different data sources. Finally, analyzability must be ensured, for without appropriate tools to process and analyze different types of data, the “data” are merely bytes.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","introduct special issu lab big data discov principl cognit scientif disciplin psycholog scienc felt impact big data revolut impact aris meet forc data avail data heterogen data analyz term data avail decad research reli brown corpus million word ku era franci modern resourc contrast larger order magnitud googl t corpus grow number languag billion photo upload facebook instagram receiv million photo day larg scale digit data made principl analyz aggreg resourc previous unimagin scale heterogen refer avail type data recent progress automat imag recognit owe improv algorithm hardwar arguabl abil merg larg collect imag linguist label produc crowdsourc human tagger serv train data algorithm make heterogen data sourc depend standard abil combin demograph grammat data thousand languag led find languag spoken peopl simpler morpholog lupyan dale abil combin data type substanti difficult exist standard languag countri code merg data sourc final analyz ensur tool process analyz type data data byte",0

The Glasgow Norms are unique in several respects. First, the corpus itself is relatively large, while simultaneously providing norms across a substantial number of lexical dimensions. Second, for any given subset of words, the same participants provided ratings across all nine dimensions (33 participants/word, on average). Third, two novel dimensions—semantic size and gender association—are included. Finally, the corpus contains a set of 379 ambiguous words that are presented either alone (e.g., toast) or with information that selects an alternative sense (e.g., toast (bread), toast (speech)). The relationships between the dimensions of the Glasgow Norms were initially investigated by assessing their correlations. In addition, a principal component analysis revealed four main factors, accounting for 82% of the variance (Visualization, Emotion, Salience, and Exposure). The validity of the Glasgow Norms was established via comparisons of our ratings to 18 different sets of current psycholinguistic norms. The dimension of size was tested with megastudy data, confirming findings from past studies that have explicitly examined this variable. Alternative senses of ambiguous words (i.e., disambiguated forms), when discordant on a given dimension, seemingly led to appropriately distinct ratings. Informal comparisons between the ratings of ambiguous words and of their alternative senses showed different patterns that likely depended on several factors (the number of senses, their relative strengths, and the rating scales themselves). Overall, the Glasgow Norms provide a valuable resource—in particular, for researchers investigating the role of word recognition in language comprehension.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes","psycholinguist norm arous valenc domin concret imag familiar age acquisit semant size gender associ glasgow norm rate word scale glasgow norm set normat rate english word psycholinguist dimens arous valenc domin concret imag familiar age acquisit semant size gender associ glasgow norm uniqu respect corpus larg simultan provid norm substanti number lexic dimens subset word particip provid rate dimens participantsword averag dimens semant size gender associ includ final corpus set ambigu word present toast inform select altern sens toast bread toast speech relationship dimens glasgow norm initi investig assess correl addit princip compon analysi reveal main factor account varianc visual emot salienc exposur valid glasgow norm establish comparison rate set current psycholinguist norm dimens size test megastudi data confirm find past studi explicit examin variabl altern sens ambigu word disambigu form discord dimens seem led appropri distinct rate inform comparison rate ambigu word altern sens show pattern depend factor number sens relat strength rate scale glasgow norm provid valuabl resourc research investig role word recognit languag comprehens",1
"KeywordsPerceptual strength Norms Regression Psycholinguistic variables ","visual and auditory perceptual strength norms for 3596 french nouns and their relationship with other psycholinguistic variables","Perceptual experience plays a critical role in the conceptual representation of words. Higher levels of semantic variables such as imageability, concreteness, and sensory experience are generally associated with faster and more accurate word processing. Nevertheless, these variables tend to be assessed mostly on the basis of visual experience. This underestimates the potential contributions of other perceptual modalities. Accordingly, recent evidence has stressed the importance of providing modality-specific perceptual strength norms. In the present study, we developed French Canadian norms of visual and auditory perceptual strength (i.e., the modalities that have major impact on word processing) for 3,596 nouns. We then explored the relationship between these newly developed variables and other lexical, orthographic, and semantic variables. Finally, we demonstrated the contributions of visual and auditory perceptual strength ratings to visual word processing beyond those of other semantic variables related to perceptual experience (e.g., concreteness, imageability, and sensory experience ratings). The ratings developed in this study are a meaningful contribution toward the implementation of new studies that will shed further light on the interaction between linguistic, semantic, and perceptual systems.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes","perceptu strength norm regress psycholinguist variabl visual auditori perceptu strength norm french noun relationship psycholinguist variabl perceptu experi play critic role conceptu represent word higher level semant variabl imag concret sensori experi general faster accur word process variabl tend assess basi visual experi underestim potenti contribut perceptu modal recent evid stress import provid modal specif perceptu strength norm present studi develop french canadian norm visual auditori perceptu strength modal major impact word process noun explor relationship newli develop variabl lexic orthograph semant variabl final demonstr contribut visual auditori perceptu strength rate visual word process semant variabl relat perceptu experi concret imag sensori experi rate rate develop studi meaning contribut implement studi shed light interact linguist semant perceptu system",1

Our procedure allowed subjects to provide multiple responses for each cue, which permits us to measure weak associations.

However, norms for a crucial semantic variable—that is, conceptual familiarity—have not been available for a sizeable French database. We thus developed French Canadian conceptual familiarity norms for 3,596 nouns. This enriches Desrochers and Thompson’s (2009) database, in which subjective frequency and imageability values are already available for the same words. We collected online data from 313 Canadian French speakers. The full database of conceptual familiarity ratings is freely available at http://lingualab.ca/fr/projets/normes-de-familiarite-conceptuelle. We then demonstrated the utility of these new conceptual familiarity norms by assessing their contribution to lexical decision times. We conducted a stepwise regression model with conceptual familiarity in the last step. This allowed us to assess the independent contribution of conceptual familiarity beyond the contributions of other well-known psycholinguistic variables, such as frequency, imageability, and age of acquisition. The results showed that conceptual familiarity facilitated lexical decision latencies.

"KeywordsSemantic ambiguity Homonyms Meaning frequency Homonym norming methods and data Movie subtitles Free association Homonym meaning annotations ","a comparison of homonym meaning frequency estimates derived from movie and television subtitles free association and explicit ratings","Most words are ambiguous, with interpretation dependent on context. Advancing theories of ambiguity resolution is important for any general theory of language processing, and for resolving inconsistencies in observed ambiguity effects across experimental tasks. Focusing on homonyms (words such as bank with unrelated meanings EDGE OF A RIVER vs. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION), the present work advances theories and methods for estimating the relative frequency of their meanings, a factor that shapes observed ambiguity effects. We develop a new method for estimating meaning frequency based on the meaning of a homonym evoked in lines of movie and television subtitles according to human raters. We also replicate and extend a measure of meaning frequency derived from the classification of free associates. We evaluate the internal consistency of these measures, compare them to published estimates based on explicit ratings of each meaning’s frequency, and compare each set of norms in predicting performance in lexical and semantic decision mega-studies. All measures have high internal consistency and show agreement, but each is also associated with unique variance, which may be explained by integrating cognitive theories of memory with the demands of different experimental methodologies. To derive frequency estimates, we collected manual classifications of 533 homonyms over 50,000 lines of subtitles, and of 357 homonyms across over 5000 homonym–associate pairs.

We also report several tests of reliability and validity, demonstrating that our historical concreteness scores have high levels of both. Study 2 uses concreteness scores to revisit findings of studies that use a static set of contemporary human concreteness norms to examine historical trends of semantic change. Specifically, we observed (contra Hills & Adelman, (Cognition, 143, 87–92 2015)) that distinct word types of the English language become increasingly more concrete over time and (in line with Hills & Adelman, (Cognition, 143, 87–92 2015) & Hills, Adelman & Noguchi, (The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 70(8), 1603–1619 2016)) that relatively concrete words tend to be used more often than abstract ones.

"KeywordsContinuous norming GAMLSS Box-Cox power exponential distribution Posterior simulation Psychological tests ","improving confidence intervals for normed test scores include uncertainty due to sampling variability","Test publishers usually provide confidence intervals (CIs) for normed test scores that reflect the uncertainty due to the unreliability of the tests. The uncertainty due to sampling variability in the norming phase is ignored. To express uncertainty due to norming, we propose a flexible method that is applicable in continuous norming and allows for a variety of score distributions, using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS; Rigby & Stasinopoulos, 2005). We assessed the performance of this method in a simulation study, by examining the quality of the resulting CIs. We varied the population model, procedure of estimating the CI, confidence level, sample size, value of the predictor, extremity of the test score, and type of variance-covariance matrix. The results showed that good quality of the CIs could be achieved in most conditions. The method is illustrated using normative data of the SON-R 6-40 test. We recommend test developers to use this approach to arrive at CIs, and thus properly express the uncertainty due to norm sampling fluctuations, in the context of continuous norming. Adopting this approach will help (e.g., clinical) practitioners to obtain a fair picture of the person assessed.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","continu norm gamlss box cox power exponenti distribut posterior simul psycholog test improv confid interv norm test score includ uncertainti due sampl variabl test publish provid confid interv cis norm test score reflect uncertainti due unreli test uncertainti due sampl variabl norm phase express uncertainti due norm propos flexibl method applic continu norm varieti score distribut general addit model locat scale shape gamlss rigbi stasinopoulo assess perform method simul studi examin qualiti result cis vari popul model procedur estim ci confid level sampl size predictor extrem test score type varianc covari matrix result show good qualiti cis achiev condit method illustr normat data son test recommend test develop approach arriv cis proper express uncertainti due norm sampl fluctuat context continu norm adopt approach clinic practition obtain fair pictur person assess",0

Researchers have studied the effects of BOI in order to investigate the relationships between sensorimotor and cognitive processes. Such efforts could be improved, however, by the availability of more extensive BOI norms. In the present work, we collected BOI ratings for over 9,000 words. These new norms show good reliability and validity and have extensive overlap with the words used both in other lexical and semantic norms and in the available behavioral megastudies (e.g., the English Lexicon Project, Balota, Yap, Cortese, Hutchison, Kessler, & Loftis in Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007; and the Calgary Semantic Decision Project, Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017). In analyses using the new BOI norms, we found that high-BOI words tended to be more concrete, more graspable, and more strongly associated with sensory, haptic, and visual experience than are low-BOI words. When we used the new norms to predict response latencies and accuracy data from the behavioral megastudies, we found that BOI was a stronger predictor of responses in the semantic decision task than in the lexical decision task. These findings are consistent with a dynamic, multidimensional account of lexical semantics.

This article introduces the spreadr R package, which can implement spreading activation within a specified network structure. The algorithmic method implemented in the spreadr subroutines follows the approach described in Vitevitch, Ercal, and Adagarla (Frontiers in Psychology, 2, 369, 2011), who viewed activation as a fixed cognitive resource that could “spread” among connected nodes in a network. Three sets of simulations were conducted using the package. The first set of simulations successfully reproduced the results reported in Vitevitch et al. (Frontiers in Psychology, 2, 369, 2011), who showed that a simple mechanism of spreading activation could account for the clustering coefficient effect in spoken word recognition. The second set of simulations showed that the same mechanism could be extended to account for higher false alarm rates for low clustering coefficient words in a false memory task. The final set of simulations demonstrated how spreading activation could be applied to a semantic network to account for semantic priming effects. It is hoped that this package will encourage cognitive and language scientists to explicitly consider how the structures of cognitive systems such as the mental lexicon and semantic memory interact with the process of spreading activation.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","spread activ network scienc comput simul lexic retriev fals memori cluster coeffici semant prime semant network spreadr packag simul spread activ network notion spread activ central theme cognit scienc tool implement spread activ comput readili articl introduc spreadr packag implement spread activ network structur algorithm method implement spreadr subroutin approach vitevitch ercal adagarla frontier psycholog view activ fix cognit resourc spread connect node network set simul conduct packag set simul success reproduc result report vitevitch al frontier psycholog show simpl mechan spread activ account cluster coeffici effect spoken word recognit set simul show mechan extend account higher fals alarm rate low cluster coeffici word fals memori task final set simul demonstr spread activ appli semant network account semant prime effect hope packag encourag cognit languag scientist explicit structur cognit system mental lexicon semant memori interact process spread activ",0
"KeywordsPitch perception Musical abilities Pitch accuracy Gold-MSI ","the mistuning perception test a new measurement instrument","An important aspect of the perceived quality of vocal music is the degree to which the vocalist sings in tune. Although most listeners seem sensitive to vocal mistuning, little is known about the development of this perceptual ability or how it differs between listeners. Motivated by a lack of suitable preexisting measures, we introduce in this article an adaptive and ecologically valid test of mistuning perception ability. The stimulus material consisted of short excerpts (6 to 12 s in length) from pop music performances (obtained from MedleyDB; Bittner et al., 2014) for which the vocal track was pitch-shifted relative to the instrumental tracks. In a first experiment, 333 listeners were tested on a two-alternative forced choice task that tested discrimination between a pitch-shifted and an unaltered version of the same audio clip. Explanatory item response modeling was then used to calibrate an adaptive version of the test. A subsequent validation experiment applied this adaptive test to 66 participants with a broad range of musical expertise, producing evidence of the test’s reliability, convergent validity, and divergent validity. The test is ready to be deployed as an experimental tool and should make an important contribution to our understanding of the human ability to judge mistuning.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","pitch percept music abil pitch accuraci gold msi mistun percept test measur instrument import aspect perceiv qualiti vocal music degre vocalist sing tune listen sensit vocal mistun develop perceptu abil differ listen motiv lack suitabl preexist measur introduc articl adapt ecolog valid test mistun percept abil stimulus materi consist short excerpt length pop music perform obtain medleydb bittner al vocal track pitch shift relat instrument track experi listen test altern forc choic task test discrimin pitch shift unalt version audio clip explanatori item respons model calibr adapt version test subsequ valid experi appli adapt test particip broad rang music expertis produc evid test reliabl converg valid diverg valid test readi deploy experiment tool make import contribut understand human abil judg mistun",0

However, there has been a lack of normed studies describing generalizable principles in gesture production and in comprehension of the mappings of different types of iconic strategies (i.e., modes of representation; Müller, 2013). In Study 1 we elicited silent gestures in order to explore the implementation of different types of iconic representation (i.e., acting, representing, drawing, and personification) to express concepts across five semantic domains. In Study 2 we investigated the degree of meaning transparency (i.e., iconicity ratings) of the gestures elicited in Study 1. We found systematicity in the gestural forms of 109 concepts across all participants, with different types of iconicity aligning with specific semantic domains: Acting was favored for actions and manipulable objects, drawing for nonmanipulable objects, and personification for animate entities. Interpretation of gesture–meaning transparency was modulated by the interaction between mode of representation and semantic domain, with some couplings being more transparent than others: Acting yielded higher ratings for actions, representing for object-related concepts, personification for animate entities, and drawing for nonmanipulable entities. This study provides mapping principles that may extend to all forms of manual communication (gesture and sign). This database includes a list of the most systematic silent gestures in the group of participants, a notation of the form of each gesture based on four features (hand configuration, orientation, placement, and movement), each gesture’s mode of representation, iconicity ratings, and professionally filmed videos that can be used for experimental and clinical endeavors.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes","icon silent gestur mode represent percept icon norm databas systemat map semant categori type icon represent manual modal norm databas silent gestur unpreced number empir studi shown icon gestur mimic sensorimotor attribut refer contribut signific languag acquisit percept process lack norm studi describ generaliz principl gestur product comprehens map type icon strategi mode represent ller studi elicit silent gestur order explor implement type icon represent act repres draw personif express concept semant domain studi investig degre mean transpar icon rate gestur elicit studi found systemat gestur form concept particip type icon align specif semant domain act favor action manipul object draw nonmanipul object personif anim entiti interpret gestur mean transpar modul interact mode represent semant domain coupl transpar act yield higher rate action repres object relat concept personif anim entiti draw nonmanipul entiti studi map principl extend form manual communic gestur sign databas includ list systemat silent gestur group particip notat form gestur base featur hand configur orient placement movement gestur mode represent icon rate profession film video experiment clinic endeavor",1

A rate-limiting factor in answering such questions is the challenge of recruiting rare DP participants. Although self-reported experiences have long played a role in efforts to identify DPs, much remains unknown about how such self-reports can or should contribute to screening or diagnosis. Here, in a large, population-based web sample, we investigated the effectiveness of self-report, used on its own, as a screen to identify individuals who will ultimately fail, at a conventional cutoff, the two types of objective tests that are most commonly used to confirm DP diagnoses: the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) and the famous faces memory test (FFMT). We used a highly reliable questionnaire (alpha = .91), the Cambridge Face Memory Questionnaire (CFMQ), and revealed strong validity via high correlations of .44 with the CFMT and .52 with the FFMT. However, cutoff analyses revealed that no CFMQ score yielded a clinical-grade combination of sensitivity and positive predictive value in enough individuals to support using it alone as a DP diagnostic or screening tool. This result was replicated in an analysis of data from the widely used PI20 questionnaire, a 20-question self-assessment of facial recognition similar in form to the CFMQ. We therefore recommend that screens for DP should, wherever possible, include objective as well as subjective assessment tools.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","report abil individu differ face recognit screen prosopagnosia meta cognit report face recognit high valid high discrimin prosopagnosia level perform object assess sever development deficit face recognit abil development prosopagnosia dp vigor studi past decad question remain unansw origin natur social consequ rate limit factor answer question challeng recruit rare dp particip report experi long play role effort identifi dps remain unknown report contribut screen diagnosi larg popul base web sampl investig effect report screen identifi individu ultim fail convent cutoff type object test common confirm dp diagnos cambridg face memori test cfmt famous face memori test ffmt high reliabl questionnair alpha cambridg face memori questionnair cfmq reveal strong valid high correl cfmt ffmt cutoff analys reveal cfmq score yield clinic grade combin sensit posit predict individu support dp diagnost screen tool result replic analysi data wide pi questionnair question assess facial recognit similar form cfmq recommend screen dp includ object subject assess tool",0
"KeywordsStatistical learning Individual differences Reliability Domain generality Children ","do current statistical learning tasks capture stable individual differences in children an investigation of task reliability across modality","Do commonly used statistical-learning tasks capture stable individual differences in children? Infants, children, and adults are capable of using statistical learning (SL) to extract information about their environment. Although most studies have looked at group-level performance, a growing literature examines individual differences in SL and their relation to language-learning outcomes: Individuals who are better at SL are expected to show better linguistic abilities. Accordingly, studies have shown positive correlations between SL performance and language outcomes in both children and adults. However, these studies have often used tasks designed to explore group-level performance without modifying them, resulting in psychometric shortcomings that impact reliability in adults (Siegelman, Bogaerts, Christiansen, & Frost in Transactions of the Royal Society B, 372, 20160059, 2017a; Siegelman, Bogaerts, & Frost in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 418–432, 2017b). Even though similar measures are used to assess individual differences in children, no study to date has examined the reliability of these measures in development. This study examined the reliability of common SL measures in both children and adults. It assessed the reliability of three SL tasks (two auditory and one visual) twice (two months apart) in adults and children (mean age 8 years). Although the tasks showed moderate reliability in adults, they did not capture stable individual variation in children. None of the tasks were reliable across sessions, and all showed internal consistency measures well below psychometric standards. These findings raise significant concerns about the use of current SL measures to predict and explain individual differences in development. The article ends with a discussion of possible explanations for the difference in reliability between children and adults.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","statist learn individu differ reliabl domain general children current statist learn task captur stabl individu differ children investig task reliabl modal common statist learn task captur stabl individu differ children infant children adult capabl statist learn sl extract inform environ studi look group level perform grow literatur examin individu differ sl relat languag learn outcom individu sl expect show linguist abil studi shown posit correl sl perform languag outcom children adult studi task design explor group level perform modifi result psychometr shortcom impact reliabl adult siegelman bogaert christiansen frost transact royal societi a siegelman bogaert frost behavior research method b similar measur assess individu differ children studi date examin reliabl measur develop studi examin reliabl common sl measur children adult assess reliabl sl task auditori visual month adult children age year task show moder reliabl adult captur stabl individu variat children task reliabl session show intern consist measur psychometr standard find rais signific concern current sl measur predict explain individu differ develop articl end discuss explan differ reliabl children adult",0

Regressions showed that frequency, age of acquisition, and the word context (in which a character appears) are all-around and influential predictors of orthographic access (as reflected in writing latency), motor execution of handwriting (as reflected in writing duration), and accuracy. In addition, phonological factors (phonogram status, spelling regularity, and homophone density) impacted orthographic access but not handwriting execution. Semantic factors (imageability and concreteness) only affected accuracy. These results suggest, among other things, that phonology is consulted in orthographic access while handwriting.

Using co-occurrence patterns, the Macroscope can track changes in semantics, allowing researchers to identify semantically stable and unstable words in historical text and providing quantitative information about changes in a word’s valence, arousal, and concreteness, as well as information about new properties, such as semantic drift. The Macroscope provides information about both the local and global properties of words, as well as information about how these properties change over time, allowing researchers to visualize and download data in order to make inferences about historical psychology.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the standardized regression coefficients belonging to regression models that include different sets of covariates do not represent the same parameter, and thus their direct combination is meaningless. In the present study, a new approach called concealed correlations meta-analysis is proposed that allows for using the common information that standardized regression coefficients from different regression models contain to improve the precision of a combined focal standardized regression coefficient estimate. The performance of this new approach was compared with that of two other approaches: (1) carrying out separate meta-analyses for standardized regression coefficients from studies that used the same regression model, and (2) performing a meta-regression on the focal standardized regression coefficients while including an indicator variable as a moderator indicating the regression model to which each standardized regression coefficient belongs. The comparison was done through a simulation study. The results showed that, as expected, the proposed approach led to more accurate estimates of the combined standardized regression coefficients under both random- and fixed-effect models.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","meta analysi standard regress coeffici effect size conceal correl meta analysi method synthes standard regress coeffici synthesi standard regress coeffici controversi issu field meta analysi difficulti lie fact standard regress coeffici belong regress model includ set covari repres paramet direct combin meaningless present studi approach call conceal correl meta analysi propos common inform standard regress coeffici regress model improv precis combin focal standard regress coeffici estim perform approach compar approach carri separ meta analys standard regress coeffici studi regress model perform meta regress focal standard regress coeffici includ indic variabl moder indic regress model standard regress coeffici belong comparison simul studi result show expect propos approach led accur estim combin standard regress coeffici random fix effect model",0
"KeywordsQuestions on honest responding Socially desirable responding Sensitive questions Self-reports Internet surveys ","questions on honest responding","This article presents a new method for reducing socially desirable responding in Internet self-reports of desirable and undesirable behavior. The method is based on moving the request for honest responding, often included in the introduction to surveys, to the questioning phase of the survey. Over a quarter of Internet survey participants do not read survey instructions, and therefore, instead of asking respondents to answer honestly, they were asked whether they responded honestly. Posing the honesty message in the form of questions on honest responding draws attention to the message, increases the processing of it, and puts subsequent questions in context with the questions on honest responding. In three studies (nStudy I = 475, nStudy II = 1,015, nStudy III = 899), we tested whether presenting the questions on honest responding before questions on desirable and undesirable behavior could increase the honesty of responses, under the assumption that less attribution of desirable behavior and/or admitting to more undesirable behavior could be taken to indicate more honest responses. In all studies the participants who were presented with the questions on honest responding before questions on the target behavior produced, on average, significantly less socially desirable responses, though the effect sizes were small in all cases (Cohen’s d ranging between 0.02 and 0.28 for single items, and from 0.17 to 0.34 for sum scores).

"KeywordsBody-object interaction Semantic decision task Lexical decision task Motor ratings Visual word recognition ","getting a grip on sensorimotor effects in lexicalsemantic processing","One of the strategies that researchers have used to investigate the role of sensorimotor information in lexical–semantic processing is to examine the effects of words’ rated body–object interaction (BOI; i.e., the ease with which the human body can interact with a word’s referent). Processing tends to be facilitated for words with high as compared with low BOI, across a wide variety of tasks. Such effects have been referenced in debates over the nature of semantic representations, but their theoretical import has been limited by the fact that BOI is a fairly coarse measure of sensorimotor experience with words’ referents. In the present study, we collected ratings for 621 words on seven semantic dimensions (graspability, ease of pantomime, number of actions, animacy, size, danger, and usefulness), in order to investigate which attributes are most strongly related to BOI ratings and to lexical–semantic processing. BOI ratings were obtained from previous norming studies (Bennett, Burnett, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 43, 1100–1109, 2011; Tillotson, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 40, 1075–1078, 2008), and measures of lexical–semantic processing were obtained from previous behavioral megastudies involving either the semantic categorization task (concrete/abstract decision; Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017) or the lexical decision task (Balota et al., Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007). The results showed that the motor dimensions of graspability, ease of pantomime, and number of actions were all related to BOI, and that these dimensions together explained more variance in semantic processing than did the BOI ratings alone. These ratings will be useful for researchers who wish to study how different kinds of bodily interactions influence lexical–semantic processing and cognition.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","bodi object interact semant decis task lexic decis task motor rate visual word recognit grip sensorimotor effect lexicalsemant process strategi research investig role sensorimotor inform lexic semant process examin effect word rate bodi object interact boi eas human bodi interact word refer process facilit word high compar low boi wide varieti task effect referenc debat natur semant represent theoret import limit fact boi fair coars measur sensorimotor experi word refer present studi collect rate word semant dimens graspabl eas pantomim number action animaci size danger use order investig attribut strong relat boi rate lexic semant process boi rate obtain previous norm studi bennett burnett siakaluk pexman behavior research method tillotson siakaluk pexman behavior research method measur lexic semant process obtain previous behavior megastudi involv semant categor task concreteabstract decis pexman heard lloyd yap behavior research method lexic decis task balota al behavior research method result show motor dimens graspabl eas pantomim number action relat boi dimens explain varianc semant process boi rate rate research studi kind bodili interact influenc lexic semant process cognit",0
"Keywordsᅟ ","the rippling dynamics of valenced messages in naturalistic youth chat","Even though human behavior is largely driven by real-time feedback from others, this social complexity is underrepresented in psychological theory, largely because it is so difficult to isolate. In this work, we performed a quasi-experimental analysis of hundreds of millions of chat room messages between young people. This allowed us to reconstruct how—and on what timeline—the valence of one message affects the valence of subsequent messages by others. For the highly emotionally valenced chat messages that we focused on, we found that these messages elicited a general increase of 0.1 to 0.4 messages per minute. This influence started 2 s after the original message and continued out to 60 s. Expanding our focus to include feedback loops—the way a speaker’s chat comes back to affect him or her—we found that the stimulating effects of these same chat events started rippling back from others 8 s after the original message, to cause an increase in the speaker’s chat that persisted for up to 8 min. This feedback accounted for at least 1% of the bulk of chat. Additionally, a message’s valence affects its dynamics, with negative events feeding back more slowly and continuing to affect the speaker longer. By reconstructing the second-by-second dynamics of many psychosocial processes in aggregate, we captured the timescales at which they collectively ripple through a social system to drive system-level outcomes.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","rippl dynam valenc messag naturalist youth chat human behavior larg driven real time feedback social complex underrepres psycholog theori larg difficult isol work perform quasi experiment analysi hundr million chat room messag young peopl allow reconstruct timelin valenc messag affect valenc subsequ messag high emot valenc chat messag focus found messag elicit general increas messag minut influenc start origin messag continu expand focus includ feedback loop speaker chat back affect found stimul effect chat event start rippl back origin messag increas speaker chat persist min feedback account bulk chat addit messag valenc affect dynam negat event feed back slowli continu affect speaker longer reconstruct dynam psychosoci process aggreg captur timescal collect rippl social system drive system level outcom",0
"KeywordsPrototypicality Genre Film Language Computerized text analysis ","genre typical narrative arcs in films are less appealing to lay audiences and professional film critics","People tend to like stimuli—ranging from human faces to text—that are prototypical, and thus easily processed. However, recent research has suggested that less typical stimuli may be preferred in creative contexts, such as fine art or music lyrics. In an archival sample of movie scripts, we tested whether genre-typicality predicted film ratings as a function of rater role (novice audience member or expert film critic). Genre-typicality was operationalized as the profile correlations between linguistic arcs (across five segments, or acts) for each script and within-genre averages. We predicted (1) that critics would prefer more disfluent (genre-atypical) films and general audiences would prefer fluent (genre-typical) films, and (2) that these differences would be most pronounced for genres expected to be more entertaining (e.g., action/adventure) than challenging (e.g., tragedy). Partly consistent with our hypotheses, the results showed that critics gave higher ratings to action/adventure films with less typical positive emotion arcs. However, regardless of audience-member or professional-critic status, higher ratings were attributed to films that were more genre-atypical (or disfluent), in terms of analytic thinking, narrative action, and emotional tone, across all genres except family/kids films. Such findings support the growing literature on the appeal of disfluency in the arts and have relevance for researchers in psychology and computer science who are interested in computational linguistic approaches to attitudes, film, and literature.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","prototyp genr film languag computer text analysi genr typic narrat arc film appeal lay audienc profession film critic peopl tend stimuli rang human face text prototyp easili process recent research suggest typic stimuli prefer creativ context fine art music lyric archiv sampl movi script test genr typic predict film rate function rater role novic audienc member expert film critic genr typic operation profil correl linguist arc segment act script genr averag predict critic prefer disfluent genr atyp film general audienc prefer fluent genr typic film differ pronounc genr expect entertain actionadventur challeng tragedi part consist hypothes result show critic gave higher rate actionadventur film typic posit emot arc audienc member profession critic status higher rate attribut film genr atyp disfluent term analyt think narrat action emot tone genr familykid film find support grow literatur appeal disfluenc art relev research psycholog comput scienc interest comput linguist approach attitud film literatur",0

"KeywordsPupillometry Executive functioning Arousal Cognitive load Psychophysics ","the human task evoked pupillary response function is linear implications for baseline response scaling in pupillometry","The human task-evoked pupillary response provides a sensitive physiological index of the intensity and online resource demands of numerous cognitive processes (e.g., memory retrieval, problem solving, or target detection). Cognitive pupillometry is a well-established technique that relies upon precise measurement of these subtle response functions. Baseline variability of pupil diameter is a complex artifact that typically necessitates mathematical correction. A methodological paradox within pupillometry is that linear and nonlinear forms of baseline scaling both remain accepted baseline correction techniques, despite yielding highly disparate results. The task-evoked pupillary response (TEPR) could potentially scale nonlinearly, similar to autonomic functions such as heart rate, in which the amplitude of an evoked response diminishes as the baseline rises. Alternatively, the TEPR could scale similarly to the cortical hemodynamic response, as a linear function that is independent of its baseline. However, the TEPR cannot scale both linearly and nonlinearly. Our aim was to adjudicate between linear and nonlinear scaling of human TEPR.

"KeywordsNavigation Route learning Navigation test Cognitive aging ","a novel virtual reality based route learning test suite assessing the effects of cognitive aging on navigation","Most research groups studying human navigational behavior with virtual environment (VE) technology develop their own tasks and protocols. This makes it difficult to compare results between groups and to create normative data sets for any specific navigational task. Such norms, however, are prerequisites for the use of navigation assessments as diagnostic tools—for example, to support the early and differential diagnosis of atypical aging. Here we start addressing these problems by presenting and evaluating a new navigation test suite that we make freely available to other researchers (https://osf.io/mx52y/). Specifically, we designed three navigational tasks, which are adaptations of earlier published tasks used to study the effects of typical and atypical aging on navigation: a route-repetition task that can be solved using egocentric navigation strategies, and route-retracing and directional-approach tasks that both require allocentric spatial processing. Despite introducing a number of changes to the original tasks to make them look more realistic and ecologically valid, and therefore easy to explain to people unfamiliar with a VE or who have cognitive impairments, we replicated the findings from the original studies. Specifically, we found general age-related declines in navigation performance and additional specific difficulties in tasks that required allocentric processes. These findings demonstrate that our new tasks have task demands similar to those of the original tasks, and are thus suited to be used more widely.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","navig rout learn navig test cognit age virtual realiti base rout learn test suit assess effect cognit age navig research group studi human navig behavior virtual environ ve technolog develop task protocol make difficult compar result group creat normat data set specif navig task norm prerequisit navig assess diagnost tool support earli differenti diagnosi atyp age start address problem present evalu navig test suit make freeli research httpsosfiomxi specif design navig task adapt earlier publish task studi effect typic atyp age navig rout repetit task solv egocentr navig strategi rout retrac direct approach task requir allocentr spatial process introduc number origin task make realist ecolog valid easi explain peopl unfamiliar ve cognit impair replic find origin studi specif found general age relat declin navig perform addit specif difficulti task requir allocentr process find demonstr task task demand similar origin task suit wide",0
"KeywordsEye tracking Nystagmus Calibration ","a robust method for calibration of eye tracking data recorded during nystagmus","Eye tracking is a useful tool when studying the oscillatory eye movements associated with nystagmus. However, this oscillatory nature of nystagmus is problematic during calibration since it introduces uncertainty about where the person is actually looking. This renders comparisons between separate recordings unreliable. Still, the influence of the calibration protocol on eye movement data from people with nystagmus has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we propose a calibration method using Procrustes analysis in combination with an outlier correction algorithm, which is based on a model of the calibration data and on the geometry of the experimental setup. The proposed method is compared to previously used calibration polynomials in terms of accuracy, calibration plane distortion and waveform robustness. Six recordings of calibration data, validation data and optokinetic nystagmus data from people with nystagmus and seven recordings from a control group were included in the study. Fixation errors during the recording of calibration data from the healthy participants were introduced, simulating fixation errors caused by the oscillatory movements found in nystagmus data. The outlier correction algorithm improved the accuracy for all tested calibration methods. The accuracy and calibration plane distortion performance of the Procrustes analysis calibration method were similar to the top performing mapping functions for the simulated fixation errors. The performance in terms of waveform robustness was superior for the Procrustes analysis calibration compared to the other calibration methods. The overall performance of the Procrustes calibration methods was best for the datasets containing errors during the calibration.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","eye track nystagmus calibr robust method calibr eye track data record nystagmus eye track tool studi oscillatori eye movement nystagmus oscillatori natur nystagmus problemat calibr introduc uncertainti person render comparison separ record unreli influenc calibr protocol eye movement data peopl nystagmus investig work propos calibr method procrust analysi combin outlier correct algorithm base model calibr data geometri experiment setup propos method compar previous calibr polynomi term accuraci calibr plane distort waveform robust record calibr data valid data optokinet nystagmus data peopl nystagmus record control group includ studi fixat error record calibr data healthi particip introduc simul fixat error caus oscillatori movement found nystagmus data outlier correct algorithm improv accuraci test calibr method accuraci calibr plane distort perform procrust analysi calibr method similar top perform map function simul fixat error perform term waveform robust superior procrust analysi calibr compar calibr method perform procrust calibr method dataset error calibr",0
"KeywordsNonlinear mixed-effects location scale model Verbal learning Intra-individual variability Bayesian inference ","a bayesian nonlinear mixed effects location scale model for learning","We present a Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects location scale model (NL-MELSM). The NL-MELSM allows for fitting nonlinear functions to the location, or individual means, and the scale, or within-person variance. Specifically, in the context of learning, this model allows the within-person variance to follow a nonlinear trajectory, where it can be determined whether variability reduces during learning. It incorporates a sub-model that can predict nonlinear parameters for both the location and scale. This specification estimates random effects for all nonlinear location and scale parameters that are drawn from a common multivariate distribution. This allows estimation of covariances among the random effects, within and across the location and the scale. These covariances offer new insights into the interplay between individual mean structures and intra-individual variability in nonlinear parameters. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only for ease of estimation but also for inference because it provides the necessary and consistent information for use in psychological applications, such as model selection and hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model, we use data from 333 individuals, consisting of three age groups, who participated in five learning trials that assessed verbal memory. In an exploratory context, we demonstrate that fitting a nonlinear function to the within-person variance, and allowing for individual variation therein, improves predictive accuracy compared to customary modeling techniques (e.g., assuming constant variance). We conclude by discussing the usefulness, limitations, and future directions of the NL-MELSM.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","nonlinear mix effect locat scale model verbal learn intra individu variabl bayesian infer bayesian nonlinear mix effect locat scale model learn present bayesian nonlinear mix effect locat scale model nl melsm nl melsm fit nonlinear function locat individu mean scale person varianc specif context learn model person varianc follow nonlinear trajectori determin variabl reduc learn incorpor model predict nonlinear paramet locat scale specif estim random effect nonlinear locat scale paramet drawn common multivari distribut estim covari random effect locat scale covari offer insight interplay individu structur intra individu variabl nonlinear paramet fulli bayesian approach eas estim infer consist inform psycholog applic model select hypothesi test illustr model data individu consist age group particip learn trial assess verbal memori exploratori context demonstr fit nonlinear function person varianc allow individu variat improv predict accuraci compar customari model techniqu assum constant varianc conclud discuss use limit futur direct nl melsm",0

Indeed, even if paying one respondent to complete one questionnaire represents a very small cost, the multiplication of botnets providing invalid response sets may ultimately reduce study validity while increasing research costs. Several techniques have been proposed thus far to detect problematic human response sets, but little research has been undertaken to test the extent to which they actually detect nonhuman response sets. Thus, we proposed to conduct an empirical comparison of these indices. Assuming that most botnet programs are based on random uniform distributions of responses, we present and compare seven indices in this study to detect nonhuman response sets. A sample of 1,967 human respondents was mixed with different percentages (i.e., from 5% to 50%) of simulated random response sets. Three of the seven indices (i.e., response coherence, Mahalanobis distance, and person–total correlation) appear to be the best estimators for detecting nonhuman response sets. Given that two of those indices—Mahalanobis distance and person–total correlation—are calculated easily, every researcher working with online questionnaires could use them to screen for the presence of such invalid data.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","botnet function method mahalanobi distanc mechan turk person total correl random respond respons coher detect comput generat random respond questionnair base data comparison indic develop onlin data collect instrument amazon mechan turk mturk appear malici softwar generat respons survey order earn money repres major issu econom scientif reason pay respond complet questionnair repres small cost multipl botnet provid invalid respons set ultim reduc studi valid increas research cost techniqu propos detect problemat human respons set research undertaken test extent detect nonhuman respons set propos conduct empir comparison indic assum botnet program base random uniform distribut respons present compar indic studi detect nonhuman respons set sampl human respond mix percentag simul random respons set indic respons coher mahalanobi distanc person total correl estim detect nonhuman respons set indic mahalanobi distanc person total correl calcul easili research work onlin questionnair screen presenc invalid data",0
"KeywordsDecision-making Evidence accumulation models Random number generation Probability density approximation ","a method framework and tutorial for efficiently simulating models of decision making","Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) have become the dominant models of rapid decision-making. Several variants of these models have been proposed, ranging from the simple linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) to the more complex leaky-competing accumulator (LCA), and further extensions that include time-varying rates of evidence accumulation or decision thresholds. Although applications of the simpler variants have been widespread, applications of the more complex models have been fewer, largely due to their intractable likelihood function and the computational cost of mass simulation. Here, I present a framework for efficiently fitting complex EAMs, which uses a new, efficient method of simulating these models. I find that the majority of simulation time is taken up by random number generation (RNG) from the normal distribution, needed for the stochastic noise of the differential equation. To reduce this inefficiency, I propose using the well-known concept within computer science of “look-up tables” (LUTs) as an approximation to the inverse cumulative density function (iCDF) method of RNG, which I call “LUT-iCDF”. I show that when using an appropriately sized LUT, simulations using LUT-iCDF closely match those from the standard RNG method in R. My framework, which I provide a detailed tutorial on how to implement, includes C code for 12 different variants of EAMs using the LUT-iCDF method, and should make the implementation of complex EAMs easier and faster.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","decis make evid accumul model random number generat probabl densiti approxim method framework tutori effici simul model decis make evid accumul model eam domin model rapid decis make variant model propos rang simpl linear ballist accumul lba complex leaki compet accumul lca extens includ time vari rate evid accumul decis threshold applic simpler variant widespread applic complex model fewer larg due intract likelihood function comput cost mass simul present framework effici fit complex eam effici method simul model find major simul time random number generat rng normal distribut need stochast nois differenti equat reduc ineffici propos concept comput scienc tabl lut approxim invers cumul densiti function icdf method rng call lut icdf show appropri size lut simul lut icdf close match standard rng method framework provid detail tutori implement includ code variant eam lut icdf method make implement complex eam easier faster",0
"KeywordsEye movements Event detection Deep learning Fixation Saccade PSO ","gazenet end to end eye movement event detection with deep neural networks","Existing event detection algorithms for eye-movement data almost exclusively rely on thresholding one or more hand-crafted signal features, each computed from the stream of raw gaze data. Moreover, this thresholding is largely left for the end user. Here we present and develop gazeNet, a new framework for creating event detectors that do not require hand-crafted signal features or signal thresholding. It employs an end-to-end deep learning approach, which takes raw eye-tracking data as input and classifies it into fixations, saccades and post-saccadic oscillations. Our method thereby challenges an established tacit assumption that hand-crafted features are necessary in the design of event detection algorithms. The downside of the deep learning approach is that a large amount of training data is required. We therefore first develop a method to augment hand-coded data, so that we can strongly enlarge the data set used for training, minimizing the time spent on manual coding. Using this extended hand-coded data, we train a neural network that produces eye-movement event classification from raw eye-movement data without requiring any predefined feature extraction or post-processing steps. The resulting classification performance is at the level of expert human coders. Moreover, an evaluation of gazeNet on two other datasets showed that gazeNet generalized to data from different eye trackers and consistently outperformed several other event detection algorithms that we tested.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","eye movement event detect deep learn fixat saccad pso gazenet end end eye movement event detect deep neural network exist event detect algorithm eye movement data exclus reli threshold hand craft signal featur comput stream raw gaze data threshold larg left end user present develop gazenet framework creat event detector requir hand craft signal featur signal threshold employ end end deep learn approach take raw eye track data input classifi fixat saccad post saccad oscil method challeng establish tacit assumpt hand craft featur design event detect algorithm downsid deep learn approach larg amount train data requir develop method augment hand code data strong enlarg data set train minim time spent manual code extend hand code data train neural network produc eye movement event classif raw eye movement data requir predefin featur extract post process step result classif perform level expert human coder evalu gazenet dataset show gazenet general data eye tracker consist outperform event detect algorithm test",0
"KeywordsGroup communication analysis Social roles Group interaction Computational linguistics ","group communication analysis a computational linguistics approach for detecting sociocognitive roles in multiparty interactions","Roles are one of the most important concepts in understanding human sociocognitive behavior. During group interactions, members take on different roles within the discussion. Roles have distinct patterns of behavioral engagement (i.e., active or passive, leading or following), contribution characteristics (i.e., providing new information or echoing given material), and social orientation (i.e., individual or group). Different combinations of roles can produce characteristically different group outcomes, and thus can be either less or more productive with regard to collective goals. In online collaborative-learning environments, this can lead to better or worse learning outcomes for the individual participants. In this study, we propose and validate a novel approach for detecting emergent roles from participants’ contributions and patterns of interaction. Specifically, we developed a group communication analysis (GCA) by combining automated computational linguistic techniques with analyses of the sequential interactions of online group communication. GCA was applied to three large collaborative interaction datasets (participant N = 2,429, group N = 3,598). Cluster analyses and linear mixed-effects modeling were used to assess the validity of the GCA approach and the influence of learner roles on student and group performance. The results indicated that participants’ patterns of linguistic coordination and cohesion are representative of the roles that individuals play in collaborative discussions. More broadly, GCA provides a framework for researchers to explore the micro intra- and interpersonal patterns associated with participants’ roles and the sociocognitive processes related to successful collaboration.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","group communic analysi social role group interact comput linguist group communic analysi comput linguist approach detect sociocognit role multiparti interact role import concept understand human sociocognit behavior group interact member role discuss role distinct pattern behavior engag activ passiv lead contribut characterist provid inform echo materi social orient individu group combin role produc characterist group outcom product regard collect goal onlin collabor learn environ lead wors learn outcom individu particip studi propos valid approach detect emerg role particip contribut pattern interact specif develop group communic analysi gca combin autom comput linguist techniqu analys sequenti interact onlin group communic gca appli larg collabor interact dataset particip group cluster analys linear mix effect model assess valid gca approach influenc learner role student group perform result particip pattern linguist coordin cohes repres role individu play collabor discuss broad gca framework research explor micro intra interperson pattern particip role sociocognit process relat success collabor",0

Using comments on the popular social media platform Reddit from January 2006 until September 2017, we showed how changes in the framing of same-sex marriage in public discourse relate to changes in public opinion. We used a topic model to show that the contributions of certain protected-values-based topics to the debate (religious arguments and freedom of opinion) increased prior to the emergence of a public consensus in support of same-sex marriage (Gallup, 2017), and declined afterward. In contrast, the discussion of certain consequentialist topics (the impact of politicians’ stance and same-sex marriage as a matter of policy) showed the opposite pattern.

It is unclear, however, how to statistically quantify the amount of signal present in CIs, which limits the interpretability of these images. In this article, we propose a novel metric, infoVal, which assesses informational value relative to a resampled random distribution and can be interpreted like a z score. In the first part, we define the infoVal metric and show, through simulations, that it adheres to typical Type I error rates under various task conditions (internal validity). In the second part, we show that the metric correlates with markers of data quality in empirical reverse-correlation data, such as the subjective recognizability, objective discriminability, and test–retest reliability of the CIs (convergent validity). In the final part, we demonstrate how the infoVal metric can be used to compare the informational value of reverse-correlation datasets, by comparing data acquired online with data acquired in a controlled lab environment. We recommend a new standard of good practice in which researchers assess the infoVal scores of reverse-correlation data in order to ensure that they do not read signal in CIs where no signal is present.

"KeywordsCorpus statistics Big data Semantic change Representation Phonesthemes ","taming big data applying the experimental method to naturalistic data sets","Psychological researchers have traditionally focused on lab-based experiments to test their theories and hypotheses. Although the lab provides excellent facilities for controlled testing, some questions are best explored by collecting information that is difficult to obtain in the lab. The vast amounts of data now available to researchers can be a valuable resource in this respect. By incorporating this new realm of data and translating it into traditional laboratory methods, we can expand the reach of the lab into the wilderness of human society. This study demonstrates how the troves of linguistic data generated by humans can be used to test theories about cognition and representation. It also suggests how similar interpretations can be made of other research in cognition. The first case tests a long-standing prediction of Gentner’s natural partition hypothesis: that verb meaning is more subject to change due to the textual context in which it appears than is the meaning of nouns. Within a diachronic corpus, verbs and other relational words indeed showed more evidence of semantic change than did concrete nouns. In the second case, corpus statistics were employed to empirically support the existence of phonesthemes—nonmorphemic units of sound that are associated with aspects of meaning. A third study also supported this measure, by demonstrating that it corresponds with performance in a lab experiment.

Along with versioned infrastructure that facilitates reproducibility of past analyses, these interfaces lower barriers to analyzing naturalistic parent–child language, allowing for a wider range of researchers in language and cognitive development to easily leverage CHILDES in their work.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes","child languag corpus linguist reproduc packag research softwar child db flexibl reproduc interfac child languag data exchang system child languag data exchang system child play critic role research child languag develop character earli languag learn environ access data complex novic difficult autom advanc user address issu introduc child db databas format mirror child improv data access usabl offer interfac includ browsabl web applic applic program interfac api version infrastructur facilit reproduc past analys interfac lower barrier analyz naturalist parent child languag allow wider rang research languag cognit develop easili leverag child work",1

"KeywordsConceptual recurrence analysis Text analysis Semantic similarity Semantic coordination Team communication Interpersonal communication ","beyond frequency counts novel conceptual recurrence analysis metrics to index semantic coordination in team communications","Semantic alignment is a key process underlying interpersonal and team communication. However, semantic similarity is difficult to quantify, and statistical approaches designed to measure it often rely on methods that make the identification of the relative importance of key words difficult. This study outlines how conceptual recurrence analysis (CRA) can address these issues and can be used to detect conceptual structure in interpersonal communication. We developed several novel CRA metrics to analyze communication data reported previously by Mancuso, Finomore, Rahill, Blair, and Funke (Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 58, 405–409, 2014), gathered from teams who worked cooperatively on a logic puzzle under different cognitive biasing contexts. CRA, like other measures of semantic coordination, relies on parameters whose values affect estimates of semantic alignment. We evaluated how the dimensionality of semantic spaces affects metrics quantifying the conceptual similarity of communicative exchanges, and whether metrics calculated from top-down, a priori semantic spaces or bottom-up semantic spaces empirically derived from each data set were more sensitive to biasing context. We found that the novel CRA measures were sensitive to manipulations of cognitive bias, and that higher-dimensional, bottom-up semantic spaces generally yielded more sensitivity to the experimental manipulations, though when the communication was evaluated with respect to specific key concepts, lower-dimensional, top-down spaces performed nearly as well. We conclude that CRA is sensitive to experimental manipulations in ways consistent with prior findings and that it presents a customizable framework for testing predictions about interpersonal communication patterns and other linguistic exchanges.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","conceptu recurr analysi text analysi semant similar semant coordin team communic interperson communic frequenc count conceptu recurr analysi metric index semant coordin team communic semant align key process under interperson team communic semant similar difficult quantifi statist approach design measur reli method make identif relat import key word difficult studi outlin conceptu recurr analysi cra address issu detect conceptu structur interperson communic develop cra metric analyz communic data report previous mancuso finomor rahil blair funk proceed human factor ergonom societi annual meet gather team work cooper logic puzzl cognit bias context cra measur semant coordin reli paramet valu affect estim semant align evalu dimension semant space affect metric quantifi conceptu similar communic exchang metric calcul top priori semant space bottom semant space empir deriv data set sensit bias context found cra measur sensit manipul cognit bias higher dimension bottom semant space general yield sensit experiment manipul communic evalu respect specif key concept lower dimension top space perform conclud cra sensit experiment manipul way consist prior find present customiz framework test predict interperson communic pattern linguist exchang",0
"KeywordsMethodological innovation Text analysis Continuous representations Intent recognition ","measuring the importance of context when modeling language comprehension","It is widely accepted that language requires context in order to function as communication between speakers and listeners. As listeners, we make use of background knowledge — about the speaker, about entities and concepts, about previous utterances — in order to infer the speaker’s intended meaning. But even if there is consensus that these sources of information are a necessary component of linguistic communication, it is another matter entirely to provide a thorough, quantitative accounting for context’s interaction with language. When does context matter? What kinds of context matter in which kinds of domains? The empirical investigation of these questions is inhibited by a number of factors: the challenge of quantifying language, the boundless combinations of domains and types of context to be measured, and the challenge of selecting and applying a given construct to natural language data. In response to these factors, we introduce and demonstrate a methodological framework for testing the importance of contextual information in inferring speaker intentions from text. We apply Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks, a standard for representing language in its natural, sequential state, and conduct a set of experiments for predicting the persuasive intentions of speakers in political debates using different combinations of text and background information about the speaker. We show, in our modeling and discussion, that the proposed framework is suitable for empirically evaluating the manner and magnitude of context’s relevance for any number of domains and constructs.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","methodolog innov text analysi continu represent intent recognit measur import context model languag comprehens wide accept languag requir context order function communic speaker listen listen make background knowledg speaker entiti concept previous utter order infer speaker intend mean consensus sourc inform compon linguist communic matter provid quantit account context interact languag context matter kind context matter kind domain empir investig question inhibit number factor challeng quantifi languag boundless combin domain type context measur challeng select appli construct natur languag data respons factor introduc demonstr methodolog framework test import contextu inform infer speaker intent text appli long short term memori lstm network standard repres languag natur sequenti state conduct set experi predict persuas intent speaker polit debat combin text background inform speaker show model discuss propos framework suitabl empir evalu manner magnitud context relev number domain construct",0
"KeywordsConceptual knowledge Conceptual flexibility Network science ","implementing a concept network model","The same concept can mean different things or be instantiated in different forms, depending on context, suggesting a degree of flexibility within the conceptual system. We propose that a feature-based network model can be used to capture and predict this flexibility. We modeled individual concepts (e.g., banana, bottle) as graph-theoretical networks, in which properties (e.g., yellow, sweet) were represented as nodes and their associations as edges. In this framework, networks capture within-concept statistics that reflect how properties relate to one another across instances of a concept. We extracted formal measures of these networks that capture different aspects of network structure, and explored whether a concept’s network structure relates to its flexibility of use. To do so, we compared network measures to a text-based measure of semantic diversity, as well as to empirical data from a figurative-language task and an alternative-uses task. We found that network-based measures were predictive of the text-based and empirical measures of flexible concept use, highlighting the ability of this approach to formally capture relevant characteristics of conceptual structure. Conceptual flexibility is a fundamental attribute of the cognitive and semantic systems, and in this proof of concept we reveal that variations in concept representation and use can be formally understood in terms of the informational content and topology of concept networks.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","conceptu knowledg conceptu flexibl network scienc implement concept network model concept thing instanti form depend context suggest degre flexibl conceptu system propos featur base network model captur predict flexibl model individu concept banana bottl graph theoret network properti yellow sweet repres node associ edg framework network captur concept statist reflect properti relat instanc concept extract formal measur network captur aspect network structur explor concept network structur relat flexibl compar network measur text base measur semant divers empir data figur languag task altern task found network base measur predict text base empir measur flexibl concept highlight abil approach formal captur relev characterist conceptu structur conceptu flexibl fundament attribut cognit semant system proof concept reveal variat concept represent formal understood term inform content topolog concept network",0
"KeywordsMental health Machine learning Big data ADHD Anxiety Bipolar Depression ","predicting future mental illness from social media a big data approach","In the present research, we investigated whether people’s everyday language contains sufficient signal to predict the future occurrence of mental illness. Language samples were collected from the social media website Reddit, drawing on posts to discussion groups focusing on different kinds of mental illness (clinical subreddits), as well as on posts to discussion groups focusing on nonmental health topics (nonclinical subreddits). As expected, words drawn from the clinical subreddits could be used to distinguish several kinds of mental illness (ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression). Interestingly, words drawn from the nonclinical subreddits (e.g., travel, cooking, cars) could also be used to distinguish different categories of mental illness, implying that the impact of mental illness spills over into topics unrelated to mental illness. Most importantly, words derived from the nonclinical subreddits predicted future postings to clinical subreddits, implying that everyday language contains signal about the likelihood of future mental illness, possibly before people are aware of their mental health condition. Finally, whereas models trained on clinical subreddits learned to focus on words indicating disorder-specific symptoms, models trained to predict future mental illness learned to focus on words indicating life stress, suggesting that kinds of features that are predictive of mental illness may change over time. Implications for the underlying causes of mental illness are discussed.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","mental health machin learn big data adhd anxieti bipolar depress predict futur mental ill social media big data approach present research investig peopl everyday languag suffici signal predict futur occurr mental ill languag sampl collect social media websit reddit draw post discuss group focus kind mental ill clinic subreddit post discuss group focus nonment health topic nonclin subreddit expect word drawn clinic subreddit distinguish kind mental ill adhd anxieti bipolar disord depress interest word drawn nonclin subreddit travel cook car distinguish categori mental ill impli impact mental ill spill topic unrel mental ill import word deriv nonclin subreddit predict futur post clinic subreddit impli everyday languag signal likelihood futur mental ill possibl peopl awar mental health condit final model train clinic subreddit learn focus word indic disord specif symptom model train predict futur mental ill learn focus word indic life stress suggest kind featur predict mental ill chang time implic under mental ill discuss",0

The positive pole of the associations was gathered around the concept of “Refugees” who need help, whereas the negative pole associated asylum seekers with “Violence.” The results were relatively consistent in the two independent samples.

"KeywordsMeasurement of facial movement Emotion expression Optical measurement Video data analysis Open-source software ","the blenderface method video based measurement of raw movement data during facial expressions of emotion using open source software","This article proposes an optical measurement of movement applied to data from video recordings of facial expressions of emotion. The approach offers a way to capture motion adapted from the film industry in which markers placed on the skin of the face can be tracked with a pattern-matching algorithm. The method records and postprocesses raw facial movement data (coordinates per frame) of distinctly placed markers and is intended for use in facial expression research (e.g., microexpressions) in laboratory settings. Due to the explicit use of specifically placed, artificial markers, the procedure offers the simultaneous measurement of several emotionally relevant markers in a (psychometrically) objective and artifact-free way, even for facial regions without natural landmarks (e.g., the cheeks). In addition, the proposed procedure is fully based on open-source software and is transparent at every step of data processing. Two worked examples demonstrate the practicability of the proposed procedure: In Study 1(N= 39), the participants were instructed to show the emotions happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger, and in Study 2 (N= 113), they were asked to present both a neutral face and the emotions happiness, disgust, and fear. Study 2 involved the simultaneous tracking of 14 markers for approximately 12 min per participant with a time resolution of 33 ms. The measured facial movements corresponded closely to the assumptions of established measurement instruments (EMFACS, FACSAID, Friesen & Ekman, 1983; Ekman & Hager, 2002). In addition, the measurement was found to be very precise with sub-second, sub-pixel, and sub-millimeter accuracy.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","measur facial movement emot express optic measur video data analysi open sourc softwar blenderfac method video base measur raw movement data facial express emot open sourc softwar articl propos optic measur movement appli data video record facial express emot approach offer captur motion adapt film industri marker skin face track pattern match algorithm method record postprocess raw facial movement data coordin frame distinct marker intend facial express research microexpress laboratori set due explicit specif artifici marker procedur offer simultan measur emot relev marker psychometr object artifact free facial region natur landmark cheek addit propos procedur fulli base open sourc softwar transpar step data process work exampl demonstr practic propos procedur studi particip instruct show emot happi sad disgust anger studi ask present neutral face emot happi disgust fear studi involv simultan track marker approxim min particip time resolut ms measur facial movement correspond close assumpt establish measur instrument emfac facsaid friesen ekman ekman hager addit measur found precis pixel millimet accuraci",0
"KeywordsDatabase Chinese Radicals Logographemes ","validation of constituent logographemes and radicals in chinese characters using handwriting data","Studies have shown that logographemes and radicals, subcharacter units in Chinese characters, are represented in the orthographic lexicon and are functional processing units in the writing of Chinese characters. Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding how characters should be segmented into logographemes and radicals. This article reports handwriting data for a list of 209 Chinese characters (95 nonphonetic compounds and 114 phonetic compounds) in a copying task. To validate the constituent logographemes and radicals of the target Chinese characters, comparisons among between-radical interstroke intervals (ISIs), between-logographeme ISIs, and within-logographeme ISIs, as well as their interactions with orthographic factors including character frequency, stroke number, and configuration, were conducted using factorial analyses. The results showed that the ISI comparison method is effective in validating the constituent logographemes and radicals in Chinese characters. On the basis of this list of 209 stimuli, another 1,227 Chinese characters that share the same set of radicals with the stimuli were further identified. Their constituent logographemes were deduced accordingly. Altogether, the over 1,000 Chinese characters with validated constituent logographemes will serve as a powerful reference for future psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research.

"KeywordsAutobiographical memory Text mining Natural language processing ","autobiographical recall of personally familiar names and temporal information in e mails an automatic analytic approach using e mail communications","An important question that arises from autobiographical memory research is whether the variables that influence memory in the laboratory also drive memory for autobiographical episodes in real life. We explored this question within the context of e-mail communications and investigated the variables that influence recall for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails. We designed a Web-based program that analyzed each participant’s year-old sent e-mail archive and applied textual analysis algorithms to identify a set of sentences likely to be memorable. These sentences were then used as the stimuli in a cued recall task. Participants saw two sentences from their sent e-mail as a cue and attempted to recall the name of the e-mail recipient. Participants also rated the vividness of recall for the e-mail conversation and estimated the month in which they had written the e-mail. Linear mixed-effect analyses revealed that recipient name recall accuracy decreased with longer retention intervals and increased with greater frequency of contact with the recipient. Also, with longer retention intervals, participants dated e-mails as being more recent than their actual month. This telescoping error was moderately larger for e-mails with greater sentiment. These findings suggest that memory for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails closely follows the patterns for autobiographical memory and proper-name recall found in laboratory settings.

Subjects are asked to create a full soundscape by means of a dedicated software tool, coupled with a structured sound data set. This paradigm is used to characterize urban sound environment representations by analyzing the sound classes that were used to simulate the auditory scenes. A rating experiment of the soundscape pleasantness using a seven-point bipolar semantic scale is conducted to further refine the analysis of the simulated urban acoustic scenes. Results show that (1) a semantic characterization in terms of presence/absence of sound sources is an effective way to characterize urban soundscape pleasantness, and (2) acoustic pressure levels computed for specific sound sources better characterize the appraisal than the acoustic pressure level computed over the overall soundscape.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","cognit psycholog soundscap percept soundscap simul investig percept soundscap acoust scene simul paper introduc experiment protocol studi mental represent urban soundscap simul process subject ask creat full soundscap mean dedic softwar tool coupl structur sound data set paradigm character urban sound environ represent analyz sound class simul auditori scene rate experi soundscap pleasant point bipolar semant scale conduct refin analysi simul urban acoust scene result show semant character term presenceabs sound sourc effect character urban soundscap pleasant acoust pressur level comput specif sound sourc character apprais acoust pressur level comput soundscap",0
"KeywordsMind wandering Task-unrelated thought Eye movements Reading ","do your eyes give you away a validation study of eye movement measures used as indicators for mindless reading","Identifying eye-movement measures as objective indicators of mind wandering seems to be a work in progress. We reviewed research comparing eye movements during self-categorized episodes of normal versus mindless reading and found little consensus regarding the specific measures that are sensitive to attentional decoupling during mind wandering. To address this issue of inconsistency, we conducted a new, high-powered eye-tracking experiment and considered all previously identified mind-wandering indicators. In our experiment, only three measures (reading time, fixation count, and first-fixation duration) positively predicted self-categorized mindless reading. Aside from these single measures, the word-frequency effect was found to be generally less pronounced during mindless-reading than during normal-reading episodes. To additionally test for convergent validity between the objective and subjective mind-wandering measures, we utilized eye-movement measures as well as thought reports, to examine the effect of metacognitive awareness on mind-wandering behavior. We expected that participants anticipating a difficult comprehension test would mind wander less during reading than would those anticipating an easy test. Although we were able to induce metacognitive expectancies about task difficulty, we found no evidence that these difficulty expectancies affected either subjectively reported or objectively measured mind wandering.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No","mind wander task unrel thought eye movement read eye give valid studi eye movement measur indic mindless read identifi eye movement measur object indic mind wander work progress review research compar eye movement categor episod normal versus mindless read found consensus specif measur sensit attent decoupl mind wander address issu inconsist conduct high power eye track experi consid previous identifi mind wander indic experi measur read time fixat count fixat durat posit predict categor mindless read singl measur word frequenc effect found general pronounc mindless read normal read episod addit test converg valid object subject mind wander measur util eye movement measur thought report examin effect metacognit awar mind wander behavior expect particip anticip difficult comprehens test mind wander read anticip easi test induc metacognit expect task difficulti found evid difficulti expect affect subject report object measur mind wander",0

Although many text-to-speech systems are available, researchers of human nonverbal vocalizations and bioacousticians may profit from a dedicated simple tool for synthesizing and manipulating natural-sounding vocalizations. Soundgen (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=soundgen) is an open-source R package that synthesizes nonverbal vocalizations based on meaningful acoustic parameters, which can be specified from the command line or in an interactive app. This tool was validated by comparing the perceived emotion, valence, arousal, and authenticity of 60 recorded human nonverbal vocalizations (screams, moans, laughs, and so on) and their approximate synthetic reproductions. Each synthetic sound was created by manually specifying only a small number of high-level control parameters, such as syllable length and a few anchors for the intonation contour. Nevertheless, the valence and arousal ratings of synthetic sounds were similar to those of the original recordings, and the authenticity ratings were comparable, maintaining parity with the originals for less complex vocalizations. Manipulating the precise acoustic characteristics of synthetic sounds may shed light on the salient predictors of emotion in the human voice. More generally, soundgen may prove useful for any studies that require precise control over the acoustic features of nonspeech sounds, including research on animal vocalizations and auditory perception.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes","anim vocalizationsemotionform synthesisnonverb vocalizationsopen sourceparametr synthesisvoic synthesi soundgen open sourc tool synthes nonverb vocal abstract voic synthesi method investig communic role acoust featur text speech system research human nonverb vocal bioacoustician profit dedic simpl tool synthes manipul natur sound vocal soundgen httpscran projectorgpackagesoundgen open sourc packag synthes nonverb vocal base meaning acoust paramet command line interact app tool valid compar perceiv emot valenc arous authent record human nonverb vocal scream moan laugh approxim synthet reproduct synthet sound creat manual small number high level control paramet syllabl length anchor inton contour valenc arous rate synthet sound similar origin record authent rate compar maintain pariti origin complex vocal manipul precis acoust characterist synthet sound shed light salient predictor emot human voic general soundgen prove studi requir precis control acoust featur nonspeech sound includ research anim vocal auditori percept",1
