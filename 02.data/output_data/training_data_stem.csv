"KeywordsLexical database Mandarin Chinese Simplified Chinese Chinese lexical database CLD ","chinese lexical database cld","We present the Chinese Lexical Database (CLD): a large-scale lexical database for simplified Chinese. The CLD provides a wealth of lexical information for 3913 one-character words, 34,233 two-character words, 7143 three-character words, and 3355 four-character words, and is publicly available through http://www.chineselexicaldatabase.com. For each of the 48,644 words in the CLD, we provide a wide range of categorical predictors, as well as an extensive set of frequency measures, complexity measures, neighborhood density measures, orthography-phonology consistency measures, and information-theoretic measures. We evaluate the explanatory power of the lexical variables in the CLD in the context of experimental data through analyses of lexical decision latencies for one-character, two-character, three-character and four-character words, as well as word naming latencies for one-character and two-character words. The results of these analyses are discussed.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","lexic databas mandarin chines simplifi chines chines lexic databas cld chines lexic databas cld present chines lexic databas cld larg scale lexic databas simplifi chines cld wealth lexic inform charact word charact word charact word charact word public httpwwwchineselexicaldatabas word cld provid wide rang categor predictor extens set frequenc measur complex measur neighborhood densiti measur orthographi phonolog consist measur inform theoret measur evalu explanatori power lexic variabl cld context experiment data analys lexic decis latenc charact charact charact charact word word name latenc charact charact word result analys discuss",0

"KeywordsImplicit Memory Primed Word Word Fragment Priming Index Stem Completion ","priming index of the spanish word fragments from the das soler and ruiz 2004 database","Word-fragment completion is a frequently used test in implicit memory research. A database of 196 Spanish fragments was recently published (Dasí, Soler, & Ruiz, 2004) in which the fragments were described for indices, such as difficulty, familiarity, frequency, number of meanings, and so on (www.psychonomic.org/archive). In this work, a new index, thepriming index, is described for the same 196 fragments. This index is calculated for each fragment by subtracting the difficulty index (the proportion of correct completion when the fragment is not studied) from the proportion of correct completion when the fragment is studied, and it means the capacity of an item to be primed. In order to determine whether the new index performs well, we have replicated some important experimental effects, such as priming, frequency, and difficulty. We consider that this index can help researchers to better select stimuli for fragment-completion tasks.","Behavior Research Methods",2007,"No","implicit memori prime word word fragment prime index stem complet prime index spanish word fragment das soler ruiz databas word fragment complet frequent test implicit memori research databas spanish fragment recent publish das soler ruiz fragment indic difficulti familiar frequenc number mean wwwpsychonomicorgarch work index theprim index fragment index calcul fragment subtract difficulti index proport correct complet fragment studi proport correct complet fragment studi mean capac item prime order determin index perform replic import experiment effect prime frequenc difficulti index research select stimuli fragment complet task",0

The corpora contained in the DGD2 come from a variety of sources, some of them in-house projects, some of them external projects. Most of the corpora were originally intended either for research into the (dialectal) variation of German or for studies in conversation analysis and related fields. The AGD has taken over the task of permanently archiving these resources and making them available for reuse to the research community. To date, the DGD2 offers access to 19 different corpora, totalling around 9000 speech events, 2500 hours of audio recordings or 8 million transcribed words.

NA,"the design of a corpus of contemporary arabic","Corpora are an important resource for both teaching and research. Arabic lacks sufficient resources in this field, so a research project has been designed to compile a corpus, which represents the state of the Arabic language at the present time and the needs of end-users. This report presents the result of a survey of the needs of teachers of Arabic as a foreign language (TAFL) and language engineers. The survey shows that a wide range of text types should be included in the corpus. Overall, our survey confirms our view that existing corpora are too narrowly limited in source-type and genre, and that there is a need for a freely-accessible corpus of contemporary Arabic covering a broad range of text-types. We have collected and published an initial version of the Corpus of Contemporary Arabic (CCA) to meet these design issues. The CCA is freely downloadable via WWW from http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/arabic.","International Journal of Corpus Linguistics",2006,"Yes","design corpus contemporari arab corpora import resourc teach research arab lack suffici resourc field research project design compil corpus repres state arab languag present time end user report present result survey teacher arab foreign languag tafl languag engin survey show wide rang text type includ corpus survey confirm view exist corpora narrowli limit sourc type genr freeli access corpus contemporari arab cover broad rang text type collect publish initi version corpus contemporari arab cca meet design issu cca freeli download www httpwwwcompleedsacukarab",1
"gloss analysis,lexical resources,opinion mining,sentiment classification,supervised learning","sentiwordnet a high coverage lexical resource for opinion mining","Opinion mining (OM) is a recent subdiscipline at the crossroads of information retrieval and computational linguistics which is concerned not with the topic a document is about, but with the opinions it expresses. OM has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users' opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. In order to aid the extraction of opinions from text, recent research has tried to automatically determine the “PN-polarity” of subjective terms, i.e. identify whether a term that indicates the presence of an opinion has a positive or a negative connotation. Research on determining the “SO-polarity” of terms, i.e. whether a term indeed indicates the presence of an opinion (a subjective term) or not (an objective, or neutral term) has been instead much scarcer. In this paper we describe SentiWordNet, a lexical resource produced by asking an automated classifier ˆ to associate to each synset s of WordNet (version 2.0) a triplet of scores ˆ(s, p) (for p 2 P ={\{}Positive, Negative, Objective{\}}) describing how strongly the terms contained in s enjoy each of the three properties. The method used to develop SentiWordNet is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses associated to synsets, and on the use of the resulting vectorial term representations for semi-supervised synset classification. The score triplet is derived by combining the results produced by a committee of eight ternary classifiers, all characterized by similar accuracy levels but extremely different classification behaviour. We present the results of evaluating the accuracy of the automatically assigned triplets on a publicly available benchmark. SentiWordNet is freely available for research purposes, and is endowed with a Web-based graphical user interface.","Evaluation",2007,"Yes","gloss analysislex resourcesopinion miningsenti classificationsupervis learn sentiwordnet high coverag lexic resourc opinion mine opinion mine om recent subdisciplin crossroad inform retriev comput linguist concern topic document opinion express om rich set applic rang track user opinion product polit candid express onlin forum custom relationship manag order aid extract opinion text recent research automat determin pn polar subject term identifi term presenc opinion posit negat connot research determin polar term term presenc opinion subject term object neutral term scarcer paper describ sentiwordnet lexic resourc produc autom classifi associ synset wordnet version triplet score posit negat object describ strong term contain enjoy properti method develop sentiwordnet base quantit analysi gloss synset result vectori term represent semi supervis synset classif score triplet deriv combin result produc committe ternari classifi character similar accuraci level extrem classif behaviour present result evalu accuraci automat assign triplet public benchmark sentiwordnet freeli research purpos endow web base graphic user interfac",1
NA,"spoken word frequency counts based on 16 million words in american english","Written word frequency (e.g., Francis {\&} Kucera, 1982; Kucera {\&} Francis, 1967) constitutes a popular measure of word familiarity, which is highly predictive of word recognition. Far less often, researchers employ spoken frequency counts in their studies. This discrepancy can be attributed most readily to the conspicuous absence of a sizeable spoken frequency count for American English. The present article reports the construction of a 1.6-million-word spoken frequency database derived from the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (Simpson, Swales, {\&} Briggs, 2002). We generated spoken frequency counts for 34,922 words and extracted speaker attributes from the source material to generate relative frequencies of words spoken by each speaker category.

NA,"bank of standardized stimuli boss updated 1420 normative photos of various concepts to be used in cognitive science","In cognitive science, results are obtained following the manipulation of one stimulus' variable and the control of potential confounding variables. To avoid the tedious task of measuring confounding effects, scientists often refer to normative sets of stimuli. The Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS) is one of these sets. It initially included 480 normative stimuli of common objects and norms for seven variables (name, category, familiarity, visual complexity, object's typicality, manipulability and orientation). The BOSS has expanded and provides a wider variety of stimuli in order to fulfill the needs of experiments. To date, the latest version of the BOSS is comprised of 1,420 normative stimuli, including photos of animals, and new norms (color diagnositicity, symmetry, and action related norms). In order to demonstrate the influence of normative variables on cognitions, experiments on episodic memory were completed using the BOSS. Analyses were conducted as a function of the norms and indicated that name agreement, visual complexity, object/viewpoint agreement, symmetry, and color diagnosticity all influenced memory in distinct ways mostly by affecting the performance to new stimuli and by inducing response biases.","PsycEXTRA Dataset",2013,"Yes","bank standard stimuli boss updat normat photo concept cognit scienc cognit scienc result obtain manipul stimulus variabl control potenti confound variabl avoid tedious task measur confound effect scientist refer normat set stimuli bank standard stimuli boss set initi includ normat stimuli common object norm variabl categori familiar visual complex object typic manipul orient boss expand wider varieti stimuli order fulfil experi date latest version boss compris normat stimuli includ photo anim norm color diagnosit symmetri action relat norm order demonstr influenc normat variabl cognit experi episod memori complet boss analys conduct function norm agreement visual complex objectviewpoint agreement symmetri color diagnost influenc memori distinct way affect perform stimuli induc respons bias",1

However, no ratings for older adults are available. The aim of the present study was to close this gap by providing ratings of valence and arousal for 504 IAPS pictures by 53 young and 53 older adults. Both age groups rated positive pictures as less arousing, resulting in a stronger linear association between valence and arousal, than has been found in previous studies. This association was even stronger in older than in young adults. Older adults perceived negative pictures as more negative and more arousing and positive pictures as more positive and less arousing than young adults did. This might indicate a dedifferentiation of emotional processing in old age. On the basis of a picture recognition task, we also report memorability scores for individual pictures and how they relate to valence and arousal ratings.

NA,"age of acquisition and imageability norms for base and morphologically complex words in english and in spanish","The extent to which processing words involves breaking them down into smaller units or morphemes or is the result of an interactive activation of other units, such as meanings, letters, and sounds (e.g., dis-agree-ment vs. disagreement), is currently under debate. Disentangling morphology from phonology and semantics is often a methodological challenge, because orthogonal manipulations are difficult to achieve (e.g., semantically unrelated words are often phonologically related: casual-casualty and, vice versa, sign-signal). The present norms provide a morphological classification of 3,263 suffixed derived words from two widely spoken languages: English (2,204 words) and Spanish (1,059 words). Morphologically complex words were sorted into four categories according to the nature of their relationship with the base word: phonologically transparent (friend-friendly), phonologically opaque (child-children), semantically transparent (habit-habitual), and semantically opaque (event-eventual). In addition, ratings were gathered for age of acquisition, imageability, and semantic distance (i.e., the extent to which the meaning of the complex derived form could be drawn from the meaning of its base constituents). The norms were completed by adding values for word frequency; word length in number of phonemes, letters, and syllables; lexical similarity, as measured by the number of neighbors; and morphological family size. A series of comparative analyses from the collated ratings for the base and derived words were also carried out. The results are discussed in relation to recent findings.","Behavior Research Methods",2016,"Yes","age acquisit imag norm base morpholog complex word english spanish extent process word involv break smaller unit morphem result interact activ unit mean letter sound dis agre ment disagr debat disentangl morpholog phonolog semant methodolog challeng orthogon manipul difficult achiev semant unrel word phonolog relat casual casualti vice versa sign signal present norm provid morpholog classif suffix deriv word wide spoken languag english word spanish word morpholog complex word sort categori natur relationship base word phonolog transpar friend friend phonolog opaqu child children semant transpar habit habitu semant opaqu event eventu addit rate gather age acquisit imag semant distanc extent mean complex deriv form drawn mean base constitu norm complet ad valu word frequenc word length number phonem letter syllabl lexic similar measur number neighbor morpholog famili size seri compar analys collat rate base deriv word carri result discuss relat recent find",1

"Lexical decision,Megastudies,Orthographic priming,Visual word recognition","a behavioral database for masked form priming","Reading involves a process of matching an orthographic input with stored representations in lexical memory. The masked priming paradigm has become a standard tool for investigating this process. Use of existing results from this paradigm can be limited by the precision of the data and the need for cross-experiment comparisons that lack normal experimental controls. Here, we present a single, large, high-precision, multicondition experiment to address these problems. Over 1,000 participants from 14 sites responded to 840 trials involving 28 different types of orthographically related primes (e.g., castfe-CASTLE) in a lexical decision task, as well as completing measures of spelling and vocabulary. The data were indeed highly sensitive to differences between conditions: After correction for multiple comparisons, prime type condition differences of 2.90 ms and above reached significance at the 5{\%} level. This article presents the method of data collection and preliminary findings from these data, which included replications of the most widely agreed-upon differences between prime types, further evidence for systematic individual differences in susceptibility to priming, and new evidence regarding lexical properties associated with a target word's susceptibility to priming. These analyses will form a basis for the use of these data in quantitative model fitting and evaluation and for future exploration of these data that will inform and motivate new experiments.","Behavior Research Methods",2014,"Yes","lexic decisionmegastudiesorthograph primingvisu word recognit behavior databas mask form prime read involv process match orthograph input store represent lexic memori mask prime paradigm standard tool investig process exist result paradigm limit precis data cross experi comparison lack normal experiment control present singl larg high precis multicondit experi address problem particip site respond trial involv type orthograph relat prime castf castl lexic decis task complet measur spell vocabulari data high sensit differ condit correct multipl comparison prime type condit differ ms reach signific level articl present method data collect preliminari find data includ replic wide agre differ prime type evid systemat individu differ suscept prime evid lexic properti target word suscept prime analys form basi data quantit model fit evalu futur explor data inform motiv experi",1
"Body image,Body-only pictures,Computer-generated,Database,Development,Women","a database of body only computer generated pictures of women for body image studies development and preliminary validation","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 49(3) of Behavior Research Methods (see record 2017-21867-030). In the original article, there was an error in the second sentence of Footnote 3 on page 175. The corrected sentence is present in the erratum.] The body-shape-related stimuli used in most body-image studies have several limitations (e.g., a lack of pilot validation procedures and the use of non-body-shape-related control/neutral stimuli). We therefore developed a database of 61 computer-generated body-only pictures of women, wherein bodies were methodically manipulated in terms of fatness versus thinness. Eighty-two young women assessed the pictures' attractiveness, beauty, harmony (valence ratings), and body shape (assessed on a thinness/fatness axis), providing normative data for valence and body shape ratings. First, stimuli manipulated for fatness versus thinness conveyed comparable emotional intensities regarding the valence and body shape ratings. Second, different subcategories of stimuli were obtained on the basis of variations in body shape and valence judgments. Fat and thin bodies were distributed into several subcategories depending on their valence ratings, and a subcategory containing stimuli that were neutral in terms of valence and body shape was identified. Interestingly, at a descriptive level, the thinness/fatness manipulations of the bodies were in a curvilinear relationship with the valence ratings: Thin bodies were not only judged as positive, but also as negative when their estimated body mass indexes (BMIs) decreased too much. Finally, convergent validity was assessed by exploring the impacts of body-image-related variables (BMI, thin-ideal internalization, and body dissatisfaction) on participants' judgments of the bodies. Valence judgments, but not body shape judgments, were influenced by the participants' levels of thin-ideal internalization and body dissatisfaction. Participants' BMIs did not significantly influence their judgments. Given these findings, this database contains relevant material that can be used in various fields, primarily for studies of body-image disturbance or eating disorders.

Much of the evidence for modality-specificity in conceptual processing comes from the property-verification task. When applying this and other tasks, it is important to select items based on their modality-exclusivity. We collected modality ratings for a set of 387 properties, each of which was paired with two different concepts, yielding a total of 774 concept-property items. For each item, participants rated the degree to which the property could be experienced through five perceptual modalities (vision, audition, touch, smell, and taste). Based on these ratings, we computed a measure of modality exclusivity, the degree to which a property is perceived exclusively through one sensory modality. In this paper, we briefly sketch the theoretical background of conceptual knowledge, discuss the use of the property-verification task in cognitive research, provide our norms and statistics, and validate the norms in a memory experiment. We conclude that our norms are important for researchers studying modality-specific effects in conceptual processing.","Behavior Research Methods",2011,"Yes","conceptu knowledgeflex meaningground cognitionmod exclusivityproperti verif task sharp imag sharp knife norm modal exclus concept properti item recent embodi cognit theori mental concept repres modal specif sensori motor system evid modal specif conceptu process properti verif task appli task import select item base modal exclus collect modal rate set properti pair concept yield total concept properti item item particip rate degre properti experienc perceptu modal vision audit touch smell tast base rate comput measur modal exclus degre properti perceiv exclus sensori modal paper briefli sketch theoret background conceptu knowledg discuss properti verif task cognit research provid norm statist valid norm memori experi conclud norm import research studi modal specif effect conceptu process",1

NA,"eurowordnetbuilding a multilingual database with wordnets for several european languages","This book describes the main objective of EuroWordNet, which is the building of a multilingual database with lexical semantic networks or wordnets for several European languages. Each wordnet in the database represents a language-specific structure due to the unique lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are inter-linked via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where equivalent concepts across languages should share the same index item. The flexible multilingual design of the database makes it possible to compare the lexicalizations and semantic structures, revealing answers to fundamental linguistic and philosophical questions which could never be answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic networks across languages, what are the language-specific differences of these networks, is there a language-universal ontology, how much information can be shared across languages? First attempts to answer these questions are given in the form of a set of shared or common Base Concepts that has been derived from the separate wordnets and their classification by a language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts play a fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the database may also serve many practical needs with respect to (cross-language) information retrieval, machine translation tools, language generation tools and language learning tools, which are discussed in the final chapter.

NA,"an object and action naming battery with pairwise matching on various psycholinguistic characteristics","Background: The Object and Action Naming Battery (OANB) was developed by Druks and Masterson in 2000 in response to the lack of materials for investigating the difference between the availability of nouns and verbs. This battery has been extensively used in psycholinguistic and aphasia research. The battery has also proved to be a useful tool in clinical practice by speech and language therapists. Aims: Till date, there are no published aphasia assessment tools specifically developed for the use of Saudi Arabic speakers. Therefore, the present study aimed to adapt the OANB for the use of Saudi Arabic speakers. This paper describes the adaptation process. Methods {\&} Procedures: Name agreement data for the items in the OANB was collected from 30 non-brain-damaged Saudi Arabic-speaking adults. This was followed by collecting values for the psycholinguistic variables available in the original battery, which are spoken-word frequency, imageability, age of acquisition, and visual complexity. Outcomes {\&} Results: The Saudi Arabic version of the OANB consists of 50 object and 50 action pictures with high level of name agreement (100{\%} for object pictures, and at least 93{\%} for action pictures), along with the normative data for the variables of spoken-word frequency, imageability, age of acquisition, and visual complexity of the verbal labels for the object and action pictures included in the Saudi Arabic version of the battery. Conclusions: This battery makes a significant contribution to aphasia resources available in Saudi Arabia as it can be used in clinical settings at the assessment stage and for therapeutic purposes for individuals with aphasia.

NA,"ud phonology lab stress pattern database","Languages with binary stress systems frequently tolerate a stress lapse over the final two syllables, but almost none tolerate a word-initial stress lapse. Lunden (to appear) argues that this lapse asymmetry can be explained by the presence of word-level final lengthening, which can then create the perception of prominence alternation in languages that use duration as stress correlate. The results of a production and a perception study with English speakers are presented which compare /ɑ/s that occur under stress lapse to /ɑ/s in non-stress-lapse positions. While word-final unstressed /ɑ/ is always longer than non-final unstressed /ɑ/, it is significantly longer when immediately following an unstressed syllable. Similarly, unstressed word-final /ɑ/ has a higher F1 and lower F2 than non-final unstressed /ɑ/, but word-finally this less-reduced vowel is closer to a full vowel when the final syllable is part of a stress lapse. The perception study finds that these differences have perceptual consequences that can lead to a perceived continued rhythm in stress lapse. The phonetic differences explain why a word-final unstressed vowel can be perceived as relatively strong when following an unstressed syllable but as relatively weak when following a stressed syllable.",NA,NA,"Yes","ud phonolog lab stress pattern databas languag binari stress system frequent toler stress laps final syllabl toler word initi stress laps lunden argu laps asymmetri explain presenc word level final lengthen creat percept promin altern languag durat stress correl result product percept studi english speaker present compar occur stress laps stress laps posit word final unstress longer final unstress signific longer immedi unstress syllabl similar unstress word final higher f lower f final unstress word final reduc vowel closer full vowel final syllabl part stress laps percept studi find differ perceptu consequ lead perceiv continu rhythm stress laps phonet differ explain word final unstress vowel perceiv strong unstress syllabl weak stress syllabl",1

NA,"thesaurus linguae sericae","TLS explores the conceptual schemes of pre-Buddhist Chinese on the basis of over 8500 A4 pages of text with interlinear translations. TLS is a sustained effort in philological and philosophical fieldwork, designed throughout to make the classical Chinese evidence strictly comparable to that of other cultures, and to make possible meaningful analytic primary-evidence-based disagreement among non-sinologists on classical Chinese concepts and words. TLS is compiled in the hope that careful philosophical reflection on Chinese texts might serve to broaden the empirical basis for philosophical theories and generalisations on conceptual schemes. TLS is based on the conviction that we should improve the clarity and bite of declarations of difference between conceptual schemes by enlarging the basis of literally translated and analysed texts from widely (though never radically) different intellectual cultures. The necessary charitable assumption that if we want to understand others we must count them right in most matters will not prevent TLS from looking for and exploring deep conceptual contrasts to the full. TLS seeks to make precise criteria of translation for classical Chinese, mainly through a detailed description in English of systematic recurrent semantic relations between Chinese words, especially distinctive semantic features. TLS is the first synonym dictionary of classical Chinese in any Western language. TLS focusses on distinctive semantic nuances. TLS is the first interactive dictionary of Chinese. TLS is the first dictionary which systematically organises the Chinese vocabulary in taxonomic and mereonomic hierarchies thus showing up whole conceptual schemes or cognitive systems. These are taken to circumscribe the changing topology of Chinese mental space. TLS is the first dictionary that systematically registers a range of lexical relations like antonym, converse, epithet etc. TLS thus aims to define conceptual space as a relational space. TLS is the first dictionary of Chinese which incorporates detailed syntactic analysis of (over 600 distinct kinds of) syntactic usage. TLS thus enables us to make a systematic study of such basic phenomena as the natural history of abstract nouns in China. TLS is the first corpus-based dictionary which will record the history of rhetorical devices in texts and will thus enable us to study such intellectually crucial things as the natural history of irony in China.

Examplar-based sampling allows identification of a single representative of cross-linguistically heterogeneous structural domains such as case. These two methods are helpful tools in fieldwork.

NA,"using network approaches to enhance the analysis of cross linguistic polysemies","Since long it has been noted that cross-linguistically recurring polysemies can serve as an indi-cator of conceptual relations, and quite a few approaches to model and analyze such data have been proposed in the recent past. Although – given the nature of the data – it seems natural to model and analyze it with the help of network techniques, there are only a few approaches which make explicit use of them. In this paper, we show how the strict application of weighted network models helps to get more out of cross-linguistic polysemies than would be possible using approaches that are only based on item-to-item comparison. For our study we use a large dataset consisting of 1252 semantic items translated into 195 different languages covering 44 different language families. By analyz-ing the community structure of the network reconstructed from the data, we find that a majority of the concepts (68{\%}) can be separated into 104 large communities consisting of five and more nodes.

The corpus contains a total of over 36 h of recordings of 46 French speakers engaged in conversations with friends.

While Parts 1 and 2 did not require participants to perform any specific task, in Part 3 participants negotiated a common answer to general questions about society. Comparisons with the ESTER corpus of journalistic speech show that the two corpora contain speech of considerably different registers. A number of indicators of casualness, including swear words, casual words, verlan, disfluencies and word repetitions, are more frequent in the NCCFr than in the ESTER corpus, while the use of double negation, an indicator of formal speech, is less frequent. In general, these estimates of casualness are constant through the three parts of the recording sessions and across speakers. Based on these facts, we conclude that our corpus is a rich resource of highly casual speech, and that it can be effectively exploited by researchers in language science and technology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

NA,"the catalogue of semantic shifts as a database for lexical semantic typology","This paper presents an overview of a project that aims at creating a representative Catalogue of cross-linguistically recurrent semantic shifts1 in the languages of the world and at implementing this Catalogue in the form of a searchable computer database2. Such a catalogue is useful in several theoretical and methodological respects. First of all, both universal and language-specific semantic shifts can be considered a window onto human cognitive mechanisms operative in the domain of linguistic conceptualization. Second, the catalogue provides a rich empirical basis for the study of genetic and areal tendencies in semantic change, as well as in polysemy patterns. Another potential application is historical reconstruction, since the catalogue gives evidence for attested paths of diachronic semantic evolution. In section 1 we outline the general concept of the Catalogue of Semantic Shifts. Section 2 describes the design of the computer database. In section 3 we discuss some problematic points that we have faced while working on the Catalogue. The next three sections demonstrate how the Catalogue can be used in linguistic research and present an analysis of three selected issues, namely semantic shifts in the domain of dimension (section 4), motivation strategies in the domain of folk biology (section 5), and euphemization as a mechanism of semantic change (section 6).",NA,2012,"Yes","catalogu semant shift databas lexic semant typolog paper present overview project aim creat repres catalogu cross linguist recurr semant shift languag world implement catalogu form searchabl comput databas catalogu theoret methodolog respect univers languag specif semant shift consid window human cognit mechan oper domain linguist conceptu catalogu rich empir basi studi genet areal tendenc semant chang polysemi pattern potenti applic histor reconstruct catalogu evid attest path diachron semant evolut section outlin general concept catalogu semant shift section describ design comput databas section discuss problemat point face work catalogu section demonstr catalogu linguist research present analysi select issu semant shift domain dimens section motiv strategi domain folk biolog section euphem mechan semant chang section",1
"Embodied cognition,emotional language,modality-specific processing,sensory modalities,valence","taste and smell words form an affectively loaded and emotionally flexible part of the english lexicon","ABSTRACTIn brain and behaviour, gustation, and olfaction are closely linked to emotional processing. This paper shows that similarly, words associated with taste and smell, such as “pungent” and “delicious”, are on average more emotionally valenced than words associated with the other senses, such as “beige” (visual) and “echoing” (auditory). Moreover, taste and smell words occur more frequently in emotionally valenced phrases, for example, “fragrant” modifies more emotionally valenced nouns (“fragrant kiss”) than the visual adjective “yellow” (“yellow house”). It is argued that taste and smell words form an affectively loaded part of the English lexicon. Taste and smell words are also shown to be more emotionally flexible in that words such as “sweet” can be combined with both good and bad nouns (“sweet delight” versus “sweet disaster”), much more so than is the case for sensory words for the other modalities. The paper discusses implications for theories of embodied language understanding.","Language, Cognition and Neuroscience",2016,"Yes","embodi cognitionemot languagemod specif processingsensori modalitiesval tast smell word form affect load emot flexibl part english lexicon abstractin brain behaviour gustat olfact close link emot process paper show similar word tast smell pungent delici averag emot valenc word sens beig visual echo auditori tast smell word occur frequent emot valenc phrase fragrant modifi emot valenc noun fragrant kiss visual adject yellow yellow hous argu tast smell word form affect load part english lexicon tast smell word shown emot flexibl word sweet combin good bad noun sweet delight versus sweet disast case sensori word modal paper discuss implic theori embodi languag understand",1
NA,"iconicity in the speech of children and adults","Iconicity – the correspondence between form and meaning – may help young children learn to use new words. Early‐learned words are higher in iconicity than later learned words. However, it remains unclear what role iconicity may play in actual language use. Here, we ask whether iconicity relates not just to the age at which words are acquired, but also to how frequently children and adults use the words in their speech. If iconicity serves to bootstrap word learning, then we would expect that children should say highly iconic words more frequently than less iconic words, especially early in development. We would also expect adults to use iconic words more often when speaking to children than to other adults. We examined the relationship between frequency and iconicity for approximately 2000 English words. Replicating previous findings, we found that more iconic words are learned earlier. Moreover, we found that more iconic words tend to be used more by younger children, and adults use more iconic words when speaking to children than to other adults. Together, our results show that young children not only learn words rated high in iconicity earlier than words low in iconicity, but they also produce these words more frequently in conversation – a pattern that is reciprocated by adults when speaking with children. Thus, the earliest conversations of children are relatively higher in iconicity, suggesting that this iconicity scaffolds the production and comprehension of spoken language during early development.","Developmental Science",2018,"Yes","icon speech children adult icon correspond form mean young children learn word earli learn word higher icon learn word remain unclear role icon play actual languag icon relat age word acquir frequent children adult word speech icon serv bootstrap word learn expect children high icon word frequent icon word earli develop expect adult icon word speak children adult examin relationship frequenc icon approxim english word replic previous find found icon word learn earlier found icon word tend younger children adult icon word speak children adult result show young children learn word rate high icon earlier word low icon produc word frequent convers pattern reciproc adult speak children earliest convers children higher icon suggest icon scaffold product comprehens spoken languag earli develop",1

These problems are physically compact, often can be solved within short time limits, and have unambiguous solutions, and English versions have been normed for solving rates and levels of difficulty. Many studies on problem solving with sudden insight have taken advantage of these features in paradigms that require many quick solutions (e.g., solution priming, visual hemifield presentations, electroencephalography, fMRI, and eyetracking). In order to promote this vein of research in Italy, as well, we created and tested Italian versions of both of these tests. The data collected across three studies yielded a pool of 88 rebus puzzles and 122 compound remote associate problems within a moderate range of difficulty.

NA,"type and token bigram frequencies for two through nine letter words and the prediction of anagram difficulty","Recent research on anagram solution has produced two original findings. First, it has shown that a new bigram frequency measure called top rank, which is based on a comparison of summed bigram frequencies, is an important predictor of anagram difficulty. Second, it has suggested that the measures from a type count are better than token measures at predicting anagram difficulty. Testing these hypotheses has been difficult because the computation of the bigram statistics is difficult. We present a program that calculates bigram measures for two-to nine-letter words. We then show how the program can be used to compare the contribution of top rank and other bigram frequency measures derived from both a token and a type count. Contrary to previous research, we report that type measures are not better at predicting anagram solution times and that top rank is not the best predictor of anagram difficulty. Lastly we use this program to show that type bigram frequencies are not as good as token bigram frequencies at predicting word identification reaction time.","Behavior Research Methods",2011,"Yes","type token bigram frequenc letter word predict anagram difficulti recent research anagram solut produc origin find shown bigram frequenc measur call top rank base comparison sum bigram frequenc import predictor anagram difficulti suggest measur type count token measur predict anagram difficulti test hypothes difficult comput bigram statist difficult present program calcul bigram measur letter word show program compar contribut top rank bigram frequenc measur deriv token type count contrari previous research report type measur predict anagram solut time top rank predictor anagram difficulti last program show type bigram frequenc good token bigram frequenc predict word identif reaction time",1

Adult participants gave keyboarded responses in their first language under controlled experimental conditions (N = 1,274, with subsamples responding in Bulgarian, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish). We measured the time to initiate a response (RT) and interkeypress intervals, and calculated measures of name and spelling agreement. There was a tendency across all languages for quicker RTs to pictures with higher familiarity, image agreement, and name frequency, and with higher name agreement. Effects of spelling agreement and effects on output rates after writing onset were present in some, but not all, languages. Written naming therefore shows name retrieval effects that are similar to those found in speech, but our findings suggest the need for cross-language comparisons as we seek to understand the orthographic retrieval and/or assembly processes that are specific to written output.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","time written pictur name european languag describ multilanguag written pictur name dataset trial level data time agreement norm written name pictur everyday object compos color snodgrass vanderwart pictur set rossion pourtoi percept adult particip gave keyboard respons languag control experiment condit subsampl respond bulgarian dutch english finnish french german greek iceland italian norwegian portugues russian spanish swedish measur time initi respons rt interkeypress interv calcul measur spell agreement tendenc languag quicker rts pictur higher familiar imag agreement frequenc higher agreement effect spell agreement effect output rate write onset present languag written name show retriev effect similar found speech find suggest cross languag comparison seek understand orthograph retriev assembl process specif written output",1

NA,"the evaluative lexicon 20 the measurement of emotionality extremity and valence in language","The rapid expansion of the Internet and the availability of vast repositories of natural text provide researchers with the immense opportunity to study human reactions, opinions, and behavior on a massive scale. To help researchers take advantage of this new frontier, the present work introduces and validates the Evaluative Lexicon 2.0 (EL 2.0)—a quantitative linguistic tool that specializes in the measurement of the emotionality of individuals' evaluations in text. Specifically, the EL 2.0 utilizes natural language to measure the emotionality, extremity, and valence of evaluative reactions and attitudes. The present article describes how we used a combination of 9 million real-world online reviews and over 1,500 participant judges to construct the EL 2.0 and an additional 5.7 million reviews to validate it. To assess its unique value, the EL 2.0 is compared with two other prominent text analysis tools—LIWC and Warriner et al.'s (Behavior Research Methods, 45, 1191–1207, 2013) wordlist. The EL 2.0 is comparatively distinct in its ability to measure emotionality and explains a significantly greater proportion of the variance in individuals' evaluations. The EL 2.0 can be used with any data that involve speech or writing and provides researchers with the opportunity to capture evaluative reactions both in the laboratory and “in the wild.” The EL 2.0 wordlist and normative emotionality, extremity, and valence ratings are freely available from www.evaluativelexicon.com.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","evalu lexicon measur emot extrem valenc languag rapid expans internet avail vast repositori natur text provid research immens opportun studi human reaction opinion behavior massiv scale research advantag frontier present work introduc valid evalu lexicon el quantit linguist tool special measur emot individu evalu text specif el util natur languag measur emot extrem valenc evalu reaction attitud present articl describ combin million real world onlin review particip judg construct el addit million review valid assess uniqu el compar promin text analysi tool liwc warrin al behavior research method wordlist el compar distinct abil measur emot explain signific greater proport varianc individu evalu el data involv speech write research opportun captur evalu reaction laboratori wild el wordlist normat emot extrem valenc rate freeli wwwevaluativelexicon",1

"Emotional expression,Face database,Infant faces,Stimuli","the city infant faces database a validated set of infant facial expressions","textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s). Adults need to be able to process infants' emotional expressions accurately to respond appropriately and care for infants. However, research on processing of the emotional expressions of infant faces is hampered by the lack of validated stimuli. Although many sets of photographs of adult faces are available to researchers, there are no corresponding sets of photographs of infant faces. We therefore developed and validated a database of infant faces, which is available via e-mail request. Parents were recruited via social media and asked to send photographs of their infant (0–12 months of age) showing positive, negative, and neutral facial expressions. A total of 195 infant faces were obtained and validated. To validate the images, student midwives and nurses (n = 53) and members of the general public (n = 18) rated each image with respect to its facial expression, intensity of expression, clarity of expression, genuineness of expression, and valence. On the basis of these ratings, a total of 154 images with rating agreements of at least 75{\%} were included in the final database. These comprise 60 photographs of positive infant faces, 54 photographs of negative infant faces, and 40 photographs of neutral infant faces. The images have high criterion validity and good test–retest reliability. This database is therefore a useful and valid tool for researchers.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","emot expressionfac databaseinf facesstimuli citi infant face databas valid set infant facial express textcopyright author adult process infant emot express accur respond appropri care infant research process emot express infant face hamper lack valid stimuli set photograph adult face research set photograph infant face develop valid databas infant face mail request parent recruit social media ask send photograph infant month age show posit negat neutral facial express total infant face obtain valid valid imag student midwiv nurs member general public rate imag respect facial express intens express clariti express genuin express valenc basi rate total imag rate agreement includ final databas compris photograph posit infant face photograph negat infant face photograph neutral infant face imag high criterion valid good test retest reliabl databas valid tool research",1
"Corpus,Distributional statistics,Oral language,Phones,Phonotactic regularities,Syllable,Transition probabilities","syllabo a new tool to study sublexical phenomena in spoken quebec french","Sublexical phonotactic regularities in language have a major impact on language development, as well as on speech processing and production throughout the entire lifespan. To understand the impact of phonotactic regularities on speech and language functions at the behavioral and neural levels, it is essential to have access to oral language corpora to study these complex phenomena in different languages. Yet, probably because of their complexity, oral language corpora remain less common than written language corpora. This article presents the first corpus and database of spoken Quebec French syllables and phones: SyllabO+. This corpus contains phonetic transcriptions of over 300,000 syllables (over 690,000 phones) extracted from recordings of 184 healthy adult native Quebec French speakers, ranging in age from 20 to 97 years. To ensure the representativeness of the corpus, these recordings were made in both formal and familiar communication contexts. Phonotactic distributional statistics (e.g., syllable and co-occurrence frequencies, percentages, percentile ranks, transition probabilities, and pointwise mutual information) were computed from the corpus. An open-access online application to search the database was developed, and is available at www.speechneurolab.ca/syllabo . In this article, we present a brief overview of the corpus, as well as the syllable and phone databases, and we discuss their practical applications in various fields of research, including cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, experimental psychology, phonetics, and phonology.

NA,"stimulus needs are a moving target 240 additional matched literal and metaphorical sentences for testing neural hypotheses about metaphor","As the cognitive neuroscience of metaphor has evolved, so too have the theoretical questions of greatest interest. To keep pace with these developments, in the present study we generated a large set of metaphoric and literal sentence pairs ideally suited to addressing the current methodological and conceptual needs of metaphor researchers. In particular, the need has emerged to distinguish metaphors along three dimensions: the grammatical class of their base terms, the sensorimotor features of their base terms, and the syntactic form in which the base terms appear. To meet this need, we generated nominal metaphors (and matched literal sentences) using entity nouns as the base terms, with the intention that they be used in concert with already published sets of predicate metaphors or nominal metaphors using event nouns. Using the results of three norming experiments, we provide 120 pairs of closely matched metaphoric and literal sentences that are characterized along 14 dimensions: 11 at the sentence level (length, frequency, concreteness, familiarity, naturalness, imageability, figurativeness, interpretability, ease of interpretation, valence, and valence judgment reaction time), and three related to the base term (visual, motion, and auditory imagery).

NA,"semantic ambiguity effects on traditional chinese character naming a corpus based approach","Words are considered semantically ambiguous if they have more than one meaning and can be used in multiple contexts. A number of recent studies have provided objective ambiguity measures by using a corpus-based approach and have demonstrated ambiguity advantages in both naming and lexical decision tasks. Although the predictive power of objective ambiguity measures has been examined in several alphabetic language systems, the effects in logographic languages remain unclear. Moreover, most ambiguity measures do not explicitly address how the various contexts associated with a given word relate to each other. To explore these issues, we computed the contextual diversity (Adelman, Brown, {\&} Quesada, Psychological Science, 17; 814-823, 2006) and semantic ambiguity (Hoffman, Lambon Ralph, {\&} Rogers, Behavior Research Methods, 45; 718-730, 2013) of traditional Chinese single-character words based on the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus, where contextual diversity was used to evaluate the present semantic space. We then derived a novel ambiguity measure, namely semantic variability, by computing the distance properties of the distinct clusters grouped by the contexts that contained a given word. We demonstrated that semantic variability was superior to semantic diversity in accounting for the variance in naming response times, suggesting that considering the substructure of the various contexts associated with a given word can provide a relatively fine scale of ambiguity information for a word. All of the context and ambiguity measures for 2,418 Chinese single-character words are provided as supplementary materials.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","semant ambigu effect tradit chines charact name corpus base approach word consid semant ambigu mean multipl context number recent studi provid object ambigu measur corpus base approach demonstr ambigu advantag name lexic decis task predict power object ambigu measur examin alphabet languag system effect logograph languag remain unclear ambigu measur explicit address context word relat explor issu comput contextu divers adelman brown quesada psycholog scienc semant ambigu hoffman lambon ralph roger behavior research method tradit chines singl charact word base academia sinica balanc corpus contextu divers evalu present semant space deriv ambigu measur semant variabl comput distanc properti distinct cluster group context contain word demonstr semant variabl superior semant divers account varianc name respons time suggest substructur context word provid fine scale ambigu inform word context ambigu measur chines singl charact word provid supplementari materi",1

NA,"recognizing vocal emotions in mandarin chinese a validated database of chinese vocal emotional stimuli","To establish a valid database of vocal emotional stimuli in Mandarin Chinese, a set of Chinese pseudosentences (i.e., semantically meaningless sentences that resembled real Chinese) were produced by four native Mandarin speakers to express seven emotional meanings: anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, pleasant surprise, and neutrality. These expressions were identified by a group of native Mandarin listeners in a seven-alternative forced choice task, and items reaching a recognition rate of at least three times chance performance in the seven-choice task were selected as a valid database and then subjected to acoustic analysis. The results demonstrated expected variations in both perceptual and acoustic patterns of the seven vocal emotions in Mandarin. For instance, fear, anger, sadness, and neutrality were associated with relatively high recognition, whereas happiness, disgust, and pleasant surprise were recognized less accurately. Acoustically, anger and pleasant surprise exhibited relatively high mean f0 values and large variation in f0 and amplitude; in contrast, sadness, disgust, fear, and neutrality exhibited relatively low mean f0 values and small amplitude variations, and happiness exhibited a moderate mean f0 value and f0 variation. Emotional expressions varied systematically in speech rate and harmonics-to-noise ratio values as well.

NA,"psycholinguistic measures for german verb pairs semantic transparency semantic relatedness verb family size and age of reading acquisition","A central issue in visual and spoken word recognition is the lexical representation of complex words-in particular, whether the lexical representation of complex words depends on semantic transparency: Is a complex verb like understand lexically represented as a whole word or via its base stand, given that its meaning is not transparent from the meanings of its parts? To study this issue, a number of stimulus characteristics are of interest that are not yet available in public databases of German. This article provides semantic association ratings, lexical paraphrases, and vector-based similarity measures for German verbs, measuring (a) the semantic transparency between 1,259 complex verbs and their bases, (b) the semantic relatedness between 1,109 verb pairs with 432 different bases, and (c) the vector-based similarity measures of 846 verb pairs. Additionally, we include the verb regularity of all verbs and two counts of verb family size for 184 base verbs, as well as estimates of age of acquisition and age of reading for 200 verbs. Together with lemma and type frequencies from public lexical databases, all measures can be downloaded along with this article. Statistical analyses indicate that verb family size, morphological complexity, frequency, and verb regularity affect the semantic transparency and relatedness ratings as well as the age of acquisition estimates, indicating that these are relevant variables in psycholinguistic experiments.

However, existing standardized facial databases, typically used to explore emotion recognition, can be augmented with more contextual information for studying emotion and social perception. Moreover, the perception of social engagement, i.e., the degree of interaction or engagement inferred between the people in target pictures, has not been measured.

Analyses of ratings collected from 62 young adults (30 females, 32 males; mean age 22 years) revealed the typical quadratic relationship between valence and intensity, i.e., stimuli that are more emotionally charged, whether positively or negatively valenced, are more intense than emotionally-neutral stimuli. Moreover, the results showed significant linear and quadratic relationships between valence and social engagement ratings, indicating that emotionally-charged social scenes were perceived as more engaging than emotionally-neutral social scenes.

NA,"perceived emotion genuineness normative ratings for popular facial expression stimuli and the development of perceived as genuine and perceived as fake sets","In everyday social interactions, people's facial expressions sometimes reflect genuine emotion (e.g., anger in response to a misbehaving child) and sometimes do not (e.g., smiling for a school photo). There is increasing theoretical interest in this distinction, but little is known about perceived emotion genuineness for existing facial expression databases. We present a new method for rating perceived genuineness using a neutral-midpoint scale (-7 = completely fake; 0 = don't know; +7 = completely genuine) that, unlike previous methods, provides data on both relative and absolute perceptions. Normative ratings from typically developing adults for five emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and happiness) provide three key contributions. First, the widely used Pictures of Facial Affect (PoFA; i.e., ""the Ekman faces"") and the Radboud Faces Database (RaFD) are typically perceived as not showing genuine emotion. Also, in the only published set for which the actual emotional states of the displayers are known (via self-report; the McLellan faces), percepts of emotion genuineness often do not match actual emotion genuineness.

NA,"norms for 10491 spanish words for five discrete emotions happiness disgust anger fear and sadness","The discrete emotion theory proposes that affective experiences can be reduced to a limited set of universal ""basic"" emotions, most commonly identified as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust. Here we present norms for 10,491 Spanish words for those five discrete emotions collected from a total of 2,010 native speakers, making it the largest set of norms for discrete emotions in any language to date. When used in conjunction with the norms from Hinojosa, Mart{\'{i}}nez-Garc{\'{i}}a et al.

NA,"norming the odd creation norming and validation of a stimulus set for the study of incongruities across music and language","Research into similarities between music and language processing is currently experiencing a strong renewed interest. Recent methodological advances have led to neuroimaging studies presenting striking similarities between neural patterns associated with the processing of music and language--notably, in the study of participants' responses to elements that are incongruous with their musical or linguistic context. Responding to a call for greater systematicity by leading researchers in the field of music and language psychology, this article describes the creation, selection, and validation of a set of auditory stimuli in which both congruence and resolution were manipulated in equivalent ways across harmony, rhythm, semantics, and syntax. Three conditions were created by changing the contexts preceding and following musical and linguistic incongruities originally used for effect by authors and composers: Stimuli in the incongruous-resolved condition reproduced the original incongruity and resolution into the same context; stimuli in the incongruous-unresolved condition reproduced the incongruity but continued postincongruity with a new context dictated by the incongruity; and stimuli in the congruous condition presented the same element of interest, but the entire context was adapted to match it so that it was no longer incongruous. The manipulations described in this article rendered unrecognizable the original incongruities from which the stimuli were adapted, while maintaining ecological validity. The norming procedure and validation study resulted in a significant increase in perceived oddity from congruous to incongruous-resolved and from incongruous-resolved to incongruous-unresolved in all four components of music and language, making this set of stimuli a theoretically grounded and empirically validated resource for this growing area of research.","Behavior Research Methods",2012,"Yes","norm odd creation norm valid stimulus set studi incongru music languag research similar music languag process experienc strong renew interest recent methodolog advanc led neuroimag studi present strike similar neural pattern process music languag notabl studi particip respons element incongru music linguist context respond call greater systemat lead research field music languag psycholog articl describ creation select valid set auditori stimuli congruenc resolut manipul equival way harmoni rhythm semant syntax condit creat chang context preced music linguist incongru origin effect author compos stimuli incongru resolv condit reproduc origin incongru resolut context stimuli incongru unresolv condit reproduc incongru continu postincongru context dictat incongru stimuli congruous condit present element interest entir context adapt match longer incongru manipul articl render unrecogniz origin incongru stimuli adapt maintain ecolog valid norm procedur valid studi result signific increas perceiv odditi congruous incongru resolv incongru resolv incongru unresolv compon music languag make set stimuli theoret ground empir valid resourc grow area research",1

Twelve component actions in each of 30 activities were chosen. Two of the dimensions examined were the familiarity and frequency of performance of the activities themselves. The other four dimensions—sequence, centrality, distinctiveness, and standardness—are characteristics of the actions within the activities. There was high agreement among subjects on the norms for each dimension.

NA,"normative accuracy and response time data for the computerized benton facial recognition test bfrt c","We report normative data from a large (N = 307) sample of young adult participants tested with a computerized version of the long form of the classical Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT; Benton {\&} Van Allen, 1968). The BFRT-c requires participants to match a target face photograph to either one or three of six face photographs presented simultaneously. We found that the percent accuracy on the BFRT-c (81{\%}-83{\%}) was below ceiling yet well above chance level, with little interindividual variance in this typical population sample, two important aspects of a sensitive clinical test. Although the split-half reliability on response accuracy was relatively low, due to the large variability in difficulty across items, the correct response times measured in this version-completed in 3 min, on average-provide a reliable and critical complementary measure of performance at individual unfamiliar-face matching. In line with previous observations from other measures, females outperformed male participants at the BFRT-c, especially for female faces. In general, performance was also lower following lighting changes than following head rotations, in line with previous studies that have emphasized participants' limited ability to match pictures of unfamiliar faces with important variations in illumination. Overall, this normative data set supports the validity of the BFRT-c as a key component of a battery of tests to identify clinical impairments in individual face recognition, such as observed in acquired prosopagnosia. However, this analysis strongly recommends that researchers consider the full test results: Beyond global indexes of performance based on accuracy rates only, they should consider the time taken to match individual faces as well as the variability in performance across items.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","normat accuraci respons time data computer benton facial recognit test bfrt report normat data larg sampl young adult particip test computer version long form classic benton facial recognit test bfrt benton van allen bfrt requir particip match target face photograph face photograph present simultan found percent accuraci bfrt ceil chanc level interindividu varianc typic popul sampl import aspect sensit clinic test split half reliabl respons accuraci low due larg variabl difficulti item correct respons time measur version complet min averag provid reliabl critic complementari measur perform individu unfamiliar face match line previous observ measur femal outperform male particip bfrt femal face general perform lower light head rotat line previous studi emphas particip limit abil match pictur unfamiliar face import variat illumin normat data set support valid bfrt key compon batteri test identifi clinic impair individu face recognit observ acquir prosopagnosia analysi strong recommend research full test result global index perform base accuraci rate time match individu face variabl perform item",1

Although NWR tasks have been created for a variety of languages, minimal attention has been given to Asian tonal languages. This study introduces a new set of NWR stimuli for Vietnamese. The stimuli include 20 items ranging in length from one to four syllables. The items consist of dialect-neutral phonemes in consonant-vowel (CV) and CVC sequences that follow the phonotactic constraints of the language. They were rated high on wordlikeness and have comparable position segments and biphone probabilities across stimulus lengths. We validated the stimuli with a sample of 59 typically developing Vietnamese-English bilingual children, ages 5 to 8. The stimuli exhibited the expected age and length effects commonly found in NWR tasks: Older children performed better on the task than younger children, and longer items were more difficult to repeat than shorter items. We also compared different scoring systems in order to examine the individual phoneme types (consonants, vowels, and tones) and composite scores (proportions of phonemes correct, with and without tone). The study demonstrates careful construction and validation of the stimuli, and future directions are discussed.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","nonword repetit stimuli vietnames speak children nonword repetit nwr wide measur languag learn abil children languag disord nwr task creat varieti languag minim attent asian tonal languag studi introduc set nwr stimuli vietnames stimuli includ item rang length syllabl item consist dialect neutral phonem conson vowel cv cvc sequenc follow phonotact constraint languag rate high wordlik compar posit segment biphon probabl stimulus length valid stimuli sampl typic develop vietnames english bilingu children age stimuli exhibit expect age length effect common found nwr task older children perform task younger children longer item difficult repeat shorter item compar score system order examin individu phonem type conson vowel tone composit score proport phonem correct tone studi demonstr care construct valid stimuli futur direct discuss",1

NA,"morpholex a derivational morphological database for 70000 english words","Most of the new words a reader will find are morphologically complex. Also, theoretical models of language processing propose that morphology plays an important role in visual word processing. Nevertheless, studies on the subject show contradicting results that are difficult to reconcile. One factor that may explain this is the lack of a sizeable and reliable morphological database. As a consequence, there are enormous methodological differences in the way the values for morphological variables are calculated across studies. We present a sizeable and freely available database with six new variables for affixes and three for roots for 68,624 words from the English Lexicon Project. We further studied by means of regression models the influence of these new variables on the lexical decision latencies of 4,724 morphologically complex nouns that included one root and one suffix. Results showed that root frequency and suffix length had a facilitatory effect, whereas the percentage of more frequent words in the morphological family of the suffix had an inhibitory effect on latencies. After controlling for collinearity, root family size, suffix family size, suffix P*, and suffix frequency also had facilitatory effects. These results shed new light on the importance of suffix length and the frequency of the lexical competitors of the family of a suffix.

NA,"modality exclusivity norms for 423 object properties","Recent work has shown that people routinely use perceptual information during language comprehension and conceptual processing, from single-word recognition to modality-switching costs in property verification. In investigating such links between perceptual and conceptual representations, the use of modality-specific stimuli plays a central role. To aid researchers working in this area, we provide a set of norms for 423 adjectives, each describing an object property, with mean ratings of how strongly that property is experienced through each of five perceptual modalities (visual, haptic, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory). The data set also contains estimates of modality exclusivity—that is, a measure of the extent to which a particular property may be considered unimodal (i.e., perceived through one sense alone). Although there already exists a number of sets of word and object norms, we provide the first set to categorize words describing object properties along the dimensions of the five perceptual modalities. We hope that the norms will be of use to researchers working at the interface between linguistic, conceptual, and perceptual systems.

NA,"minho affective sentences mas probing the roles of sex mood and empathy in affective ratings of verbal stimuli","During social communication, words and sentences play a critical role in the expression of emotional meaning. The Minho Affective Sentences (MAS) were developed to respond to the lack of a standardized sentence battery with normative affective ratings: 192 neutral, positive, and negative declarative sentences were strictly controlled for psycholinguistic variables such as numbers of words and letters and per-million word frequency. The sentences were designed to represent examples of each of the five basic emotions (anger, sadness, disgust, fear, and happiness) and of neutral situations. These sentences were presented to 536 participants who rated the stimuli using both dimensional and categorical measures of emotions. Sex differences were also explored. Additionally, we probed how personality, empathy, and mood from a subset of 40 participants modulated the affective ratings. Our results confirmed that the MAS affective norms are valid measures to guide the selection of stimuli for experimental studies of emotion. The combination of dimensional and categorical ratings provided a more fine-grained characterization of the affective properties of the sentences. Moreover, the affective ratings of positive and negative sentences were not only modulated by participants' sex, but also by individual differences in empathy and mood state. Together, our results indicate that, in their quest to reveal the neurofunctional underpinnings of verbal emotional processing, researchers should consider not only the role of sex, but also of interindividual differences in empathy and mood states, in responses to the emotional meaning of sentences.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","minho affect sentenc mas probe role sex mood empathi affect rate verbal stimuli social communic word sentenc play critic role express emot mean minho affect sentenc mas develop respond lack standard sentenc batteri normat affect rate neutral posit negat declar sentenc strict control psycholinguist variabl number word letter million word frequenc sentenc design repres exampl basic emot anger sad disgust fear happi neutral situat sentenc present particip rate stimuli dimension categor measur emot sex differ explor addit probe person empathi mood subset particip modul affect rate result confirm mas affect norm valid measur guid select stimuli experiment studi emot combin dimension categor rate provid fine grain character affect properti sentenc affect rate posit negat sentenc modul particip sex individu differ empathi mood state result quest reveal neurofunct underpin verbal emot process research role sex interindividu differ empathi mood state respons emot mean sentenc",1

On the basis of data obtained from Qatari Arabic, a variety of Gulf Arabic, the present study provides norms for a set of 319 object pictures and a set of 141 action pictures. Norms were collected from healthy speakers, using a picture-naming paradigm and rating tasks. Norms for naming latencies, name agreement, visual complexity, image agreement, imageability, age of acquisition, and familiarity were established. Furthermore, the database includes other intrinsic factors, such as syllable length and phoneme length. It also includes orthographic frequency values (extracted from Aralex; Boudelaa {\&} Marslen-Wilson, 2010). These factors were then examined for their impact on picture-naming latencies in object- and action-naming tasks. The analysis showed that the primary determinants of naming latencies in both nouns and verbs are (in descending order) image agreement, name agreement, familiarity, age of acquisition, and imageability. These results indicate no evidence that noun- and verb-naming processes in Gulf Arabic are influenced in different ways by these variables. This is the first database for Gulf Arabic, and therefore the norms collected from the present study will be of paramount importance for researchers and clinicians working with speakers of this variety of Arabic. Due to the similarity of the Arabic varieties spoken in the Gulf, these different varieties are grouped together under the label ""Gulf Arabic"" in the literature.

NA,"graphcom a multidimensional measure of graphic complexity applied to 131 written languages","We report a new multidimensional measure of visual complexity (GraphCom) that captures variability in the complexity of graphs within and across writing systems. We applied the measure to 131 written languages, allowing comparisons of complexity and providing a basis for empirical testing of GraphCom. The measure includes four dimensions whose value in capturing the different visual properties of graphs had been demonstrated in prior reading research—(1) perimetric complexity, sensitive to the ratio of a written form to its surrounding white space (Pelli, Burns, Farell, {\&} Moore-Page, 2006); (2) number of disconnected components, sensitive to discontinuity (Gibson, 1969); (3) number of connected points, sensitive to continuity (Lanthier, Risko, Stolz, {\&} Besner, 2009); and (4) number of simple features, sensitive to the strokes that compose graphs (Wu, Zhou, {\&} Shu, 1999). In our analysis of the complexity of 21,550 graphs, we (a) determined the complexity variation across writing systems along each dimension, (b) examined the relationships among complexity patterns within and across writing systems, and (c) compared the dimensions in their abilities to differentiate the graphs from different writing systems, in order to predict human perceptual judgments (n = 180) of graphs with varying complexity. The results from the computational and experimental comparisons showed that GraphCom provides a measure of graphic complexity that exceeds previous measures in its empirical validation. The measure can be universally applied across writing systems, providing a research tool for studies of reading and writing.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","graphcom multidimension measur graphic complex appli written languag report multidimension measur visual complex graphcom captur variabl complex graph write system appli measur written languag allow comparison complex provid basi empir test graphcom measur includ dimens captur visual properti graph demonstr prior read research perimetr complex sensit ratio written form surround white space pelli burn farel moor page number disconnect compon sensit discontinu gibson number connect point sensit continu lanthier risko stolz besner number simpl featur sensit stroke compos graph wu zhou shu analysi complex graph determin complex variat write system dimens examin relationship complex pattern write system compar dimens abil differenti graph write system order predict human perceptu judgment graph vari complex result comput experiment comparison show graphcom measur graphic complex exceed previous measur empir valid measur univers appli write system provid research tool studi read write",1
NA,"gesture and action exemplar grace video database stimuli for research on manners of human locomotion and iconic gestures","Human locomotion is a fundamental class of events, and manners of locomotion (e.g., how the limbs are used to achieve a change of location) are commonly encoded in language and gesture. To our knowledge, there is no openly accessible database containing normed human locomotion stimuli. Therefore, we introduce the GestuRe and ACtion Exemplar (GRACE) video database, which contains 676 videos of actors performing novel manners of human locomotion (i.e., moving from one location to another in an unusual manner) and videos of a female actor producing iconic gestures that represent these actions. The usefulness of the database was demonstrated across four norming experiments. First, our database contains clear matches and mismatches between iconic gesture videos and action videos. Second, the male actors and female actors whose action videos matched the gestures in the best possible way, perform the same actions in very similar manners and different actions in highly distinct manners. Third, all the actions in the database are distinct from each other. Fourth, adult native English speakers were unable to describe the 26 different actions concisely, indicating that the actions are unusual. This normed stimuli set is useful for experimental psychologists working in the language, gesture, visual perception, categorization, memory, and other related domains.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","gestur action exemplar grace video databas stimuli research manner human locomot icon gestur human locomot fundament class event manner locomot limb achiev chang locat common encod languag gestur knowledg open access databas norm human locomot stimuli introduc gestur action exemplar grace video databas video actor perform manner human locomot move locat unusu manner video femal actor produc icon gestur repres action use databas demonstr norm experi databas clear match mismatch icon gestur video action video male actor femal actor action video match gestur perform action similar manner action high distinct manner action databas distinct fourth adult nativ english speaker unabl describ action concis indic action unusu norm stimuli set experiment psychologist work languag gestur visual percept categor memori relat domain",1

"Arousal ratings,Emotion,Lexical norms,Taboo ratings,Valence ratings","dutch taboo norms","This article provides norms for general taboo, personal taboo, insult, valence, and arousal for 672 Dutch words, including 202 taboo words. Norms were collected using a 7-point Likert scale and based on ratings by psychology students from the Erasmus University Rotterdam in The Netherlands. The sample consisted of 87 psychology students (58 females, 29 males). We obtained high reliability based on split-half analyses. Our norms show high correlations with arousal and valence ratings collected by another Dutch word-norms study (Moors et al.,, Behavior Research Methods, 45, 169-177, 2013). Our results show that the previously found qua-dratic relation (i.e., U-shaped pattern) between valence and arousal also holds when only taboo words are considered. Additionally, words rated high on taboo tended to be rated low on valence, but some words related to sex rated high on both taboo and valence. Words that rated high on taboo rated high on insult, again with the exception of words related to sex many of which rated low on insult. Finally, words rated high on taboo and insult rated high on arousal. The Dutch Taboo Norms (DTN) database is a useful tool for researchers interested in the effects of taboo words on cognitive processing.

The two-dimensional valence and arousal model of affect underlying the BAWL is traditionally contrasted with models describing affect in discrete emotional categories, which, however, are not currently incorporated in the BAWL. In order to allow future studies to investigate affective processing from both perspectives--or to directly compare them--in the present study, we collected data by assigning nouns taken from the BAWL-R to discrete emotion intensities, which in turn allowed the assignment to discrete emotion categories. In the study, we present Discrete Emotion Norms for Nouns-Berlin Affective Word List (DENN-BAWL).

"Automatic alignment,Language production,Time course,Voice-key","aligntool the automatic temporal alignment of spoken utterances in german dutch and british english for psycholinguistic purposes","textcopyright} 2018 Psychonomic Society, Inc. In language production research, the latency with which speakers produce a spoken response to a stimulus and the onset and offset times of words in longer utterances are key dependent variables. Measuring these variables automatically often yields partially incorrect results. However, exact measurements through the visual inspection of the recordings are extremely time-consuming. We present AlignTool, an open-source alignment tool that establishes preliminarily the onset and offset times of words and phonemes in spoken utterances using Praat, and subsequently performs a forced alignment of the spoken utterances and their orthographic transcriptions in the automatic speech recognition system MAUS. AlignTool creates a Praat TextGrid file for inspection and manual correction by the user, if necessary. We evaluated AlignTool's performance with recordings of single-word and four-word utterances as well as semi-spontaneous speech. AlignTool performs well with audio signals with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, requiring virtually no corrections. For audio signals of lesser quality, AlignTool still is highly functional but its results may require more frequent manual corrections. We also found that audio recordings including long silent intervals tended to pose greater difficulties for AlignTool than recordings filled with speech, which AlignTool analyzed well overall. We expect that by semi-automatizing the temporal analysis of complex utterances, AlignTool will open new avenues in language production research.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","automat alignmentlanguag productiontim voic key aligntool automat tempor align spoken utter german dutch british english psycholinguist purpos textcopyright psychonom societi languag product research latenc speaker produc spoken respons stimulus onset offset time word longer utter key depend variabl measur variabl automat yield partial incorrect result exact measur visual inspect record extrem time consum present aligntool open sourc align tool establish preliminarili onset offset time word phonem spoken utter praat subsequ perform forc align spoken utter orthograph transcript automat speech recognit system maus aligntool creat praat textgrid file inspect manual correct user evalu aligntool perform record singl word word utter semi spontan speech aligntool perform audio signal excel signal nois ratio requir virtual correct audio signal lesser qualiti aligntool high function result requir frequent manual correct found audio record includ long silent interv tend pose greater difficulti aligntool record fill speech aligntool analyz expect semi automat tempor analysi complex utter aligntool open avenu languag product research",1
NA,"agsuite software to conduct feature analysis of artificial grammar learning performance","To simplify the problem of studying how people learn natural language, researchers use the artificial grammar learning (AGL) task. In this task, participants study letter strings constructed according to the rules of an artificial grammar and subsequently attempt to discriminate grammatical from ungrammatical test strings. Although the data from these experiments are usually analyzed by comparing the mean discrimination performance between experimental conditions, this practice discards information about the individual items and participants that could otherwise help uncover the particular features of strings associated with grammaticality judgments. However, feature analysis is tedious to compute, often complicated, and ill-defined in the literature. Moreover, the data violate the assumption of independence underlying standard linear regression models, leading to Type I error inflation. To solve these problems, we present AGSuite, a free Shiny application for researchers studying AGL. The suite's intuitive Web-based user interface allows researchers to generate strings from a database of published grammars, compute feature measures (e.g., Levenshtein distance) for each letter string, and conduct a feature analysis on the strings using linear mixed effects (LME) analyses. The LME analysis solves the inflation of Type I errors that afflicts more common methods of repeated measures regression analysis. Finally, the software can generate a number of graphical representations of the data to support an accurate interpretation of results. We hope the ease and availability of these tools will encourage researchers to take full advantage of item-level variance in their datasets in the study of AGL.

NA,"affective auditory stimulus database an expanded version of the international affective digitized sounds iads e","Using appropriate stimuli to evoke emotions is especially important for researching emotion. Psychologists have provided several standardized affective stimulus databases-such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS) as visual stimulus databases, as well as the International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS) and the Montreal Affective Voices as auditory stimulus databases for emotional experiments. However, considering the limitations of the existing auditory stimulus database studies, research using auditory stimuli is relatively limited compared with the studies using visual stimuli. First, the number of sample sounds is limited, making it difficult to equate across emotional conditions and semantic categories. Second, some artificially created materials (music or human voice) may fail to accurately drive the intended emotional processes. Our principal aim was to expand existing auditory affective sample database to sufficiently cover natural sounds. We asked 207 participants to rate 935 sounds (including the sounds from the IADS-2) using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) and three basic-emotion rating scales. The results showed that emotions in sounds can be distinguished on the affective rating scales, and the stability of the evaluations of sounds revealed that we have successfully provided a larger corpus of natural, emotionally evocative auditory stimuli, covering a wide range of semantic categories. Our expanded, standardized sound sample database may promote a wide range of research in auditory systems and the possible interactions with other sensory modalities, encouraging direct reliable comparisons of outcomes from different researchers in the field of psychology.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","affect auditori stimulus databas expand version intern affect digit sound iad stimuli evok emot import research emot psychologist provid standard affect stimulus databas intern affect pictur system iap nencki affect pictur system nap visual stimulus databas intern affect digit sound iad montreal affect voic auditori stimulus databas emot experi limit exist auditori stimulus databas studi research auditori stimuli limit compar studi visual stimuli number sampl sound limit make difficult equat emot condit semant categori artifici creat materi music human voic fail accur drive intend emot process princip aim expand exist auditori affect sampl databas suffici cover natur sound ask particip rate sound includ sound iad assess manikin sam basic emot rate scale result show emot sound distinguish affect rate scale stabil evalu sound reveal success provid larger corpus natur emot evoc auditori stimuli cover wide rang semant categori expand standard sound sampl databas promot wide rang research auditori system interact sensori modal encourag direct reliabl comparison outcom research field psycholog",1

The 147 objects have been normed for name agreement, image agreement, familiarity, visual complexity, and corresponding lexical characteristics of the modal object names. The availability of standardized 3-D objects for virtual reality research is important, because reaching valid theoretical conclusions hinges critically on the use of well-controlled experimental stimuli. Sharing standardized 3-D objects across different virtual reality labs will allow for science to move forward more quickly.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","d objectsdatabasestimulivirtu realiti standard set object virtual realiti research applic immers virtual realiti research tool rapid increas numer scientif disciplin combin ecolog valid strict experiment control immers virtual realiti potenti develop test scientif theori rich environ close resembl everyday set articl introduc standard databas color dimension object virtual realiti augment realiti research applic object norm agreement imag agreement familiar visual complex lexic characterist modal object name avail standard object virtual realiti research import reach valid theoret conclus hing critic control experiment stimuli share standard object virtual realiti lab scienc move forward quick",1
NA,"a standardized list of affect related life events","In experimental contexts, affect-related word lists have been widely applied when examining how cognitive processes interact with emotional processes. These lists, however, present limitations when studying the relation between emotion and cognitive processes such as time and number processing because affective words do not inherently contain time or quantity information. Live events, in contrast, are experienced by an observer and therefore inherently carry affect information. Unfortunately, existing life-event lists and inventories have been largely applied within clinical contexts as diagnostic tools, and therefore are not suitable for many experimental contexts because they do not contain a balanced number of reliably positive, negative, and neutral life events. In Experiment 1, we create a standardized affect-related life-events list with 171 positive, negative, and neutral affect-related life events. In Experiment 2, we show that strength of affect and significance of the event are integral dimensions, suggesting that these two features are difficult to separate perceptually. The implications of these findings and some potential future applications of the created life-events list are discussed.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","standard list affect relat life event experiment context affect relat word list wide appli examin cognit process interact emot process list present limit studi relat emot cognit process time number process affect word inher time quantiti inform live event contrast experienc observ inher carri affect inform exist life event list inventori larg appli clinic context diagnost tool suitabl experiment context balanc number reliabl posit negat neutral life event experi creat standard affect relat life event list posit negat neutral affect relat life event experi show strength affect signific event integr dimens suggest featur difficult separ perceptu implic find potenti futur applic creat life event list discuss",1
NA,"a database of orthography semantics consistency osc estimates for 15017 english words","Orthography-semantics consistency (OSC) is a measure that quantifies the degree of semantic relatedness between a word and its orthographic relatives. OSC is computed as the frequency-weighted average semantic similarity between the meaning of a given word and the meanings of all the words containing that very same orthographic string, as captured by distributional semantic models. We present a resource including optimized estimates of OSC for 15,017 English words. In a series of analyses, we provide a progressive optimization of the OSC variable. We show that computing OSC from word-embeddings models (in place of traditional count models), limiting preprocessing of the corpus used for inducing semantic vectors (in particular, avoiding part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization), and relying on a wider pool of orthographic relatives provide better performance for the measure in a lexical-processing task. We further show that OSC is an important and significant predictor of reaction times in visual word recognition and word naming, one that correlates only weakly with other psycholinguistic variables (e.g., family size, word frequency), indicating that it captures a novel source of variance in lexical access. Finally, some theoretical and methodological implications are discussed of adopting OSC as one of the predictors of reaction times in studies of visual word recognition.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"Yes","databas orthographi semant consist osc estim english word orthographi semant consist osc measur quantifi degre semant related word orthograph relat osc comput frequenc weight averag semant similar mean word mean word orthograph string captur distribut semant model present resourc includ optim estim osc english word seri analys provid progress optim osc variabl show comput osc word embed model place tradit count model limit preprocess corpus induc semant vector avoid part speech tag lemmat reli wider pool orthograph relat provid perform measur lexic process task show osc import signific predictor reaction time visual word recognit word name correl weak psycholinguist variabl famili size word frequenc indic captur sourc varianc lexic access final theoret methodolog implic discuss adopt osc predictor reaction time studi visual word recognit",1

For minority languages, however, the progress is largely behind the main stream. A particularly obstacle is that there are almost no large-scale speech databases for minority languages, and the only few databases are held by some institutes as private properties, far from open and standard, and very few are free. Besides the speech database, phonetic and linguistic resources are also scarce, including phone set, lexicon, and language model.

Prior to its privatisation in 1984, BT was a public corporation (and before that a government department) and as a result all of the pre-privatisation material in the archives is in the public domain, making it ideal for academic research. Despite this legal availability, however, the physical availability of material in the archive was limited to two days a week in an archive space in Holborn, London. In 2011 the ‘New Connections' project was set up with the aim of making around half a million items from the public archives of British Telecom available in a new digital archive. As part of ‘New Connections', three academic research projects were funded, one of which was the creation and analysis of the British Telecom Correspondence Corpus (BTCC). The era that the archive covers makes it a potentially fascinating source of data for the linguistic study of business correspondence. The mid-nineteenth to latetwentieth century is a crucial period in the development of English business correspondence as the amount of business being conducted by letter increased massively during this period as a result of the Industrial Revolution, the introduction of the Penny Post, and increased access to education both in schools and through composition grammar guides.

The corpus was started at the University of Turku in 2007, and the initial motivation for its collection was to make it possible to deal with novel linguistic challenges posed by academic immigration and to contribute to corpus linguistics, Finnish linguistics and the study of second language acquisition. This paper describes the typological standpoint of the LAS2, its position with respect to other corpora of learner Finnish, the compilation criteria, the annotation applied and the workflow implemented. The corpus consists of three subcorpora of written academic texts of non-native speakers of Finnish. The subcorpora are 1) texts for examination purposes, 2) texts for publishing and graduating purposes, and 3) texts for studying and learning purposes. The informants either study or work in Finnish within academia in Finland. When available, the data has been collected longitudinally. A reference corpus for each subcorpus written by native speakers has also been compiled. Three query tools designed within the framework of the LAS2 are also introduced. These tools enable queries based on any combinations of the linguistic annotation. They can also be used to analyse the typical inner or cotextual variation of any user-specified linguistic node or to create frequency lists of multiword units defined at any level of the annotation. The queries can be limited to a user-specified subset of the data.","Apples: journal of applied language studies",2014,"Yes","annotationcorpus toolscorpus typologyfinnish languagelearn languag corpus advanc learner finnish las databas toolkit studi academ learner finnish paper introduc corpus advanc learner finnish las exist corpora learner finnish corpus start univers turku initi motiv collect make deal linguist challeng pose academ immigr contribut corpus linguist finnish linguist studi languag acquisit paper describ typolog standpoint las posit respect corpora learner finnish compil criteria annot appli workflow implement corpus consist subcorpora written academ text nativ speaker finnish subcorpora text examin purpos text publish graduat purpos text studi learn purpos inform studi work finnish academia finland data collect longitudin refer corpus subcorpus written nativ speaker compil queri tool design framework las introduc tool enabl queri base combin linguist annot analys typic cotextu variat user linguist node creat frequenc list multiword unit defin level annot queri limit user subset data",1

NA,"the nencki affective picture system naps introduction to a novel standardized wide range high quality realistic picture database","Selecting appropriate stimuli to induce emotional states is essential in affective research. Only a few standardized affective stimulus databases have been created for auditory, language, and visual materials. Numerous studies have extensively employed these databases using both behavioral and neuroimaging methods. However, some limitations of the existing databases have recently been reported, including limited numbers of stimuli in specific categories or poor picture quality of the visual stimuli. In the present article, we introduce the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS), which consists of 1,356 realistic, high-quality photographs that are divided into five categories (people, faces, animals, objects, and landscapes). Affective ratings were collected from 204 mostly European participants. The pictures were rated according to the valence, arousal, and approach-avoidance dimensions using computerized bipolar semantic slider scales. Normative ratings for the categories are presented for each dimension. Validation of the ratings was obtained by comparing them to ratings generated using the Self-Assessment Manikin and the International Affective Picture System. In addition, the physical properties of the photographs are reported, including luminance, contrast, and entropy. The new database, with accompanying ratings and image parameters, allows researchers to select a variety of visual stimulus materials specific to their experimental questions of interest.

NA,"phi square lexical competition database phi lex an online tool for quantifying auditory and visual lexical competition","A widely agreed-upon feature of spoken word recognition is that multiple lexical candidates in memory are simultaneously activated in parallel when a listener hears a word, and that those candidates compete for recognition (Luce, Goldinger, Auer, {\&} Vitevitch, Perception 62:615-625, 2000; Luce {\&} Pisoni, Ear and Hearing 19:1-36, 1998; McClelland {\&} Elman, Cognitive Psychology 18:1-86, 1986). Because the presence of those competitors influences word recognition, much research has sought to quantify the processes of lexical competition. Metrics that quantify lexical competition continuously are more effective predictors of auditory and visual (lipread) spoken word recognition than are the categorical metrics traditionally used (Feld {\&} Sommers, Speech Communication 53:220-228, 2011; Strand {\&} Sommers, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 130:1663-1672, 2011).

Eighty Flemish first-year psychology students from the Ghent University (Belgium) rated valence, dominance and arousal for a stratified sample of 60 IAPS pictures. Reliability coefficients indicate that the self-report ratings are internally consistent. Four findings converge upon the idea that the ratings in the Flemish sample are similar to the normative ratings. First, the affective ratings of the pictures in our sample correlated strongly with the North American ratings: .95, .84 and .87, respectively for valence, arousal and dominance. Second, mean valence and arousal ratings of the 60 pictures did not significantly differ between the Flemish and the North American sample.

NA,"bidirectional synonym ratings of 464 noun pairs","Each of 464 noun pairs was rated for synonymy on a 7-point scale by 100 college students. The purpose of this study was twofold. First, it was designed to provide memory and psycholinguistic researchers with extensive synonym norms. Second, it was designed to evaluate the effects of encoding order on perceived synonymy. The hypothesis that limited semantic-memory access can cause synonym pairs to be rated as more synonymous in one word-order than in the other was tested by presenting each noun pair to 50 judges in one order and to another 50 judges in the reverse order. Mean synonym ratings (averaged across word orders) ranged from 6.79 to 2.24, thus demonstrating the need for normative data on synonyms. A significant number of noun pairs showed strong directional effects such that perceived synonymy was significantly changed by word encoding order. The practical and theoretical importance of these directional effects are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1979 Academic Press, Inc.","Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior",1979,"Yes","bidirect synonym rate noun pair noun pair rate synonymi point scale colleg student purpos studi twofold design provid memori psycholinguist research extens synonym norm design evalu effect encod order perceiv synonymi hypothesi limit semant memori access synonym pair rate synonym word order test present noun pair judg order judg revers order synonym rate averag word order rang demonstr normat data synonym signific number noun pair show strong direct effect perceiv synonymi signific chang word encod order practic theoret import direct effect discuss textcopyright academ press",1

NA,"modelling parsing constraints with high dimensional context space","Deriving representations of meaning has been a long-standing problem in cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics. The lack of a model for representing semantic and grammatical knowledge has been a handicap in attempting to model the effects of semantic constraints in human syntactic processing. A computational model of high-dimensional context space, the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL), is presented with a series of simulations modelling a variety of human empirical results. HAL learns its representations from the unsupervised processing of 300 million words of conversational text. HAL's high-dimensional context space can be used to (1) provide a basic categorization of semantic and grammatical concepts, (2) model certain aspects of morphological ambiguity in verbs, and (3) provide an account of semantic context effects in syntactic processing. The authors propose that the distributed and contextually derived representations that HAL acquires provide a basis for the subconceptual knowledge that can be used in accounting for a diverse set of cognitive phenomena.

"Congestion rent,LMP,OPF,TCSC","international affective picture system iaps technical manual and affective ratings","This paper proposes two new methodologies for the placement of series FACTS devices in deregulated electricity market to reduce congestion. Similar to sensitivity factor based method, the proposed methods form a priority list that reduces the solution space. The proposed methodologies are based on the use of LMP differences and congestion rent, respectively. The methods are computationally efficient, since LMPs are the by-product of a security constrained OPF and congestion rent is a function of LMP difference and power flows. The proposed methodologies are tested and validated for locating TCSC in IEEE 14-, IEEE 30- and IEEE 57-bus test systems. Results obtained with the proposed methods are compared with that of the sensitivity method and with exhaustive OPF solutions. The overall objective of FACTS device placement can be either to minimize the total congestion rent or to maximize the social welfare. Results show that the proposed methods are capable of finding the best location for TCSC installation, that suite both objectives. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

NA,"a letterdigit matrix of auditory confusions","A matrix is presented of the errors of perception made by 135 men and women listening to three male and three female speakers reading aloud different randomized lists constructed from the letters of the alphabet and the digits 1—9, heard in white noise. Data from a short-term memory (STM) experiment, using simultaneous visual presentation and immediate ordered recall of two selected vocabularies of nine letters and the digits 1-9, are cited as evidence of phonemic confusion between letters and digits in STM. Conrad (1964) established a high correlation between the systematic errors made by Hsteners identifying letters of the alphabet spoken one at a time in white noise (auditory confusions), and those made by subjects when visually presented with strings of alphabetic material for immediate ordered recall. Briefly, items which sounded similar were more probably confused not only in listening, but also in short-term memory (STM). Once this relationship between auditory and STM errors had been demonstrated, it was possible, using Clarke's constant ratio rule (Clarke, 1957), to select from the listening matrix subsets of letters of diifering probabilities of auditory confusion. Conrad {\&} Hull (1964) have shown that such subsets selected for minimal auditory confusability, whether of three or nine items in the vocabulary, are significantly better recalled, after visual sequential presentation, than subsets of letters of high auditory confusability. In STM tasks using both letters and digits, Wickelgren (1965) with auditory pre-sentation, and Hintzman (1965) using visual stimuli, have shown that inter-class errors are also related to phonemic similarity. Definition of the extent and relative confusability of letters with digits has been hampered by the lack of a complete matrix of auditory confusions amongst these stimuli. The provision of such a matrix was the purpose of this study.

The elicited sentences cannot give a particularly biased estimate of word contexts for the stimulus words; however, the substitution task elicits far more antonyms than can be expected on the basis of actual contextual similarities of antonyms. The collocational study involves no editing and gives statistics on text frequencies regardless of the grammatical class of the forms. In connected discourse, nouns, verbs, indefinite pronouns, determiners, prepositions, auxiliaries, nominative pronouns, and copulas are most frequent, with adjectives and adverbs relatively infrequent. For all stimulus words, except verbs and gerunds, there is a significant positive relation between association and substitution, that is, the use of semantically and grammatically paradigmatic words as associates. Where there is high commonality in substitutions, responses tend to be paradigmatic.

A useful supplement to free-association norms is the additional determination of associations to responses that are elicited on the original test. These supplemental norms increase the number of association hierarchies available to the investigator and also provide information concerning the independent probabilities of chains of words. Free-association responses allow the independent manipulation of associative directionality of pairs of words, for example, A and B, that is, it becomes possible to choose word pairs on the basis of either the A-B or B-A associative strength. Listing of the associative probabilities of other words, given in response to B, can greatly increase the size of the pool of associative triads, that is, A-B-C chains.

Although interpretation of the isolated unit can be influenced by the relative frequency with which the word is used to denote one rather than the other, meaning that only the surrounding context makes clear the intended meaning. Such words that have the same form but more than one meaning are called homonyms. If the two meanings of the word are represented by the same spelling, the word is a homograph. If the two meanings of the word are represented by the same pronunciation, the word is a homophone. A word can be both a homograph and a homophone. Some words are homographs but not homophones. Because homonyms are heavily dependent on context for their interpretation, they provide useful material for studying the modification of verbal meaning as a function of experimental variations in context.","Norms of Word Association",1970,"Yes","studi homograph chapter discuss homograph isol unit ident spell pronunci word clue mean intend interpret isol unit influenc relat frequenc word denot mean surround context make clear intend mean word form mean call homonym mean word repres spell word homograph mean word repres pronunci word homophon word homograph homophon word homograph homophon homonym heavili depend context interpret provid materi studi modif verbal mean function experiment variat context",1

Free-association responses allow the independent manipulation of associative directionality of pairs of words, for example, A and B, that is, it becomes possible to choose word pairs on the basis of either the A-B or B-A associative strength. Listing of the associative probabilities of other words, given in response to B, can greatly increase the size of the pool of associative triads, that is, A-B-C chains. The original norms can be used to discover A-B-C word chains or word pairs varying in degree of bidirectionality. However, such a procedure identifies only a limited number of usable word pairs or chains.",NA,2016,"Yes","norm word associ chapter discuss free associ respons primari purpos respons select palermo jenkin norm supplement free associ norm addit determin associ respons elicit origin test supplement norm increas number associ hierarchi investig provid inform independ probabl chain word free associ respons independ manipul associ direct pair word choos word pair basi associ strength list associ probabl word respons great increas size pool associ triad chain origin norm discov word chain word pair vari degre bidirect procedur identifi limit number usabl word pair chain",1

NA,"creating false memories remembering words not presented in lists","Two experiments (modeled after J. Deese's 1959 study) revealed remarkable levels of false recall and false recognition in a list learning paradigm. In Experiment 1, subjects studied lists of 12 words (e.g., bed, rest, awake); each list was composed of associates of 1 nonpresented word (e.g., sleep). On immediate free recall tests, the nonpresented associates were recalled 40{\%} of the time and were later recognized with high confidence. In Experiment 2, a false recall rate of 55{\%} was obtained with an expanded set of lists, and on a later recognition test, subjects produced false alarms to these items at a rate comparable to the hit rate. The act of recall enhanced later remembering of both studied and nonstudied material. The results reveal a powerful illusion of memory: People remember events that never happened. False memories—either remembering events that never happened, or remembering them quite differently from the way they happened—have recently captured the attention of both psychologists and the public at large. The primary impetus for this recent surge of interest is the increase in the number of cases in which memories of previously unrecognized abuse are reported during the course of therapy. Some researchers have argued that certain therapeutic practices can cause the creation of false memories, and therefore, the apparent ""recovery"" of memories during the course of therapy may actually represent the creation of memories (Lindsay {\&} Read, 1994; Loftus, 1993). Although the concept of false memories is currently enjoying an increase in publicity, it is not new; psychologists have been studying false memories in several laboratory paradigms for years. Schacter (in press) provides an historical overview of the study of memory distortions. Bartlett (1932) is usually credited with conducting the first experimental investigation of false memories; he had subjects read an Indian folktale, ""The War of the Ghosts,"" and recall it repeatedly. Although he reported no aggregate data, but only sample protocols, his results seemed to show distortions in subjects' memories over repeated attempts to recall the story. Interestingly, Bartlett's repeated reproduction results never have been successfully replicated by later researchers (see Gauld {\&} Stephenson, 1967; Roediger, Wheeler, {\&} Rajaram, 1993); indeed, Wheeler and Roediger (1992) showed that recall of prose passages (including ""The War of the Ghosts"") This research was supported by Grant F49620-92-J-0437 from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

A total of 390 Spanish middle and high school students (14-16 years old) and six experts read a narrative or expository text and later summarized it. The results support the viability of developing a computerized assessment tool using human judgments and LSA, although the correlation between human judgments and LSA was higher in the narrative text than in the expository, and LSA correlated more with human content ratings thanwith hu mancoherence ratings.

We present the data of the Dutch Lexicon Project (DLP) in which a group of 39 participants made lexical decisions to 14,000 words and the same number of nonwords. To examine whether the extensive practice precludes comparison with the traditional short experiments, we look at the differences between the first and the last session, compare the results with the English Lexicon Project (ELP) and the French Lexicon Project (FLP), and examine to what extent established findings in Dutch psycholinguistics can be replicated in virtual experiments. Our results show that when good nonwords are used, practice effects are minimal in lexical decision experiments and do not invalidate the behavioral data. For instance, the word frequency curve is the same in DLP as in ELP and FLP. Also, the Dutch-English cognate effect is the same in DLP as in a previously published factorial experiment. This means that large-scale word recognition studies can make use of psychophysical and psychometrical approaches.

There is a sizeable correlation between loadings for the pairs big-little and large-small; nearly all the remaining pairs produce correlations close to zero. Some of the pairs define scales on which it is possible to locate parts of the intraverbal meaning of other adjectives. More than 100 adjectives in the present sample are located on one or more scales produced by the basic contrasts. Not all pairs of contrasts, however, have scalar properties; these words define contrasts but not contrasting scales. Finally, not all adjectives are organized by contrast, though it is probable that a very large number, perhaps the majority, are. Finally evidence is presented for the general linguistic validity of the results of factor analysis of associative meaning. Such evidence points to the determination of intraverbal relations in meaning by partial contextual equivalences plus whatever external contingencies exist between words and the environment at large. {\textcopyright} 1964 Academic Press Inc.

NA,"the 1952 minnesota word association norms","This chapter discusses the 1952 Minnesota word association norms. The Minnesota word association norms are usually known as the Minnesota norms for the Kent–Rosanoff word association test. If the frequency of occurrence of responses to the particular stimulus word is tabulated and then arranged in order of descending frequency, it is customary to describe this series as the associative hierarchy or the associative response hierarchy for the particular stimulus word. There is a general negative relationship between the frequency of popular responses to stimuli and the number of different responses made to the stimuli. The norms have found a wide variety of uses in the experimental laboratory and have also provided a measure of individual differences.

Dialogues between two native speakers of English, between two non-native speakers of English (with either shared or different LIs), and between one native and one non-native speaker of English are included and analyzed in terms of general measures of communicative efficiency.The overall finding was that pairs of native talkers were most efficient, followed by mixed native/non-native pairs and non-native pairs with shared LI. Non-native pairs with different LIs were least efficient.These results support the hypothesis that successful speech communication depends both on the alignment of talkers to the target language and on the alignment of talkers to one another in terms of native language background.","Language and Speech",2010,"Yes","diapix taskforeign accent speechspontan speechtask orient dialoguetyp token ratio wildcat corpus nativ foreign accent english communic effici convers dyad vari languag align profil paper describ develop wildcat corpus nativ foreign accent english corpus script spontan speech record nativ speaker american english nativ speaker english core element corpus set spontan speech record method elicit dialogu base laboratori qualiti speech record develop diapix task dialogu nativ speaker english nativ speaker english share lis nativ nativ speaker english includ analyz term general measur communic effici find pair nativ talker effici mix nativ nativ pair nativ pair share li nativ pair lis effici result support hypothesi success speech communic depend align talker target languag align talker term nativ languag background",1
"Logograph,Mandarin,Megastudy,Nonalphabetic,Reaction time,Visual word recognition","the chinese lexicon project a repository of lexical decision behavioral responses for 2500 chinese characters","The Chinese language has more native speakers than any other language, but research on the reading of Chinese characters is still not as well-developed as it is for the reading of words in alphabetic languages. Two areas notably lacking are the paucity of megastudies in Chinese and the relatively infrequent use of the lexical decision paradigm to investigate single-character recognition. The Chinese Lexicon Project, described in this article, is a database of lexical decision latencies for 2,500 Chinese single characters in simplified script, collected from a sample of native mainland Chinese (Mandarin) speakers (N = 35). This resource will provide a valuable adjunct to influential mega-databases, such as the English, French, and Dutch Lexicon Projects. Using two separate analyses, some advantages associated with megastudies are exemplified. These include the selection of the strongest measure to represent Chinese character frequency (Cai {\&} Brysbaert's (PLoS ONE 5(6): e10729, 2010) subtitle contextual diversity frequency count), and the conducting of virtual studies to replicate and clarify existing findings. The unique morpho-syllabic nature of the Chinese writing system makes it a valuable case study for functional language contrasts. Moreover, this is the first publicly available large-scale repository of behavioral responses pertaining to Chinese language processing (the behavioral dataset is attached to this article, as a supplemental file available for download). For these reasons, the data should be of substantial interest to psychologists, linguists, and other researchers.","Behavior Research Methods",2014,"Yes","logographmandarinmegastudynonalphabeticreact timevisu word recognit chines lexicon project repositori lexic decis behavior respons chines charact chines languag nativ speaker languag research read chines charact develop read word alphabet languag area notabl lack pauciti megastudi chines infrequ lexic decis paradigm investig singl charact recognit chines lexicon project articl databas lexic decis latenc chines singl charact simplifi script collect sampl nativ mainland chines mandarin speaker resourc provid valuabl adjunct influenti mega databas english french dutch lexicon project separ analys advantag megastudi exemplifi includ select strongest measur repres chines charact frequenc cai brysbaert plos e subtitl contextu divers frequenc count conduct virtual studi replic clarifi exist find uniqu morpho syllab natur chines write system make valuabl case studi function languag contrast public larg scale repositori behavior respons pertain chines languag process behavior dataset attach articl supplement file download reason data substanti interest psychologist linguist research",1
NA,"revisiting snodgrass and vanderwarts object pictorial set the role of surface detail in basic level object recognition","Theories of object recognition differ to the extent that they consider object representations as being mediated only by the shape of the object, or shape and surface details, if surface details are part of the representation. In particular, it has been suggested that color information may be helpful at recognizing objects only in very special cases, but not during basic-level object recognition in good viewing conditions. In this study, we collected normative data (naming agreement, familiarity, complexity, and imagery judgments) for Snodgrass and Vanderwart's object database of 260 black-and-white line drawings, and then compared the data to exactly the same shapes but with added gray-level texture and surface details (set 2), and color (set 3). Naming latencies were also recorded. Whereas the addition of texture and shading without color only slightly improved naming agreement scores for the objects, the addition of color information unambiguously improved naming accuracy and speeded correct response times. As shown in previous studies, the advantage provided by color was larger for objects with a diagnostic color, and structurally similar shapes, such as fruits and vegetables, but was also observed for man-made objects with and without a single diagnostic color. These observations show that basic-level 'everyday' object recognition in normal conditions is facilitated by the presence of color information, and support a 'shape + surface' model of object recognition, for which color is an integral part of the object representation. In addition, the new stimuli (sets 2 and 3) and the corresponding normative data provide valuable materials for a wide range of experimental and clinical studies of object recognition.","Perception",2004,"Yes","revisit snodgrass vanderwart object pictori set role surfac detail basic level object recognit theori object recognit differ extent object represent mediat shape object shape surfac detail surfac detail part represent suggest color inform help recogn object special case basic level object recognit good view condit studi collect normat data name agreement familiar complex imageri judgment snodgrass vanderwart object databas black white line draw compar data shape ad gray level textur surfac detail set color set name latenc record addit textur shade color slight improv name agreement score object addit color inform unambigu improv name accuraci speed correct respons time shown previous studi advantag provid color larger object diagnost color structur similar shape fruit veget observ man made object singl diagnost color observ show basic level everyday object recognit normal condit facilit presenc color inform support shape surfac model object recognit color integr part object represent addit stimuli set normat data provid valuabl materi wide rang experiment clinic studi object recognit",1
NA,"phonological encoding in the lexical decision task","In lexical decision experiments, subjects have difficulty in responding NO to non-words which are pronounced exactly like English words (e.g. BRANE). This does not necessarily imply that access to a lexical entry ever occurs via a phono- logical recoding of a visually-presented word. The phonological recoding procedure might be so slow that when the letter string presented is a word, access to its lexical entry via a visual representation is always achieved before phonological recoding is completed. If prelexical phonological recodings are produced by using grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules, such recodings can only occur for words which conform to these rules (regular words), since applications of the rules to words which do not conform to the rules (exception words) produce incorrect phonological representations. In two experiments, it was found that time to achieve lexical access (as measured by YES latency in a lexical decision task) was equivalent for regular words and exception words. It was concluded that access to lexical entries in lexical decision experiments of this sort does not proceed by sometimes or always phonologically recoding visually-presented words.","Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology",1979,"Yes","phonolog encod lexic decis task lexic decis experi subject difficulti respond word pronounc english word brane necessarili impli access lexic entri occur phono logic recod visual present word phonolog recod procedur slow letter string present word access lexic entri visual represent achiev phonolog recod complet prelex phonolog recod produc graphem phonem correspond rule recod occur word conform rule regular word applic rule word conform rule except word produc incorrect phonolog represent experi found time achiev lexic access measur latenc lexic decis task equival regular word except word conclud access lexic entri lexic decis experi sort proceed phonolog recod visual present word",1

Errors showed a systematic relationship to original stimuli. This is held to meet a requirement of the decay theory of immediate memory. The same letter vocabulary was used in a test in which subjects were required to identify the letters spoken against a white noise background. A highly significant correlation was found between letters which confused in the listening test, and letters which confused in recall. The role of neurological noise in recall is discussed in relation to these results. It is further argued that information theory is inadequate to explain the memory span, since the nature of the stimulus set, which can be defined quantitatively, as well as the information per item, is likely to be a determining factor.","British Journal of Psychology",1964,"Yes","acoust confus memori sequenc letter alphabet visual present recal subject error show systemat relationship origin stimuli held meet requir decay theori memori letter vocabulari test subject requir identifi letter spoken white nois background high signific correl found letter confus listen test letter confus recal role neurolog nois recal discuss relat result argu inform theori inadequ explain memori span natur stimulus set defin quantit inform item determin factor",1

NA,"relations among emotion appraisal and emotional action readiness","Ss in 2 studies were asked to report on 32 emotional states. Ss were asked to remember instances of experiencing these states and, for each experience, to fill out a questionnaire on appraisal dimensions and action readiness modes. Appraisal patterns as well as patterns of action readiness show distinct relations to various emotional categories, or names; the contributions of both kinds of components to emotion distinction are in part independent and additive. Multiple correlations, predicting action readiness scores from appraisal scores, demonstrated significant relations between particular modes of action readiness and particular appraisal patterns. The results of these studies are interpreted as providing support for the view that emotions can be regarded both as experiences of forms of appraisal and as states of action readiness. Emotions can profitably be analyzed in terms of sets of components, in which action readiness components take an important share.

Normative ratings for scenes selected for these purposes support the idea that selected clips correspond to the intended target emotion, but studies reporting normative ratings are limited.

Variables hypothesized to affect the perception of stimuli (i.e., gender, race-ethnicity, and familiarity) were also examined. Our analyses generally indicated that males reacted strongly to positively valenced film clips, whereas females reacted more strongly to negatively valenced film clips. Caucasian participants tended to react more strongly to the film clips, and we found some variation by race-ethnicity across target emotions. Finally, familiarity with the films tended to produce higher ratings for positively valenced film clips, and lower ratings for negatively valenced film clips. These findings provide normative ratings for a useful set of film clips for the study of emotion, and they underscore factors to be considered in research that utilizes scenes from film for emotion elicitation.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"Yes","affect dimensionsdiscret emotionsemot elicitationemot filmsgend differencesvalid rate emot film clip film clip wide util elicit emot varieti research studi normat rate scene select purpos support idea select clip correspond intend target emot studi report normat rate limit ethnic divers sampl colleg undergradu select clip rate intens discret valenc arous variabl hypothes affect percept stimuli gender race ethnic familiar examin analys general male react strong posit valenc film clip femal react strong negat valenc film clip caucasian particip tend react strong film clip found variat race ethnic target emot final familiar film tend produc higher rate posit valenc film clip lower rate negat valenc film clip find provid normat rate set film clip studi emot underscor factor consid research util scene film emot elicit",1

In Table 3, in the column ""Lexical Content of the Sentences"" in the ""Incongruent"" row, all five words (“Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness”) should be replaced by “Neutral”.] Research on emotional speech often requires valid stimuli for assessing perceived emotion through prosody and lexical content. To date, no comprehensive emotional speech database for Persian is officially available. The present article reports the process of designing, compiling, and evaluating a comprehensive emotional speech database for colloquial Persian. The database contains a set of 90 validated novel Persian sentences classified in five basic emotional categories (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness), as well as a neutral category. These sentences were validated in two experiments by a group of 1,126 native Persian speakers. The sentences were articulated by two native Persian speakers (one male, one female) in three conditions: (1) congruent (emotional lexical content articulated in a congruent emotional voice), (2) incongruent (neutral sentences articulated in an emotional voice), and (3) baseline (all emotional and neutral sentences articulated in neutral voice). The speech materials comprise about 470 sentences. The validity of the database was evaluated by a group of 34 native speakers in a perception test. Utterances recognized better than five times chance performance (71.4 {\%}) were regarded as valid portrayals of the target emotions. Acoustic analysis of the valid emotional utterances revealed differences in pitch, intensity, and duration, attributes that may help listeners to correctly classify the intended emotion. The database is designed to be used as a reliable material source (for both text and speech) in future cross-cultural or cross-linguistic studies of emotional speech, and it is available for academic research purposes free of charge.

However, few studies exist that have normed the different motor dimensions of the objects; this limits researchers regarding usable stimuli, as well as comparability between studies. In the present study, we normed a set of 560 objects on four motor dimensions: the ease with which they can be grasped, moved, and pantomimed and the number of actions they afford.

Such resources are lacking for Arabic and its dialectal varieties. In the present study, we aimed to provide Tunisian Arabic (TA) normative data for 348 line drawings taken from Cycowicz, Friedman, Rothstein, and Snodgrass (1997), which include Snodgrass and Vanderwart's (1980) 260 pictures. Norms were collected for the following psycholinguistic variables: name agreement, familiarity, subjective frequency, and imageability. Word length data (in numbers of phonemes and syllables) are also listed in the database. We investigated the effects of these variables on word reading in TA. We found that word length and frequency were the best predictors of word-reading latencies in TA. Name agreement was also a significant predictor of word-reading latencies. A particularly interesting finding was that the semantic variables, imageability and familiarity, affected word-reading latencies in TA. Thus, it would seem that TA readers rely on semantics even when reading individual Arabic words that are transparent in terms of orthography-to-phonology mappings.

"Age-of-acquisition,AoA,Estimates,Norms,Ratings","rated age of acquisition norms for over 3200 german words","Words that have been learned early in life are responded to faster than words that have been acquired later. Subjective ratings of acquisition ages have been successfully employed to study the effect of age of acquisition (AoA). Although a large number of norms exist in many languages, fewer are available for German. Therefore, subjective AoA ratings for 3,259 German words were collected online, includ-ing 2,363 nouns and 473 verbs. These words were presented in lists of 140 words, and participants rated the age in years at which they had first learned each word. A split-half correla-tion testified to a high internal reliability. There were also high correlations with rated AoA values for subsets of the items that had been collected in previous studies, in both German and English. Age and gender were found to influence the ratings very weakly, in that older and male participants tended to give slightly higher age ratings. Education, multilingualism, and frequent usage of languages other than German did not exert an influence on the rating values. These new ratings will ex-tend the currently existing norms available for language and reading research across languages and will provide re-searchers with a wider choice of word stimuli. The ratings are available expressed in two measurements: age in years, and AoA rated on a 7-point Likert scale.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","age acquisitionaoaestimatesnormsr rate age acquisit norm german word word learn earli life respond faster word acquir subject rate acquisit age success employ studi effect age acquisit aoa larg number norm exist languag fewer german subject aoa rate german word collect onlin includ ing noun verb word present list word particip rate age year learn word split half correla tion testifi high intern reliabl high correl rate aoa valu subset item collect previous studi german english age gender found influenc rate weak older male particip tend give slight higher age rate educ multilingu frequent usag languag german exert influenc rate valu rate tend exist norm languag read research languag provid searcher wider choic word stimuli rate express measur age year aoa rate point likert scale",1
NA,"a new standardized stimulus set for studying need of help recognition neohelp","This article presents the NeoHelp visual stimulus set created to facilitate investigation of need-of-help recognition with clinical and normative populations of different ages, including children. Need-of-help recognition is one aspect of socioemotional development and a necessary precondition for active helping. The NeoHelp consists of picture pairs showing everyday situations: The first item in a pair depicts a child needing help to achieve a goal; the second one shows the child achieving the goal. Pictures of birds in analogue situations are also included. These control stimuli enable implementation of a human-animal categorization task which serves to separate behavioral correlates specific to need-of-help recognition from general differentiation processes. It is a concern in experimental research to ensure that results do not relate to systematic perceptual differences when comparing responses to categories of different content. Therefore, we not only derived the NeoHelp-pictures within a pair from one another by altering as little as possible, but also assessed their perceptual similarity empirically. We show that NeoHelp-picture pairs are very similar regarding low-level perceptual properties across content categories. We obtained data from 60 children in a broad age range (4 to 13 years) for three different paradigms, in order to assess whether the intended categorization and differentiation could be observed reliably in a normative population. Our results demonstrate that children can differentiate the pictures' content regarding both need-of-help category as well as species as intended in spite of the high perceptual similarities.

NA,"a dataset of metaphors from the italian literature exploring psycholinguistic variables and the role of context","Defining the specific role of the factors that affect metaphor processing is a fundamental step for fully understanding figurative language comprehension, either in discourse and conversation or in reading poems and novels. This study extends the currently available materials on everyday metaphorical expressions by providing the first dataset of metaphors extracted from literary texts and scored for the major psycholinguistic variables, considering also the effect of context. A set of 115 Italian literary metaphors presented in isolation (Experiment 1) and a subset of 65 literary metaphors embedded in their original texts (Experiment 2) were rated on several dimensions (word and phrase frequency, readability, cloze probability, familiarity, concreteness, difficulty and meaningfulness). Overall, literary metaphors scored around medium-low values on all dimensions in both experiments. Collected data were subjected to correlation analysis, which showed the presence of a strong cluster of variables-mainly familiarity, difficulty, and meaningfulness-when literary metaphor were presented in isolation. A weaker cluster was observed when literary metaphors were presented in the original contexts, with familiarity no longer correlating with meaningfulness. Context manipulation influenced familiarity, concreteness and difficulty ratings, which were lower in context than out of context, while meaningfulness increased. Throughout the different dimensions, the literary context seems to promote a global interpretative activity that enhances the open-endedness of the metaphor as a semantic structure constantly open to all possible interpretations intended by the author and driven by the text. This dataset will be useful for the design of future experimental studies both on literary metaphor and on the role of context in figurative meaning, combining ecological validity and aesthetic aspects of language.","PLoS ONE",2014,"Yes","dataset metaphor italian literatur explor psycholinguist variabl role context defin specif role factor affect metaphor process fundament step fulli understand figur languag comprehens discours convers read poem novel studi extend materi everyday metaphor express provid dataset metaphor extract literari text score major psycholinguist variabl effect context set italian literari metaphor present isol experi subset literari metaphor embed origin text experi rate dimens word phrase frequenc readabl cloze probabl familiar concret difficulti meaning literari metaphor score medium low valu dimens experi collect data subject correl analysi show presenc strong cluster variabl familiar difficulti meaning literari metaphor present isol weaker cluster observ literari metaphor present origin context familiar longer correl meaning context manipul influenc familiar concret difficulti rate lower context context meaning increas dimens literari context promot global interpret activ enhanc open ended metaphor semant structur constant open interpret intend author driven text dataset design futur experiment studi literari metaphor role context figur mean combin ecolog valid aesthet aspect languag",1
"Cross-linguistic/dialect differences,Homonyms,Norm reliability,Rating dictionary definitions,Semantic ambiguity","relative meaning frequencies for 578 homonyms in two spanish dialects a cross linguistic extension of the english edom norms","textcopyright} 2015, Psychonomic Society, Inc. Relative meaning frequency is a critical factor to consider in studies of semantic ambiguity. In this work, we examined how this measure may change across the European and Rioplatense dialects of Spanish, as well as how the overall distributional properties differ between Spanish and English, using a computer-assisted norming approach based on dictionary definitions (Armstrong, Tokowicz, {\&} Plaut, 2012). The results showed that the two dialects differ considerably in terms of the relative meaning frequencies of their constituent homonyms, and that the overall distributions of relative frequencies vary considerably across languages, as well. These results highlight the need for localized norms to design powerful studies of semantic ambiguity and suggest that dialectal differences may be responsible for some discrepant effects related to homonymy. In quantifying the reliability of the norms, we also established that as few as seven ratings are needed to converge on a highly stable set of ratings. This approach is therefore a very practical means of acquiring essential data in studies of semantic ambiguity, relative to past approaches, such as those based on the classification of free associates. The norms also present new possibilities for studying semantic ambiguity effects within and between populations who speak one or more languages.

"Backward associative strength (BAS),Deese/Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm,Theme identifiability","normative study of theme identifiability instructions with and without explanation of the false memory effect","False-memory illusions have been widely studied using the Deese/Roediger-McDermott paradigm (DRM). In this paradigm, words semantically related to a single nonpresented critical word are studied. In a later memory test, critical words are often falsely recalled and recognized. The present normative study was conducted to measure the theme identifiability of 60 associative word lists in Spanish that include six words (e.g., stove, coat, blanket, scarf, chill, and bonnet) that are simultaneously associated with three critical words (e.g., HEAT, COLD, and WINTER; Beato {\&} D{\'{i}}ez, Psicothema, 26, 457-463, 2011). Different levels of backward associative strength were used in the construction of the DRM lists. In addition, we used two types of instructions to obtain theme identifiability. In the without-explanation condition, traditional instructions were used, requesting participants to write the theme list. In the with-explanation condition, the false-memory effect and how the lists were built were explained, and an example of a DRM list and critical words was shown. Participants then had to discover the critical words. The results showed that all lists produced theme identifiability. Moreover, some lists had a higher theme identifiability rate (e.g., 61 {\%} for the critical words LOVE, BOYFRIEND, COUPLE) than others (e.g., 24 {\%} for CITY, PLACE, VILLAGE). After comparing the theme identifiabilities in the different conditions, the results indicated higher theme identifiability when the false-memory effect was explained than without such an explanation. Overall, these new normative data provide a useful tool for those experiments that, for example, aim to analyze the wide differences observed in false memory with DRM lists and the role of theme identifiability.","Behavior Research Methods",2016,"Yes","backward associ strength basdeeseroedig mcdermott drm paradigmthem identifi normat studi theme identifi instruct explan fals memori effect fals memori illus wide studi deeseroedig mcdermott paradigm drm paradigm word semant relat singl nonpres critic word studi memori test critic word fals recal recogn present normat studi conduct measur theme identifi associ word list spanish includ word stove coat blanket scarf chill bonnet simultan critic word heat cold winter beato ez psicothema level backward associ strength construct drm list addit type instruct obtain theme identifi explan condit tradit instruct request particip write theme list explan condit fals memori effect list built explain drm list critic word shown particip discov critic word result show list produc theme identifi list higher theme identifi rate critic word love boyfriend coupl citi place villag compar theme identifi condit result higher theme identifi fals memori effect explain explan normat data provid tool experi aim analyz wide differ observ fals memori drm list role theme identifi",1
"Cued recall,Paired-associate learning","recall and response time norms for englishswahili word pairs and facts about kenya","In the vast literature exploring learning, many studies have used paired-associate stimuli, despite the fact that real-world learning involves many different types of information. One of the most popular materials used in studies of learning has been a set of Swahili-English word pairs for which Nelson and Dunlosky (Memory 2; 325-335, 1994) published recall norms two decades ago. These norms involved use of the Swahili words as cues to facilitate recall of the English translation. It is unclear whether cueing in the opposite direction (from English to Swahili) would lead to symmetric recall performance. Bilingual research has suggested that translation in these two different directions involves asymmetric links that may differentially impact recall performance, depending on which language is used as the cue (Kroll {\&} Stewart, Journal of Memory and Language 33; 149-174,1994). Moreover, the norms for these and many other learning stimuli have typically been gathered from college students. In the present study, we report recall accuracy and response time norms for Swahili words when they are cued by their English translations. We also report norms for a companion set of fact stimuli that may be used along with the Swahili-English word pairs to assess learning on a broader scale across different stimulus materials. Data were collected using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to establish a sample that was diverse in both age and ethnicity. These different, but related, stimulus sets will be applicable to studies of learning, metacognition, and memory in diverse samples.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","cu recallpair associ learn recal respons time norm englishswahili word pair fact kenya vast literatur explor learn studi pair associ stimuli fact real world learn involv type inform popular materi studi learn set swahili english word pair nelson dunloski memori publish recal norm decad ago norm involv swahili word cue facilit recal english translat unclear cue opposit direct english swahili lead symmetr recal perform bilingu research suggest translat direct involv asymmetr link differenti impact recal perform depend languag cue kroll stewart journal memori languag norm learn stimuli typic gather colleg student present studi report recal accuraci respons time norm swahili word cu english translat report norm companion set fact stimuli swahili english word pair assess learn broader scale stimulus materi data collect amazon mechan turk establish sampl divers age ethnic relat stimulus set applic studi learn metacognit memori divers sampl",1

"Dynamic faces,ERP,Face database,Stimulus set","a computer generated animated face stimulus set for psychophysiological research","Human faces are fundamentally dynamic, but experimental investigations of face perception have traditionally relied on static images of faces. Although naturalistic videos of actors have been used with success in some contexts, much research in neuroscience and psychophysics demands carefully controlled stimuli. In this article, we describe a novel set of computer-generated, dynamic face stimuli. These grayscale faces are tightly controlled for low- and high-level visual properties. All faces are standardized in terms of size, luminance, location, and the size of facial features. Each face begins with a neutral pose and transitions to an expression over the course of 30 frames. Altogether, 222 stimuli were created, spanning three different categories of movement: (1) an affective movement (fearful face), (2) a neutral movement (close-lipped, puffed cheeks with open eyes), and (3) a biologically impossible movement (upward dislocation of eyes and mouth). To determine whether early brain responses sensitive to low-level visual features differed between the expressions, we measured the occipital P100 event-related potential, which is known to reflect differences in early stages of visual processing, and the N170, which reflects structural encoding of faces. We found no differences between the faces at the P100, indicating that different face categories were well matched on low-level image properties. This database provides researchers with a well-controlled set of dynamic faces, controlled for low-level image characteristics, that are applicable to a range of research questions in social perception.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"Yes","dynam faceserpfac databasestimulus set comput generat anim face stimulus set psychophysiolog research human face fundament dynam experiment investig face percept tradit reli static imag face naturalist video actor success context research neurosci psychophys demand care control stimuli articl describ set comput generat dynam face stimuli grayscal face tight control low high level visual properti face standard term size lumin locat size facial featur face begin neutral pose transit express frame altogeth stimuli creat span categori movement affect movement fear face neutral movement close lip puf cheek open eye biolog imposs movement upward disloc eye mouth determin earli brain respons sensit low level visual featur differ express measur occipit p event relat potenti reflect differ earli stage visual process n reflect structur encod face found differ face p indic face categori match low level imag properti databas research control set dynam face control low level imag characterist applic rang research question social percept",1

Norms are presented for name agreement, familiarity, imageability, rated and objective age-of-acquisition (AoA) of vocabulary, and word frequency. The ratings were collected from 103 adult participants while the objective AoA values were collected from 279 children, 2.5-11 years of age. The present norms are in many respects similar to those already collected for other language groups indicating that the stimuli will be useful for further psychological studies in Iceland. The rated AoA values show a high correlation with objective AoA (r = 0.718) thus confirming previous studies conducted with English speaking participants that rated AoA is a relatively valid measure of objective AoA. However, word frequency and familiarity are more closely correlated with rated AoA than with objective AoA indicating that these factors play some role in the ratings. Objective AoA norms are therefore to be preferred in studies of cognitive processes.","Scandinavian Journal of Psychology",2000,"Yes","age acquisitionicelandicimageabilitypictur normsword frequenc iceland norm snodgrass vanderwart pictur imag agreement familiar age acquisit paper present iceland norm wide pictori stimuli snodgrass vanderwart norm present agreement familiar imag rate object age acquisit aoa vocabulari word frequenc rate collect adult particip object aoa valu collect children year age present norm respect similar collect languag group indic stimuli psycholog studi iceland rate aoa valu show high correl object aoa confirm previous studi conduct english speak particip rate aoa valid measur object aoa word frequenc familiar close correl rate aoa object aoa indic factor play role rate object aoa norm prefer studi cognit process",1

For these properties, we also obtained frequency, saliency, and connotativeness scores (i.e., how much the properties deviated from the denotative or literal meaning). In addition, we examined whether expression type (metaphor vs. simile) impacted the interpretations produced. We found that metaphors activated more salient properties than did similes, but the connotativeness levels for metaphor and simile salient properties were similar. Also, the two types of expressions did not differ across a wide range of measures collected: aptness, conventionality, familiarity, and interpretive diversity scores. Combined with the property lists, these interpretation norms constitute a thorough collection of data about metaphors and similes, employing the same topic-vehicle words, which can be used in psycholinguistic and cognitive neuroscience studies to investigate how the two types of expressions are represented and processed.

The present article provides a comparison of the norms obtained in Brazil and internationally. The pattern of correlations among the Brazilian and other standardizations were equivalent to that previously observed: despite pictures being judged to be of similar familiarity and visual complexity (high positive correlations), name agreement was less correlated, possibly due to differences in the languages spoken in each country and/or in the sample size used in each study.

"ASL,Age of acquisition,Lexical frequency,Psycholinguistics,Sign language,Subjective frequency","subjective frequency ratings for 432 asl signs","Given the importance of lexical frequency for psycholinguistic research and the lack of comprehensive frequency data for sign languages, we collected subjective estimates of lexical frequency for 432 signs in American Sign Language (ASL). Our participants were 59 deaf signers who first began to acquire ASL at ages ranging from birth to 14 years old and who had a minimum of 10 years of experience. Subjective frequency estimates were made on a scale ranging from 1 = rarely see the sign to 7 = always see the sign. The mean subjective frequency ratings for individual signs did not vary in relation to age of sign language exposure (AoLE), chronological age, or length of ASL experience. Nor did AoLE show significant effects on the response times (RTs) for making the ratings. However, RTs were highly correlated with mean frequency ratings. These results suggest that the distributions of subjective lexical frequencies are consistent across signers with varying AoLEs. The implications for research practice are that subjective frequency ratings from random samples of highly experienced deaf signers can provide a reasonable measure of lexical control in sign language experiments. The Appendix gives the mean and median subjective frequency ratings and the mean and median log(RT) of the ASL signs for the entire sample; the supplemental material gives these measures for the three AoLE groups: native, early, and late.","Behavior Research Methods",2014,"Yes","aslag acquisitionlex frequencypsycholinguisticssign languagesubject frequenc subject frequenc rate asl sign import lexic frequenc psycholinguist research lack comprehens frequenc data sign languag collect subject estim lexic frequenc sign american sign languag asl particip deaf signer began acquir asl age rang birth year minimum year experi subject frequenc estim made scale rang rare sign sign subject frequenc rate individu sign vari relat age sign languag exposur aol chronolog age length asl experi aol show signific effect respons time rts make rate rts high correl frequenc rate result suggest distribut subject lexic frequenc consist signer vari aol implic research practic subject frequenc rate random sampl high experienc deaf signer provid reason measur lexic control sign languag experi appendix median subject frequenc rate median logrt asl sign entir sampl supplement materi measur aol group nativ earli late",1

This corpus of CVCs, provided as supplementary materials, was analyzed to address the following questions: (1) Do computations based on a child corpus differ from those based on an adult corpus? (2) Do the phonotactic probability and/or the neighborhood density of real words differ from those of nonwords? (3) Do phonotactic probability and/or neighborhood density differ across CVCs that vary in consonant age of acquisition? The results showed significant differences in phonotactic probability and neighborhood density for the child versus adult corpora, replicating prior findings. The impact of this difference on future studies will depend on the level of precision needed when specifying probability and density.

NA,"affective norms for french words fan","The present study provides affective norms for a large corpus of French words (N = 1,031) that were rated on emotional valence and emotional arousal by 469 French young adults. Ratings were made using the Self-Assessment Manikin (Lang, 1980). By combining evaluations of valence and arousal, and including ratings provided by male and female young adults, this database complements and extends existing French-language databases. The response reliability for the two affective dimensions was good, and the consistency between the present and previous ratings was high. We found a strong quadratic relationship between the valence and arousal ratings. Perceptions of the affective content of a word were partly linked to sex. This new affective database (FAN) will enable French-speaking researchers to select suitable materials for studies of how the character of affective words influences their cognitive processing.

Ratings were obtained from 117 Dutch participants. Word frequency was determined on the basis of the SUBTLEX-NL corpus (Keuleers, Brysbaert, {\&} New, Behavior Research Methods, 42, 643-650, 2010). For 104 of the pictures, naming latencies and name agreement were determined in a separate naming experiment with 74 native speakers of Dutch. The Dutch norms closely corresponded to the norms for British English. Multiple regression analysis showed that age of acquisition, imageability, image agreement, visual complexity, and name agreement were significant predictors of naming latencies, whereas word frequency and word length were not. Combined with the results of a principal-component analysis, these findings suggest that variables influencing the processes of conceptual preparation and lexical selection affect latencies more strongly than do variables influencing word-form encoding.","Behavior Research Methods",2014,"Yes","action namingag acquisitionimag agreementimag agreementvisu complex predict name latenc action pictur dutch norm present studi dutch norm age acquisit familiar imag imag agreement visual complex word frequenc word length syllabl line draw action rate obtain dutch particip word frequenc determin basi subtlex nl corpus keuleer brysbaert behavior research method pictur name latenc agreement determin separ name experi nativ speaker dutch dutch norm close correspond norm british english multipl regress analysi show age acquisit imag imag agreement visual complex agreement signific predictor name latenc word frequenc word length combin result princip compon analysi find suggest variabl influenc process conceptu prepar lexic select affect latenc strong variabl influenc word form encod",1

"Concreteness,Familiarity,Normative ratings,Semantic norms,Semantic similarity","semantic similarity normative ratings for 185 spanish noun triplets","The present study introduces the first Spanish database with normative ratings of semantic similarity for 185 word triplets. Each word triplet is constituted by a target word (e.g., guisante [pea]) and two semantically related and nonassociatively related words: a word highly related in meaning to the target (e.g., jud{\'{i}}a [bean]), and a word less related in meaning to the target (e.g., patata [potato]). The degree of meaning similarity was assessed by 332 participants by using a semantic similarity rating task on a 9-point scale. Pairs having a value of semantic similarity ranging from 5 to 9 were classified as being more semantically related, whereas those with values ranging from 2 to 4.99 were considered as being less semantically related. The relative distance between the two pairs for the same target ranged from 0.48 to 5.07 points. Mean comparisons revealed that participants rated the more similar words as being significantly more similar in meaning to the target word than were the less similar words. In addition to the semantic similarity norms, values of concreteness and familiarity of each word in a triplet are provided. The present database can be a very useful tool for scientists interested in designing experiments to examine the role of semantics in language processing. Since the variable of semantic similarity includes a wide range of values, it can be used as either a continuous or a dichotomous variable.

Today, many researchers focus exclusively on two-dimensional models involving valence and arousal. Adopting a theoretically based approach, we show for three languages that four dimensions are needed to satisfactorily represent similarities and differences in the meaning of emotion words. In order of importance, these dimensions are evaluation-pleasantness, potency-control, activation-arousal, and unpredictability. They were identified on the basis of the applicability of 144 features representing the six components of emotions: (a) appraisals of events, (b) psychophysiological changes, (c) motor expressions, (d) action tendencies, (e) subjective experiences, and (f) emotion regulation.","Psychological Science",2007,"Yes","world emot dimension half centuri emot research attempt establish dimension space econom account similar differ emot experi today research focus exclus dimension model involv valenc arous adopt theoret base approach show languag dimens need satisfactorili repres similar differ mean emot word order import dimens evalu pleasant potenc control activ arous unpredict identifi basi applic featur repres compon emot apprais event psychophysiolog motor express action tendenc subject experi emot regul",1

Young adults (aged 21–30 yrs) and older adults (aged 66–81 yrs) responded to 90 words in a discrete word association task. An associative frequency measure was calculated by counting how many participants produced a particular word and then converting this number into a proportion. The degree of overlap between the cohorts in terms of dominant responses, the responses with the highest association frequencies, was moderate. Dominant responses were common to the two cohorts for only 36 of the 90 items. When the top three responses were considered the degree of overlap increased to approximately 60{\%}. Four measures of response heterogeneity were calculated for each stimulus item. Comparison of the responses of the younger and older adults indicates that there was less response heterogeneity amongst the older cohort.

NA,"what is this thing called frequency","When researchers are interested in the influence of long-term knowledge on performance, printed word frequency is typically the variable of choice. Despite this preference, we know little about what frequency norms measure. They ostensibly index how often and how recently words are experienced, but words appear in context, so frequency potentially reflects an influence of connections with other words. This paper presents the results of a large free association study as well as the results of experiments designed to evaluate the hypothesis that common words have stronger connections to other words. The norms indicate that common words tend to be more concrete but they do not appear to have more associates, stronger associates, or more connections among their associates. Two extralist cued recall experiments showed that, with other attributes being equal, high- and low-frequency words were equally effective as test cues. These results suggest that frequency does not achieve its effects because of stronger or greater numbers of connections to other words, as implied in SAM. Other results indicated that common words have more connections from other words, including their associates, and that free association provides a valid index of associative strength.","Memory {\&} Cognition",2000,"Yes","thing call frequenc research interest influenc long term knowledg perform print word frequenc typic variabl choic prefer frequenc norm measur ostens index recent word experienc word context frequenc potenti reflect influenc connect word paper present result larg free associ studi result experi design evalu hypothesi common word stronger connect word norm common word tend concret associ stronger associ connect associ extralist cu recal experi show attribut equal high low frequenc word equal effect test cue result suggest frequenc achiev effect stronger greater number connect word impli sam result common word connect word includ associ free associ valid index associ strength",1

We elaborated the materials by following a series of specific steps. First, we tested the valence of a set of written pseudowords generated by specific software. Two Italian actors (male and female) then recorded the resulting subset of linguistically legal and neutral pseudowords in three emotional tones. Finally, on the basis of the results of independent ratings of emotional intensity, we selected a set of 30 audio stimuli expressed in each of the three different emotions. Acoustic analyses indicated that the prosodic indexes of fundamental frequency, vocal intensity, and speech rate anchored individual perceptions of the emotions expressed. Finally, the acoustic profile of the set of emotional stimuli confirmed previous findings. The happy tone stimuli showed high f0 values, high intensity, high pitch variability, and a faster speech rate. The angry tone stimuli were also characterized by high f0 and intensity, but by relatively smaller pitch variability and a lower speech rate.

NA,"test based age of acquisition norms for 44 thousand english word meanings","Age of acquisition (AoA) is an important variable in word recognition research. Up to now, nearly all psychology researchers examining the AoA effect have used ratings obtained from adult participants. An alternative basis for determining AoA is directly testing children's knowledge of word meanings at various ages. In educational research, scholars and teachers have tried to establish the grade at which particular words should be taught by examining the ages at which children know various word meanings. Such a list is available from Dale and O'Rourke's (1981) Living Word Vocabulary for nearly 44 thousand meanings coming from over 31 thousand unique word forms and multiword expressions. The present article relates these test-based AoA estimates to lexical decision times as well as to AoA adult ratings, and reports strong correlations between all of the measures. Therefore, test-based estimates of AoA can be used as an alternative measure.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","test base age acquisit norm thousand english word mean age acquisit aoa import variabl word recognit research psycholog research examin aoa effect rate obtain adult particip altern basi determin aoa direct test children knowledg word mean age educ research scholar teacher establish grade word taught examin age children word mean list dale rourk live word vocabulari thousand mean come thousand uniqu word form multiword express present articl relat test base aoa estim lexic decis time aoa adult rate report strong correl measur test base estim aoa altern measur",1
NA,"going to town large scale norming and statistical analysis of 870 american english idioms","An idiom is classically defined as a formulaic sequence whose meaning is comprised of more than the sum of its parts. For this reason, idioms pose a unique problem for models of sentence processing, as researchers must take into account how idioms vary and along what dimensions, as these factors can modulate the ease with which an idiomatic interpretation can be activated. In order to help ensure external validity and comparability across studies, idiom research benefits from the availability of publicly available resources reporting ratings from a large number of native speakers. Resources such as the one outlined in the current paper facilitate opportunities for consensus across studies on idiom processing and help to further our goals as a research community. To this end, descriptive norms were obtained for 870 American English idioms from 2,100 participants along five dimensions: familiarity, meaningfulness, literal plausibility, global decomposability, and predictability. Idiom familiarity and meaningfulness strongly correlated with one another, whereas familiarity and meaningfulness were positively correlated with both global decomposability and predictability.

However, the exchange of experimental material has not taken advantage of this progress yet. In order to facilitate access to experimental material, the Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS) project was created as a free standardized set of visual stimuli accessible to all researchers, through a normative database. The BOSS is currently the largest existing photo bank providing norms for more than 15 dimensions (e.g. familiarity, visual complexity, manipulability, etc.), making the BOSS an extremely useful research tool and a mean to homogenize scientific data worldwide. The first phase of the BOSS was completed in 2010, and contained 538 normative photos. The second phase of the BOSS project presented in this article, builds on the previous phase by adding 930 new normative photo stimuli. New categories of concepts were introduced, including animals, building infrastructures, body parts, and vehicles and the number of photos in other categories was increased. All new photos of the BOSS were normalized relative to their name, familiarity, visual complexity, object agreement, viewpoint agreement, and manipulability.

The goals of the present paper are two-fold: (1) to introduce CLEARPOND (Cross-Linguistic Easy-Access Resource for Phonological and Orthographic Neighborhood Densities), a centralized database of phonological and orthographic neighborhood information, both within and between languages, for five commonly-studied languages: Dutch, English, French, German, and Spanish; and (2) to show how CLEARPOND can be used to compare general properties of phonological and orthographic neighborhoods across languages. CLEARPOND allows researchers to input a word or list of words and obtain phonological and orthographic neighbors, neighborhood densities, mean neighborhood frequencies, word lengths by number of phonemes and graphemes, and spoken-word frequencies. Neighbors can be defined by substitution, deletion, and/or addition, and the database can be queried separately along each metric or summed across all three. Neighborhood values can be obtained both within and across languages, and outputs can optionally be restricted to neighbors of higher frequency. To enable researchers to more quickly and easily develop stimuli, CLEARPOND can also be searched by features, generating lists of words that meet precise criteria, such as a specific range of neighborhood sizes, lexical frequencies, and/or word lengths.

NA,"ratings for welsh words and their english equivalents","The rating of English words and their Welsh equivalents provided the opportunity to compare subjective ratings in two languages as well as the opportunity to compare ratings in a deep and a shallow orthography (English and Welsh, respectively). Four variables—age of acquisition (AOA), familiarity, concreteness, and imageability—were rated. AOA and imageability emerged as the two most important extralingual variables (r=.8 and .73, respectively). Although the patterns of ratings were generally consistent within and between languages, some differences did emerge when these patterns were compared with those from other studies. Using similar instructions to rate familiarity and AOA resulted in a low correlation in English (r=2.5) and a high correlation in Welsh (r=2.84). The mean ratings for familiarity, concreteness, and imageability were higher in Welsh than in English (5.23 vs. 3.35, 5.46 vs. 4.41, and 5.29 vs. 4.38, respectively).

NA,"scegram an image database for semantic and syntactic inconsistencies in scenes","Our visual environment is not random, but follows compositional rules according to what objects are usually found where. Despite the growing interest in how such semantic and syntactic rules - a scene grammar - enable effective attentional guidance and object perception, no common image database containing highly-controlled object-scene modifications has been publically available. Such a database is essential in minimizing the risk that low-level features drive high-level effects of interest, which is being discussed as possible source of controversial study results. To generate the first database of this kind - SCEGRAM - we took photographs of 62 real-world indoor scenes in six consistency conditions that contain semantic and syntactic (both mild and extreme) violations as well as their combinations. Importantly, always two scenes were paired, so that an object was semantically consistent in one scene (e.g., ketchup in kitchen) and inconsistent in the other (e.g., ketchup in bathroom). Low-level salience did not differ between object-scene conditions and was generally moderate. Additionally, SCEGRAM contains consistency ratings for every object-scene condition, as well as object-absent scenes and object-only images. Finally, a cross-validation using eye-movements replicated previous results of longer dwell times for both semantic and syntactic inconsistencies compared to consistent controls. In sum, the SCEGRAM image database is the first to contain well-controlled semantic and syntactic object-scene inconsistencies that can be used in a broad range of cognitive paradigms (e.g., verbal and pictorial priming, change detection, object identification, etc.) including paradigms addressing developmental aspects of scene grammar.

NA,"affective meanings of 1469 bengali concepts","This article provides semantic differential ratings of 1,469 concepts in Bengali, a language spoken by about 250 million individuals in eastern India and Bangladesh. These data were collected from 20 male and 20 female Calcutta respondents who rated stimuli on three culturally universal affective dimensions: evaluation–potency–activity (EPA). This study employs pan-respondent component analyses as a means of examining the respondents' usage of the standard EPA scales. The pan-respondent component analyses indicate that some respondents used the rating scales in unexpected ways, recording their feelings about one component of concepts' EPA with ratings on a scale intended to measure a different dimension. When scores were based only on respondents who used the scales appropriately, several interesting patterns were found. For respondents of both genders, potency scores have a curvilinear relation with evaluation, such that very good and very bad concepts are mostly seen as very potent, whereas evaluatively neutral concepts are seen as somewhat impotent or just slightly potent. A moderate linear correlation exists between activity and evaluation, and a modest positive relation exists between potency and activity. Gender correlations are high on evaluation, .93, but much lower for potency scores, with a correlation of .55, and even lower for activity, .30. In this article we examine several explanations for why scales denoting potency and activity were reinterpreted as indicating goodness by certain respondents, and consider the matter of including data collected from respondents who used scales in this way.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","affect mean bengali concept articl semant differenti rate concept bengali languag spoken million individu eastern india bangladesh data collect male femal calcutta respond rate stimuli cultur univers affect dimens evalu potenc activ epa studi employ pan respond compon analys mean examin respond usag standard epa scale pan respond compon analys respond rate scale unexpect way record feel compon concept epa rate scale intend measur dimens score base respond scale appropri interest pattern found respond gender potenc score curvilinear relat evalu good bad concept potent evalu neutral concept impot slight potent moder linear correl exist activ evalu modest posit relat exist potenc activ gender correl high evalu lower potenc score correl lower activ articl examin explan scale denot potenc activ reinterpret indic good respond matter includ data collect respond scale",1

Good response reliability was observed in each of the four age groups. Despite a significant level of consensus, we found age differences in both the valence and arousal ratings: Seven- and 9-year-old children gave higher mean valence and arousal ratings than did the other age groups. Moreover, the tendency to judge words positively (i.e., positive bias) decreased with age.

In this article, we provide normative data for a set of Bulgarian idioms and their English translations, and by doing so replicate in a Slavic language the relationships between the ratings previously found in Romance and Germanic languages. Additionally, we compared whether collecting these types of ratings in between-subjects or within-subjects designs affects the data and the conclusions drawn, and found no evidence that design type affects the final outcome. Finally, we present the results of a meta-analysis that summarizes the relationships found across the literature. As in many previous individual studies, we found that familiarity correlates with a number of other features; however, such studies have shown conflicting results concerning literality and decomposability ratings. The meta-analysis revealed reliable relationships of decomposability with a number of other measures, such as familiarity, meaning, and predictability. Conversely, literality was shown to have little to no relationship with any of the other subjective ratings.

Norming datasets for these instruments, which provide the basis for standardized comparisons of individual children to a population, can also be used to derive norms for the acquisition of individual words in production and comprehension and also early gestures and symbolic actions. These lexical norms have a wide range of uses in basic research, assessment and intervention. In addition, cross-linguistic comparisons of lexical development are greatly facilitated by the availability of norms from diverse languages. This report describes the development of CLEX, a new web-based cross-linguistic database for lexical data from adaptations of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories. CLEX provides tools for a range of analyses within and across languages. It is designed to incorporate additional language datasets easily, and to permit users to define mappings between lexical items in pairs of languages for more specific cross-linguistic comparisons.","Journal of Child Language",2010,"Yes","clex cross linguist lexic norm databas parent report proven valid cost effect mean evalu earli child languag norm dataset instrument provid basi standard comparison individu children popul deriv norm acquisit individu word product comprehens earli gestur symbol action lexic norm wide rang basic research assess intervent addit cross linguist comparison lexic develop great facilit avail norm divers languag report describ develop clex web base cross linguist databas lexic data adapt macarthur bate communic develop inventori clex tool rang analys languag design incorpor addit languag dataset easili permit user defin map lexic item pair languag specif cross linguist comparison",1

NA,"a database of 629 english compound words ratings of familiarity lexeme meaning dominance semantic transparency age of acquisition imageability and sensory experience","Since the work of Taft and Forster (1976), a growing literature has examined how English compound words are recognized and organized in the mental lexicon. Much of this research has focused on whether compound words are decomposed during recognition by manipulating the word frequencies of their lexemes. However, many variables may impact morphological processing, including relational semantic variables such as semantic transparency, as well as additional form-related and semantic variables. In the present study, ratings were collected on 629 English compound words for six variables [familiarity, age of acquisition (AoA), semantic transparency, lexeme meaning dominance (LMD), imageability, and sensory experience ratings (SER)]. All of the compound words selected for this study are contained within the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007), which made it possible to use a regression approach to examine the predictive power of these variables for lexical decision and word naming performance. Analyses indicated that familiarity, AoA, imageability, and SER were all significant predictors of both lexical decision and word naming performance when they were added separately to a model containing the length and frequency of the compounds, as well as the lexeme frequencies. In addition, rated semantic transparency also predicted lexical decision performance. The database of English compound words should be beneficial to word recognition researchers who are interested in selecting items for experiments on compound words, and it will also allow researchers to conduct further analyses using the available data combined with word recognition times included in the English Lexicon Project.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"Yes","databas english compound word rate familiar lexem mean domin semant transpar age acquisit imag sensori experi work taft forster grow literatur examin english compound word recogn organ mental lexicon research focus compound word decompos recognit manipul word frequenc lexem variabl impact morpholog process includ relat semant variabl semant transpar addit form relat semant variabl present studi rate collect english compound word variabl familiar age acquisit aoa semant transpar lexem mean domin lmd imag sensori experi rate ser compound word select studi contain english lexicon project balota al made regress approach examin predict power variabl lexic decis word name perform analys familiar aoa imag ser signific predictor lexic decis word name perform ad separ model length frequenc compound lexem frequenc addit rate semant transpar predict lexic decis perform databas english compound word benefici word recognit research interest select item experi compound word research conduct analys data combin word recognit time includ english lexicon project",1

This is a first attempt at creating affective norms for Polish words. The norms are based on ratings by a total of 1,670 college students (852 females and 818 males) from different Warsaw universities and academies, studying various disciplines in equal proportions (humanities, engineering, and social and natural sciences) using a 9-point Likert Self-Assessment Manikin scale. Each participant assessed 240 words on six different scales (40 words per scale) using a paper-and-pencil group survey procedure. These affective norms for Polish words are a valid and useful tool that will allow researchers to use standard, well-known verbal materials comparable to the materials used in other languages (English, German, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch, etc.).

This article examines the reliability of the ANPST and the impact of population type and sex on affective ratings. The ANPST dataset was introduced to provide a recognized method of eliciting affective states with linguistic stimuli more complex than single words and that included contextual information and thus are less ambiguous in interpretation than single word. Analysis of the properties of the ANPST dataset showed that norms collected are reliable in terms of split-half estimation and that the distributions of ratings are similar to those obtained in other affective norms studies. The pattern of correlations was the same as that found in analysis of an affective norms dataset for words based on the same six variables. Female psychology students' valence ratings were also more polarized than those of their female student peers studying other subjects, but arousal ratings were only higher for negative words. Differences also appeared for all other measured dimensions. Women's valence ratings were found to be more polarized and arousal ratings were higher than those made by men, and differences were also present for dominance, origin, and subjective significance.

The objects' novelty was confirmed by both self-report and a lack of consensus on questions that required participants to name and identify the objects. We also found that object novelty correlated with qualifying naming responses pertaining to the objects' colors. The results from a similarity sorting task (and a subsequent multidimensional scaling analysis on the similarity ratings) demonstrated that the objects are complex and distinct entities that vary along several featural dimensions beyond simply shape and color.

NA,"mm mds a multidimensional scaling database with similarity ratings for 240 object categories from the massive memory picture database","Cognitive theories in visual attention and perception, categorization, and memory often critically rely on concepts of similarity among objects, and empirically require measures of “sameness” among their stimuli. For instance, a researcher may require similarity estimates among multiple exemplars of a target category in visual search, or targets and lures in recognition memory. Quantifying similarity, however, is challenging when everyday items are the desired stimulus set, particularly when researchers require several different pictures from the same category. In this article, we document a new multidimensional scaling database with similarity ratings for 240 categories, each containing color photographs of 16–17 exemplar objects. We collected similarity ratings using the spatial arrangement method. Reports include: the multidimensional scaling solutions for each category, up to five dimensions, stress and fit measures, coordinate locations for each stimulus, and two new classifications. For each picture, we categorized the item's prototypicality, indexed by its proximity to other items in the space. We also classified pairs of images along a continuum of similarity, by assessing the overall arrangement of each MDS space. These similarity ratings will be useful to any researcher that wishes to control the similarity of experimental stimuli according to an objective quantification of “sameness.”","PLoS ONE",2014,"Yes","mm mds multidimension scale databas similar rate object categori massiv memori pictur databas cognit theori visual attent percept categor memori critic reli concept similar object empir requir measur same stimuli instanc research requir similar estim multipl exemplar target categori visual search target lure recognit memori quantifi similar challeng everyday item desir stimulus set research requir pictur categori articl document multidimension scale databas similar rate categori color photograph exemplar object collect similar rate spatial arrang method report includ multidimension scale solut categori dimens stress fit measur coordin locat stimulus classif pictur categor item prototyp index proxim item space classifi pair imag continuum similar assess arrang mds space similar rate research wish control similar experiment stimuli object quantif same",1

Adult native speakers reported the age at which they had learned each word. We present a comparison of the AoA ratings across all languages by contrasting them in pairs. This comparison shows a consistency in the orders of ratings across the 25 languages. The data were then analyzed (1) to ascertain how the demographic characteristics of the participants influenced AoA estimations and (2) to assess differences caused by the exact form of the target question (when did you learn vs. when do children learn this word); (3) to compare the ratings obtained in our study to those of previous studies; and (4) to assess the validity of our study by comparison with quasi-objective AoA norms derived from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI). All 299 words were judged as being acquired early (mostly before the age of 6 years). AoA ratings were associated with the raters' social or language status, but not with the raters' age or education. Parents reported words as being learned earlier, and bilinguals reported learning them later. Estimations of the age at which children learn the words revealed significantly lower ratings of AoA. Finally, comparisons with previous AoA and MB-CDI norms support the validity of the present estimations.

In the last ten years, a number of lexical databases have been developed for Greek. However, these lack important part-of-speech information. Furthermore, the need for alternative procedures for calculating syllabic measurements and stress information, as well as combination of several metrics to investigate linguistic properties of the Greek language are highlighted. To address these issues, we present a new extensive lexical database of Modern Greek (GreekLex 2) with part-of-speech information for each word and accurate syllabification and orthographic information predictive of stress, as well as several measurements of word similarity and phonetic information. The addition of detailed statistical information about Greek part-of-speech, syllabification, and stress neighbourhood allowed novel analyses of stress distribution within different grammatical categories and syllabic lengths to be carried out. Results showed that the statistical preponderance of stress position on the pre-final syllable that is reported for Greek language is dependent upon grammatical category. Additionally, analyses showed that a proportion higher than 90{\%} of the tokens in the database would be stressed correctly solely by relying on stress neighbourhood information.

NA,"descriptive norms for 350 chinese idioms with seven syntactic structures","The most important forms of idioms in Chinese, chengyus (CYs), have a fixed length of four Chinese characters. Most CYs are joined structures of two, two-character words—subject–verb units (SVs), verb–object units (VOs), structures of modification (SMs), or verb–verb units—or of four, one-character words. Both the first and second pairs of words in a four-word CY form an SV, a VO, or an SM. In the present study, normative measures were obtained for knowledge, familiarity, subjective frequency, age of acquisition, predictability, literality, and compositionality for 350 CYs, and the influences of the CYs' syntactic structures on the descriptive norms were analyzed. Consistent with previous studies, all of the norms yielded a high reliability, and there were strong correlations between knowledge, familiarity, subjective frequency, and age of acquisition, and between familiarity and predictability. Unlike in previous studies (e.g., Libben {\&} Titone in Memory {\&} Cognition, 36, 1103–1121, 2008), however, we observed a strong correlation between literality and compositionality. In general, the results seem to support a hybrid view of idiom representation and comprehension. According to the evaluation scores, we further concluded that CYs consisting of just one SM are less likely to be decomposable than those with a VOVO composition, and also less likely to be recognized through their constituent words, or to be familiar to, known by, or encountered by users. CYs with an SMSM composition are less likely than VOVO CYs to be decomposable or to be known or encountered by users.

NA,"a coding system with independent annotations of gesture forms and functions during verbal communication development of a database of speech and gesture dosage","Gestures are commonly used together with spoken language in human communication. One major limitation of gesture investigations in the existing literature lies in the fact that the coding of forms and functions of gestures has not been clearly differentiated. This paper first described a recently developed Database of Speech and GEsture (DoSaGE) based on independent annotation of gesture forms and functions among 119 neurologically unimpaired right-handed native speakers of Cantonese (divided into three age and two education levels), and presented findings of an investigation examining how gesture use was related to age and linguistic performance. Consideration of these two factors, for which normative data are currently very limited or lacking in the literature, is relevant and necessary when one evaluates gesture employment among individuals with and without language impairment. Three speech tasks, including monologue of a personally important event, sequential description, and story-telling, were used for elicitation. The EUDICO Linguistic ANnotator (ELAN) software was used to independently annotate each participant's linguistic information of the transcript, forms of gestures used, and the function for each gesture. About one-third of the subjects did not use any co-verbal gestures. While the majority of gestures were non-content-carrying, which functioned mainly for reinforcing speech intonation or controlling speech flow, the content-carrying ones were used to enhance speech content. Furthermore, individuals who are younger or linguistically more proficient tended to use fewer gestures, suggesting that normal speakers gesture differently as a function of age and linguistic performance.","Journal of Nonverbal Behavior",2015,"Yes","code system independ annot gestur form function verbal communic develop databas speech gestur dosag gestur common spoken languag human communic major limit gestur investig exist literatur lie fact code form function gestur differenti paper recent develop databas speech gestur dosag base independ annot gestur form function neurolog unimpair hand nativ speaker cantones divid age educ level present find investig examin gestur relat age linguist perform consider factor normat data limit lack literatur relev evalu gestur employ individu languag impair speech task includ monologu person import event sequenti descript stori tell elicit eudico linguist annot elan softwar independ annot particip linguist inform transcript form gestur function gestur subject verbal gestur major gestur content carri function reinforc speech inton control speech flow content carri enhanc speech content individu younger linguist profici tend fewer gestur suggest normal speaker gestur differ function age linguist perform",1

NA,"silex a database for silent letter endings in french words","Silent-letter endings are often claimed to be a major source of inconsistency in the French orthography. In this report, we introduce Silex, a database designed to facilitate the study of spelling performance in general, and silent-letter endings in particular. It was derived from two large and recent corpora based on child- and adult-targeted material. Silex consists of three kinds of Excel workbooks: a set of Stimuli Selector workbooks that allow researchers to select words based on a variety of statistics and word characteristics; a Table Generator workbook that allows researchers to build consistency distribution tables by selecting specific phonological or orthographic units; and a Master File workbook, from which all statistics were derived, and that allows researchers to compute other statistics. Silex is different from existing databases in the manner that silent-letter endings were coded and how consistency indices were computed. Importantly, Silex provides unconditional- and conditional-consistency indices for silent-letter endings. To demonstrate the utility of Silex, we first described the silent-letter phenomenon in French. We found that, at minimum, 28 {\%} of French words end with a silent letter. Moreover, silent-letter endings are usually t, e, s, x, or d, and the occurrence of these letters is conditioned by the phonological ending of words. Second, we showed how Silex could prove useful for the development of theoretical models and for empirical studies.

We present data that suggest that reporting normative data, based on methodological procedures that ask participants to consider multiple image constructs simultaneously, could potentially confounded norm data. We provide data for two new image constructs, beauty and the extent to which participants encountered the stimuli in their everyday lives. Analysis of this data suggests that familiarity and encounter are tapping different image constructs. The extent to which an observer encounters an object predicts human judgments of visual complexity. Encountering an image was also found to be an important predictor of beauty, but familiarity with that image was not. Taken together, these results suggest that continuing to collect complexity measures from human judgments is a pointless exercise. Automated measures are more reliable and valid measures, which are demonstrated here as predicting human preferences.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","revisit rossion pourtoi rate autom complex familiar beauti encount differ norm rate collect particip ask pictur characterist contrast tradit methodolog approach collect rate separ imag construct present data suggest report normat data base methodolog procedur particip multipl imag construct simultan potenti confound norm data provid data imag construct beauti extent particip encount stimuli everyday live analysi data suggest familiar encount tap imag construct extent observ encount object predict human judgment visual complex encount imag found import predictor beauti familiar imag result suggest continu collect complex measur human judgment pointless exercis autom measur reliabl valid measur demonstr predict human prefer",1

NA,"a film set for the elicitation of emotion in research a comprehensive catalog derived from four decades of investigation","Emotions are highly influential to many psychological processes. Indeed, research employing emotional stimuli is rapidly escalating across the field of psychology. However, challenges remain regarding discrete evocation of frequently co-elicited emotions such as amusement and happiness, or anger and disgust. Further, as much contemporary work in emotion employs college students, we sought to additionally evaluate the efficacy of film clips to discretely elicit these more challenging emotions in a young adult population using an online medium. The internet is an important tool for investigating responses to emotional stimuli, but validations of emotionally evocative film clips across laboratory and web-based settings are limited in the literature. An additional obstacle is identifying stimuli amidst the numerous film clip validation studies. During our investigation, we recognized the lack of a categorical database to facilitate rapid identification of useful film clips for individual researchers' unique investigations. Consequently, here we also sought to produce the first compilation of such stimuli into an accessible and comprehensive catalog. We based our catalog upon prior work as well as our own, and identified 24 articles and 295 film clips from four decades of research. We present information on the validation of these clips in addition to our own research validating six clips using online administration settings. The results of our search in the literature and our own study are presented in tables designed to facilitate and improve a selection of highly valid film stimuli for future research.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","film set elicit emot research comprehens catalog deriv decad investig emot high influenti psycholog process research employ emot stimuli rapid escal field psycholog challeng remain discret evoc frequent elicit emot amus happi anger disgust contemporari work emot employ colleg student sought addit evalu efficaci film clip discret elicit challeng emot young adult popul onlin medium internet import tool investig respons emot stimuli valid emot evoc film clip laboratori web base set limit literatur addit obstacl identifi stimuli amidst numer film clip valid studi investig recogn lack categor databas facilit rapid identif film clip individu research uniqu investig sought produc compil stimuli access comprehens catalog base catalog prior work identifi articl film clip decad research present inform valid clip addit research valid clip onlin administr set result search literatur studi present tabl design facilit improv select high valid film stimuli futur research",1
NA,"the many faces of a face comparing stills and videos of facial expressions in eight dimensions save database","This article presents subjective rating norms for a new set of Stills And Videos of facial Expressions-the SAVE database. Twenty nonprofessional models were filmed while posing in three different facial expressions (smile, neutral, and frown). After each pose, the models completed the PANAS questionnaire, and reported more positive affect after smiling and more negative affect after frowning. From the shooting material, stills and 5 s and 10 s videos were edited (total stimulus set = 180). A different sample of 120 participants evaluated the stimuli for attractiveness, arousal, clarity, genuineness, familiarity, intensity, valence, and similarity. Overall, facial expression had a main effect in all of the evaluated dimensions, with smiling models obtaining the highest ratings. Frowning expressions were perceived as being more arousing, clearer, and more intense, but also as more negative than neutral expressions. Stimulus presentation format only influenced the ratings of attractiveness, familiarity, genuineness, and intensity. The attractiveness and familiarity ratings increased with longer exposure times, whereas genuineness decreased. The ratings in the several dimensions were correlated. The subjective norms of facial stimuli presented in this article have potential applications to the work of researchers in several research domains. From our database, researchers may choose the most adequate stimulus presentation format for a particular experiment, select and manipulate the dimensions of interest, and control for the remaining dimensions.

NA,"moved by words affective ratings for a set of 2266 spanish words in five discrete emotion categories","The two main theoretical accounts of the human affective space are the dimensional perspective and the discrete-emotion approach. In recent years, several affective norms have been developed from a dimensional perspective, including ratings for valence and arousal. In contrast, the number of published datasets relying on the discrete-emotion approach is much lower. There is a need to fill this gap, considering that discrete emotions have an effect on word processing above and beyond those of valence and arousal. In the present study, we present ratings from 1,380 participants for a set of 2,266 Spanish words in five discrete emotion categories: happiness, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness. This will be the largest dataset published to date containing ratings for discrete emotions. We also present, for the first time, a fine-grained analysis of the distribution of words into the five emotion categories. This analysis reveals that happiness words are the most consistently related to a single, discrete emotion category. In contrast, there is a tendency for many negative words to belong to more than one discrete emotion. The only exception is disgust words, which overlap least with the other negative emotions. Normative valence and arousal data already exist for all of the words included in this corpus. Thus, the present database will allow researchers to design studies to contrast the predictions of the two most influential theoretical perspectives in this field. These studies will undoubtedly contribute to a deeper understanding of the effects of emotion on word processing.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","move word affect rate set spanish word discret emot categori main theoret account human affect space dimension perspect discret emot approach recent year affect norm develop dimension perspect includ rate valenc arous contrast number publish dataset reli discret emot approach lower fill gap discret emot effect word process valenc arous present studi present rate particip set spanish word discret emot categori happi anger fear disgust sad largest dataset publish date rate discret emot present time fine grain analysi distribut word emot categori analysi reveal happi word consist relat singl discret emot categori contrast tendenc negat word belong discret emot except disgust word overlap negat emot normat valenc arous data exist word includ corpus present databas research design studi contrast predict influenti theoret perspect field studi undoubt contribut deeper understand effect emot word process",1
NA,"the dalhouses 100 new photographs of houses with ratings of typicality familiarity and degree of similarity to faces","Houses have often been used as comparison stimuli in face-processing studies because of the many attributes they share with faces (e.g., distinct members of a basic category, consistent internal features, mono-orientation, and relative familiarity). Despite this, no large, well-controlled databases of photographs of houses that have been developed for research use currently exist. To address this gap, we photographed 100 houses and carefully edited these images. We then asked 41 undergraduate students (18 to 31 years of age) to rate each house on three dimensions: typicality, likeability, and face-likeness. The ratings had a high degree of face validity, and analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between typicality and likeability. We anticipate that this stimulus set (i.e., the DalHouses) and the associated ratings will prove useful to face-processing researchers by minimizing the effort required to acquire stimuli and allowing for easier replication and extension of studies.

Currently publicly available Korean corpora are limited by the fact that they only provide orthographic representations in Hangeul, which is problematic since phonetic forms in Korean cannot be reliably predicted from orthographic forms. We describe the method used to derive the surface phonetic forms from a publicly available orthographic corpus of Korean, and report on several statistics calculated using this database; namely, segment unigram frequencies, which are compared to previously reported results, along with segment-based and syllable-based neighborhood density statistics for three types of representation: an ""orthographic"" form, which is a quasi-phonological representation, a ""conservative"" form, which maintains all known contrasts, and a ""modern"" form, which represents the pronunciation of contemporary Seoul Korean.

Measures of several objective psycholinguistic variables—grammatical class, word frequency, number of letters, and number of syllables—for the words are also included. We observed high split-half reliabilities for every emotional variable and a strong quadratic relationship between valence and arousal. Additional analyses revealed several associations between the affective dimensions and discrete emotions, as well as with some psycholinguistic variables.

In addition, it has several advantages over the widely used lexical decision task. That is, the speeded word fragment completion task is more efficient, more engaging, and easier. Given its potential, we conducted a study to gather speeded word fragment completion norms. The goal of this megastudy was twofold. On the one hand, it provides a rich database of over 8,000 stimuli, which can, for instance, be used in future research to equate stimuli on baseline response times. On the other hand, the aim was to gain insight into the underlying processes of the speeded word fragment completion task. To this end, item-level regression and mixed-effects analyses were performed on the response latencies using 23 predictor variables. Since all items were selected from the Dutch Lexicon Project (Keuleers, Diependaele, {\&} Brysbaert Frontiers in Psychology, 1, 174, 2010), we ran the same analyses on lexical decision latencies to compare the two tasks. Overall, the results revealed many similarities, but also some remarkable differences, which are discussed. We propose that both tasks are complementary when examining visual word recognition.

NA,"database of synesthetic color associations for japanese kanji","Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which certain types of stimuli elicit involuntary perceptions in an unrelated pathway. A common type of synesthesia is grapheme–color synesthesia, in which the visual perception of letters and numbers stimulates the perception of a specific color. Previous studies have often collected relatively small numbers of grapheme–color associations per synesthete, but the accumulation of a large quantity of data has greater promise for uncovering the mechanisms underlying synesthetic association. In this study, we therefore collected large samples of data from a total of eight synesthetes. All told, we obtained over 1000 synesthetic colors associated with Japanese kanji characters from each of two synesthetes, over 100 synesthetic colors form each of three synesthetes, and about 80 synesthetic colors associated with Japanese hiragana, Latin letters, and Arabic numerals from each of three synesthetes. We then compiled the data into a database, called the KANJI-Synesthetic Colors Database (K-SCD), which has a total of 5122 colors for 483, 46, and 46 Japanese kanji, hiragana, and katakana characters, respectively, as well as for 26 Latin letters and ten Arabic numerals. In addition to introducing the K-SCD, this article demonstrates the database's merits by using two examples, in which two new rules for synesthetic association, “shape similarity” and “synesthetic color clustering,” were found. The K-SCD is publicly accessible (www.cv.jinkan.kyoto-u.ac.jp/site/uploads/K-SCD.xlsm) and will be a valuable resource for those who wish to conduct statistical analyses using a rich dataset in order to uncover the rules governing synesthetic association and to understand its mechanisms.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","databas synesthet color associ japanes kanji synesthesia neurolog phenomenon type stimuli elicit involuntari percept unrel pathway common type synesthesia graphem color synesthesia visual percept letter number stimul percept specif color previous studi collect small number graphem color associ synesthet accumul larg quantiti data greater promis uncov mechan under synesthet associ studi collect larg sampl data total synesthet told obtain synesthet color japanes kanji charact synesthet synesthet color form synesthet synesthet color japanes hiragana latin letter arab numer synesthet compil data databas call kanji synesthet color databas scd total color japanes kanji hiragana katakana charact latin letter ten arab numer addit introduc scd articl demonstr databas merit exampl rule synesthet associ shape similar synesthet color cluster found scd public access wwwcvjinkankyoto acjpsiteupload scdxlsm valuabl resourc conduct statist analys rich dataset order uncov rule govern synesthet associ understand mechan",1

However, in recent years there has been growing interest in studying the relationship, as well as the potential overlaps, between the two. This article describes a database that provides subjective ratings for 1,400 Spanish words for valence, arousal, concreteness, imageability, context availability, and familiarity. Data were collected online through a process involving 826 university students. The results showed a high interrater reliability for all of the variables examined, as well as high correlations between our affective and semantic values and norms currently available in other Spanish databases. Regarding the affective variables, the typical quadratic correlation between valence and arousal ratings was obtained. Likewise, significant correlations were found between the lexico-semantic variables. Importantly, we obtained moderate negative correlations between emotionality and both concreteness and imageability. This is in line with the claim that abstract words have more affective associations than concrete ones (Kousta, Vigliocco, Vinson, Andrews, {\&} Del Campo, 2011).

NA,"the conceptual cueing database rated items for the study of the interaction between language and attention","Humans appear to rely on spatial mappings to describe and represent concepts. In particular, conceptual cueing refers to the effect whereby after reading or hearing a particular word, the location of observers' visual attention in space can be systematically shifted in a particular direction. For example, words such as ""sun"" and ""happy"" orient attention upwards, whereas words such as ""basement"" and ""bitter"" orient attention downwards. This area of research has garnered much interest, particularly within the embodied cognition framework, for its potential to enhance our understanding of the interaction between abstract cognitive processes such as language and basic visual processes such as attention and stimulus processing. To date, however, this area has relied on subjective classification criteria to determine whether words ought to be classified as having a meaning that implies ""up"" or ""down."" The present study, therefore, provides a set of 498 items that have each been systematically rated by over 90 participants, providing refined, continuous measures of the extent to which people associate given words with particular spatial dimensions.

NA,"moral foundations vignettes a standardized stimulus database of scenarios based on moral foundations theory","Research on the emotional, cognitive, and social determinants of moral judgment has surged in recent years. The development of moral foundations theory (MFT) has played an important role, demonstrating the breadth of morality. Moral psychology has responded by investigating how different domains of moral judgment are shaped by a variety of psychological factors. Yet, the discipline lacks a validated set of moral violations that span the moral domain, creating a barrier to investigating influences on judgment and how their neural bases might vary across the moral domain. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by developing and validating a large set of moral foundations vignettes (MFVs). Each vignette depicts a behavior violating a particular moral foundation and not others. The vignettes are controlled on many dimensions including syntactic structure and complexity making them suitable for neuroimaging research. We demonstrate the validity of our vignettes by examining respondents' classifications of moral violations, conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and demonstrating the correspondence between the extracted factors and existing measures of the moral foundations. We expect that the MFVs will be beneficial for a wide variety of behavioral and neuroimaging investigations of moral cognition.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"Yes","moral foundat vignett standard stimulus databas scenario base moral foundat theori research emot cognit social determin moral judgment surg recent year develop moral foundat theori mft play import role demonstr breadth moral moral psycholog respond investig domain moral judgment shape varieti psycholog factor disciplin lack valid set moral violat span moral domain creat barrier investig influenc judgment neural base vari moral domain paper aim fill gap develop valid larg set moral foundat vignett mfvs vignett depict behavior violat moral foundat vignett control dimens includ syntact structur complex make suitabl neuroimag research demonstr valid vignett examin respond classif moral violat conduct exploratori confirmatori factor analysi demonstr correspond extract factor exist measur moral foundat expect mfvs benefici wide varieti behavior neuroimag investig moral cognit",1

NA,"when emotions are expressed figuratively psycholinguistic and affective norms of 619 idioms for german panig","Despite flourishing research on the relationship between emotion and literal language, and despite the pervasiveness of figurative expressions in communication, the role of figurative language in conveying affect has been underinvestigated. This study provides affective and psycholinguistic norms for 619 German idiomatic expressions and explores the relationships between affective and psycholinguistic idiom properties. German native speakers rated each idiom for emotional valence, arousal, familiarity, semantic transparency, figurativeness, and concreteness. They also described the figurative meaning of each idiom and rated how confident they were about the attributed meaning. The results showed that idioms rated high in valence were also rated high in arousal. Negative idioms were rated as more arousing than positive ones, in line with results from single words. Furthermore, arousal correlated positively with figurativeness (supporting the idea that figurative expressions are more emotionally engaging than literal expressions) and with concreteness and semantic transparency. This suggests that idioms may convey a more direct reference to sensory representations, mediated by the meanings of their constituting words. Arousal correlated positively with familiarity. In addition, positive idioms were rated as more familiar than negative idioms. Finally, idioms without a literal counterpart were rated as more emotionally valenced and arousing than idioms with a literal counterpart. Although the meanings of ambiguous idioms were less correctly defined than those of unambiguous idioms, ambiguous idioms were rated as more concrete than unambiguous ones.

NA,"a psycholinguistic database for traditional chinese character naming","In this study, we aimed to provide a large-scale set of psycholinguistic norms for 3,314 traditional Chinese characters, along with their naming reaction times (RTs), collected from 140 Chinese speakers. The lexical and semantic variables in the database include frequency, regularity, familiarity, consistency, number of strokes, homophone density, semantic ambiguity rating, phonetic combinability, semantic combinability, and the number of disyllabic compound words formed by a character. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the predictive powers of these variables for the naming RTs. The results demonstrated that these variables could account for a significant portion of variance (55.8{\%}) in the naming RTs. An additional multiple regression analysis was conducted to demonstrate the effects of consistency and character frequency. Overall, the regression results were consistent with the findings of previous studies on Chinese character naming. This database should be useful for research into Chinese language processing, Chinese education, or cross-linguistic comparisons.

The words were selected on the basis of co-occurrence profiles of representative keywords for these semantic fields. All words were rated along five dimensions, each measured by a bipolar semantic-differential scale: Besides the classic dimensions of affective meaning (valence, arousal, and potency), we collected ratings of authority and community with newly developed scales. The results from cluster, correlational, and multiple regression analyses on the rating data suggest a robust negativity bias for authority valuation among German raters recruited via university mailing lists, whereas community ratings appear to be rather unrelated to the well-established affective dimensions. Furthermore, our data involve a strong overall negative correlation-rather than the classical U-shaped distribution-between valence and arousal for socially relevant concepts.

To fill this gap, we created the GEneva Faces and Voices (GEFAV) database, providing standardized faces (static and dynamic neutral, smiling) and voices (speaking sentences, vowels) of young European adults. A total of 61 women and 50 men 18-35 years old agreed to be part of the GEFAV stimuli, and two rating studies involving 285 participants provided evaluations of the facial and vocal samples. The final set of stimuli was satisfactory in terms of attractiveness range (wide and rather symmetrical distribution over the attractiveness continuum) and the reliability of the ratings (high consistency between the two rating studies, high interrater agreement in the final rating study). Moreover, the database showed an adequate validity, since a series of findings described by earlier research on human attractiveness were confirmed-namely, that facial and vocal attractiveness are predicted by femininity and health in women, and by masculinity, dominance, and trustworthiness in men. In future studies, the GEFAV stimuli may be used intact or transformed, individually or in multimodal combinations, to investigate a wide range of mechanisms, such as the behavioral, neuropsychological, and neurophysiological processes involved in social cognition.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"Yes","geneva face voic gefav databas facial vocal databas research control rang attract stimuli offer fill gap creat geneva face voic gefav databas provid standard face static dynam neutral smile voic speak sentenc vowel young european adult total women men year agre part gefav stimuli rate studi involv particip provid evalu facial vocal sampl final set stimuli satisfactori term attract rang wide symmetr distribut attract continuum reliabl rate high consist rate studi high interrat agreement final rate studi databas show adequ valid seri find earlier research human attract confirm facial vocal attract predict feminin health women masculin domin trustworthi men futur studi gefav stimuli intact transform individu multimod combin investig wide rang mechan behavior neuropsycholog neurophysiolog process involv social cognit",1

NA,"equiword a software application for the automatic creation of truly equivalent word lists","Word lists are most commonly used in the investigation of human memory. To prevent transfer effects, repeated measures of memory for words require multiple lists of different words. Yet, the psycholinguistic properties of all word lists employed should match as closely as possible to avoid confounding with the independent variable(s) in question. Although comprehensive databases for word norms exist, to our knowledge no tool is available that automates the creation of such equivalent word lists. Instead, matching different lists is often accomplished prima facie. We have therefore developed a Windows program called EQUIWORD that completely automates the creation of word lists that are truly parallel with respect to a wide range of attributes. EQUIWORD takes psycholinguistic databases of different formats as input and computes several coefficients of distance for every possible word pairing. Program output consists of a list of all word pairs sorted according to their distance. On that basis, creating equivalent word lists is simply done by selecting the pairs with the lowest distance coefficients.","Behavior Research Methods",2006,"Yes","equiword softwar applic automat creation equival word list word list common investig human memori prevent transfer effect repeat measur memori word requir multipl list word psycholinguist properti word list employ match close avoid confound independ variabl question comprehens databas word norm exist knowledg tool autom creation equival word list match list accomplish prima faci develop window program call equiword complet autom creation word list parallel respect wide rang attribut equiword take psycholinguist databas format input comput coeffici distanc word pair program output consist list word pair sort distanc basi creat equival word list simpli select pair lowest distanc coeffici",1

The study validates TAACO by investigating how its indices related to local, global, and overall text cohesion can predict expert judgments of text coherence and essay quality. The findings of this study provide predictive validation of TAACO and support the notion that expert judgments of text coherence and quality are either negatively correlated or not predicted by local and overall text cohesion indices, but are positively predicted by global indices of cohesion. Combined, these findings provide supporting evidence that coherence for expert raters is a property of global cohesion and not of local cohesion, and that expert ratings of text quality are positively related to global cohesion.","Behavior Research Methods",2016,"Yes","tool automat analysi text cohes taaco automat assess local global text cohes studi introduc tool automat analysi cohes taaco freeli text analysi tool easi work oper system window mac linux hous user hard drive internet interfac batch process text file incorpor classic recent develop indic relat text cohes studi valid taaco investig indic relat local global text cohes predict expert judgment text coher essay qualiti find studi provid predict valid taaco support notion expert judgment text coher qualiti negat correl predict local text cohes indic posit predict global indic cohes combin find provid support evid coher expert rater properti global cohes local cohes expert rate text qualiti posit relat global cohes",1

For visual stimulation, the only reliable database available so far is the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). However, extensive use of these stimuli lowers the impact of the images by increasing the knowledge that participants have of them. Moreover, the limited number of pictures for specific themes in the IAPS database is a concern for studies centered on a specific emotion thematic and for designs requiring a lot of trials from the same kind (e.g., EEG recordings). Thus, in the present article, we present a new database of 730 pictures, the Geneva Affective PicturE Database, which was created to increase the availability of visual emotion stimuli. Four specific negative contents were chosen: spiders, snakes, and scenes that induce emotions related to the violation of moral and legal norms (human rights violation or animal mistreatment). Positive and neutral pictures were also included: Positive pictures represent mainly human and animal babies as well as nature sceneries, whereas neutral pictures mainly depict inanimate objects. The pictures were rated according to valence, arousal, and the congruence of the represented scene with internal (moral) and external (legal) norms.

The AV level was varied between pairs. The proportion of Ss able to generate an NLM is the associability value (AS). As expected, AS and AV are correlated although AS varies considerably among pairs composed of items about equal in AV. Experiments run after the AS scale was obtained demonstrated that AS is valuable as a predictor of learning rate.

Semantic distance was found to correlate weakly with these other measures but to correlate more strongly with another measure of semantic relatedness, featural similarity. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the knowledge structure underlying semantic distance is similar in gross form to that underlying featural similarity. In experiments in which semantic similarity ratings were used, human participants were able to discriminate semantic distance.

Then we compare ACOM's responses with Hirsh and Tree's (2001) word association norms based on the responses of two groups of subjects. The results showed that words associated by 50{\%} or more of the Hirsh and Tree subjects were also proposed by ACOM (e.g., 71{\%} of the words in the norms were also given by ACOM).

NA,"the bank of standardized stimuli boss comparison between french and english norms","Throughout the last decades, numerous picture data sets have been developed, such as the Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) set, and have been normalized for variables such as name and familiarity; however, due to cultural and linguistic differences, norms can vary from one country to another. The effect due specifically to culture has already been demonstrated by comparing samples from different countries where the same language is spoken. On the other hand, it is still not clear how differences between languages may affect norms. The present study explores this issue by collecting and comparing norms on names and many other features from French Canadian speakers and English Canadian speakers living in Montreal, who thus live in similar cultural environments. Norms were collected for the photos of objects from the Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS) by asking participants to name the objects, to categorize them, and to rate their familiarity, visual complexity, object agreement, viewpoint agreement, and manipulability. Names and ratings from the French speakers are available in Appendix A, available in the supplemental materials. The results show that most of the norms are comparable across linguistic groups and also that the ratings given are correlated across linguistic groups. The only significant group differences were found in viewpoint agreement and visual complexity. Overall, there was good concordance between the norms collected from French and English native speakers living in the same cultural setting.","Behavior Research Methods",2012,"Yes","bank standard stimuli boss comparison french english norm decad numer pictur data set develop snodgrass vanderwart set normal variabl familiar due cultur linguist differ norm vari countri effect due specif cultur demonstr compar sampl countri languag spoken hand clear differ languag affect norm present studi explor issu collect compar norm name featur french canadian speaker english canadian speaker live montreal live similar cultur environ norm collect photo object bank standard stimuli boss particip object categor rate familiar visual complex object agreement viewpoint agreement manipul name rate french speaker appendix supplement materi result show norm compar linguist group rate correl linguist group signific group differ found viewpoint agreement visual complex good concord norm collect french english nativ speaker live cultur set",1

A high incidence of confusions indicates that observers readily use available cues for arriving at letter responses. Analysis of the confusions leads to perceptual similarities and to common properties that have possibly served as perceptual cues. Dominating similarities are /h k b/, /tilfr/,/eoc/,/aszxe/,/vw/and/gq/. Properties with high cue values are: 1. (1) vertically ascending and descending parts, 2. (2) slenderness, 3. (3) outer vertical and outer oblique parts, and also outer gaps. Inner parts are weak cues at best. Bias effects occur towards letters that occur frequently in the printed language, but they are restricted to confusions. Perceptual cues prevail over bias effects.

The pictures are black-and-white line drawings executed according to a set of rules that provide consistency of pictorial representation. The pictures have been standardized on four variables of central relevance to memory and cognitive processing: name agreement, image agreement, familiarity, and visual complexity. The intercorrelations among the four measures were low, suggesting that they are indices of different attributes of the pictures. The concepts were selected to provide exemplars from several widely studied semantic categories. Sources of naming variance, and mean familiarity and complexity of the exemplars, differed significantly across the set of categories investigated.

Computed from a 3.2-million-word corpus, ESCOLEX provides 48,381 word forms extracted from 171 elementary and middle school textbooks for 6- to 11-year-old children attending the first six grades in the Portuguese educational system. Like other children's grade-level databases (e.g., Carroll, Davies, {\&} Richman, 1971; Corral, Ferrero, {\&} Goikoetxea, Behavior Research Methods, 41, 1009–1017, 2009; L{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}, Sprenger-Charolles, {\&} Col{\'{e}}, Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, {\&} Computers, 36, 156–166, 2004; Zeno, Ivens, Millard, Duvvuri, 1995), ESCOLEX provides four frequency indices for each grade: overall word frequency (F), index of dispersion across the selected textbooks (D), estimated frequency per million words (U), and standard frequency index (SFI). It also provides a new measure, contextual diversity (CD). In addition, the number of letters in the word and its part(s) of speech, number of syllables, syllable structure, and adult frequencies taken from P-PAL (a European Portuguese corpus-based lexical database; Soares, Comesa{\~{n}}a, Iriarte, Almeida, Sim{\~{o}}es, Costa, {\ldots}, Machado, 2010; Soares, Iriarte, Almeida, Sim{\~{o}}es, Costa, Fran{\c{c}}a, {\ldots}, Comesa{\~{n}}a, in press) are provided.

The IADS-2 is a standardized database of 167 naturally occurring sounds that is widely used in the study of emotions. The sounds were rated by 300 college students who were native speakers of EP, in the three affective dimensions of valence, arousal, and dominance, by using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM). The aims of this adaptation were threefold: (1) to provide researchers with standardized and normatively rated affective sounds to be used with an EP population; (2) to investigate sex and cultural differences in the ratings of affective dimensions of auditory stimuli between EP and the American (Bradley {\&} Lang, 2007a) and Spanish (Fern{\'{a}}ndez-Abascal et al., Psicothema 20:104-113 2008; Redondo, Fraga, Padr{\'{o}}n, {\&} Pi{\~{n}}eiro, Behavior Research Methods 40:784-790 2008) standardizations; and (3) to promote research on auditory affective processing in Portugal. Our results indicated that the IADS-2 is a valid and useful database of digitized sounds for the study of emotions in a Portuguese context, allowing for comparisons of its results with those of other international studies that have used the same database for stimulus selection.

However, much has changed over the 32 years since the 1980 norms. For example, in 1980, most people knew the answer to the question ""What is the name of the Lone Ranger's Indian sidekick?"" (answer: Tonto), whereas in 2012, few people know this answer. Thus, we updated the 1980 norms and expanded them by providing new measures. In particular, we report two new metacognitive measures (confidence judgments and peer judgments) and provide a detailed report of commission errors. Each of these measures will be valuable to researchers, and together they are likely to facilitate future research in a number of fields, such as research investigating memory illusions, metamemory processes, and error correction. The presence of substantial generational shifts from 1980 to 2012 necessitates the use of updated norms.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"Yes","commiss errorsgener knowledg questionsmetacognit general knowledg norm updat expand nelson naren norm nelson naren journal verbal learn verbal behavior general knowledg norm valuabl research field chang year norm peopl knew answer question lone ranger indian sidekick answer tonto peopl answer updat norm expand provid measur report metacognit measur confid judgment peer judgment provid detail report commiss error measur valuabl research facilit futur research number field research investig memori illus metamemori process error correct presenc substanti generat shift necessit updat norm",1

"Humans,Language,Phonetics,Speech,Verbal Behavior,Vocabulary","similarity relations among spoken words the special status of rimes in english","This paper presents an analysis of the distribution of phonological similarity relations among monosyllabic spoken words in English. It differs from classical analyses of phonological neighborhood density (e.g., Luce {\&} Pisoni, 1998) by assuming that not all phonological neighbors are equal. Rather, it is assumed that the phonological lexicon has psycholinguistic structure. Accordingly, in addition to considering the number of phonological neighbors for any given word, it becomes important to consider the nature of these neighbors. If one type of neighbor is more dominant, neighborhood density effects may reflect levels of segmental representation other than the phoneme, particularly prior to literacy. Statistical analyses of the nature of phonological neighborhoods in terms of rime neighbors (e.g., hat/cat), consonant neighbors (e.g., hat/hit), and lead neighbors (e.g., hat/ham) were thus performed for all monosyllabic words in the Celex corpus (4,086 words). Our results show that most phonological neighbors are rime neighbors (e.g., hat/cat) in English. Similar patterns were found when a corpus of words for which age-of-acquisition ratings were available was analyzed. The resultant database can be used as a tool for controlling and selecting stimuli when the role of lexical neighborhoods in phonological development and speech processing is examined.","Behavior research methods, instruments, {\&} computers : a journal of the Psychonomic Society, Inc",2002,"Yes","humanslanguagephoneticsspeechverb behaviorvocabulari similar relat spoken word special status rime english paper present analysi distribut phonolog similar relat monosyllab spoken word english differ classic analys phonolog neighborhood densiti luce pisoni assum phonolog neighbor equal assum phonolog lexicon psycholinguist structur addit number phonolog neighbor word import natur neighbor type neighbor domin neighborhood densiti effect reflect level segment represent phonem prior literaci statist analys natur phonolog neighborhood term rime neighbor hatcat conson neighbor hathit lead neighbor hatham perform monosyllab word celex corpus word result show phonolog neighbor rime neighbor hatcat english similar pattern found corpus word age acquisit rate analyz result databas tool control select stimuli role lexic neighborhood phonolog develop speech process examin",1

Methods typically employed in such studies are based on the general linear model (e.g., ANOVA or multiple regression).

This failure to truly manipulate variables violate the assumptions of the analyses. A simulation is provided that demonstrates how this violation can lead to erroneous conclusions of effects when none are present.

NA,"subjective frequency estimates for 2938 monosyllabic words","Subjective frequency estimates for large sample of monosyllabic English words were collected from 574 young adults (undergraduate students) and from a separate group of 1,590 adults of varying ages and educational backgrounds. Estimates from the latter group were collected via the internet. In addition, 90 healthy older adults provided estimates for a random sample of 480 of these words. All groups rated words with respect to the estimated frequency of encounters of each word on a 7-point scale, ranging from never encountered to encountered several times a day. The young and older groups also rated each word with respect to the frequency of encounters in different perceptual domains (e.g., reading, hearing, writing, or speaking). The results of regression analyses indicated that objective log frequency and meaningfulness accounted for most of the variance in subjective frequency estimates, whereas neighborhood size accounted for the least amount of variance in the ratings. The predictive power of log frequency and meaningfulness were dependent on the level of subjective frequency estimates.

We present such data for 50 sets of grayscale object photographs. Similarity measures between pictures in each set (e.g., 25 different buttons) were collected using a similarity-sorting method (Goldstone, Behavior Research Methods Instruments {\&} Computers, 26(4):381-386, 1994). A validation experiment used data from 1 picture set and compared responses from standard pairwise measures. This showed close agreement. The similarity-sorting measures were then standardized across picture sets, using pairwise ratings. Finally, the standardized similarity distances were validated in a recognition memory experiment; false alarms increased when targets and foils were more similar.

"Acoustic cues,Auditory processing,Emotion recognition,Expression corpus,Nonverbal vocalizations","when voices get emotional a corpus of nonverbal vocalizations for research on emotion processing","Nonverbal vocal expressions, such as laughter, sobbing, and screams, are an important source of emotional information in social interactions. However, the investigation of how we process these vocal cues entered the research agenda only recently. Here, we introduce a new corpus of nonverbal vocalizations, which we recorded and submitted to perceptual and acoustic validation. It consists of 121 sounds expressing four positive emotions (achievement/triumph, amusement, sensual pleasure, and relief) and four negative ones (anger, disgust, fear, and sadness), produced by two female and two male speakers. For perceptual validation, a forced choice task was used (n = 20), and ratings were collected for the eight emotions, valence, arousal, and authenticity (n = 20). We provide these data, detailed for each vocalization, for use by the research community. High recognition accuracy was found for all emotions (86 {\%}, on average), and the sounds were reliably rated as communicating the intended expressions. The vocalizations were measured for acoustic cues related to temporal aspects, intensity, fundamental frequency (f0), and voice quality. These cues alone provide sufficient information to discriminate between emotion categories, as indicated by statistical classification procedures; they are also predictors of listeners' emotion ratings, as indicated by multiple regression analyses. This set of stimuli seems a valuable addition to currently available expression corpora for research on emotion processing. It is suitable for behavioral and neuroscience research and might as well be used in clinical settings for the assessment of neurological and psychiatric patients.

"Natural speech,Pause durations","fluency profiling system an automated system for analyzing the temporal properties of speech","The temporal characteristics of speech can be captured by examining the distributions of the durations of measurable speech components, namely speech segment durations and pause durations. However, several barriers prevent the easy analysis of pause durations: The first problem is that natural speech is noisy, and although recording contrived speech minimizes this problem, it also discards diagnostic information about cognitive processes inherent in the longer pauses associated with natural speech. The second issue concerns setting the distribution threshold, and consists of the problem of appropriately classifying pause segments as either short pauses reflecting articulation or long pauses reflecting cognitive processing, while minimizing the overall classification error rate. This article describes a fully automated system for determining the locations of speech-pause transitions and estimating the temporal parameters of both speech and pause distributions in natural speech. We use the properties of Gaussian mixture models at several stages of the analysis, in order to identify theoretical components of the data distributions, to classify speech components, to compute durations, and to calculate the relevant statistics.;","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"Yes","natur speechpaus durat fluenci profil system autom system analyz tempor properti speech tempor characterist speech captur examin distribut durat measur speech compon speech segment durat paus durat barrier prevent easi analysi paus durat problem natur speech noisi record contriv speech minim problem discard diagnost inform cognit process inher longer paus natur speech issu concern set distribut threshold consist problem appropri classifi paus segment short paus reflect articul long paus reflect cognit process minim classif error rate articl describ fulli autom system determin locat speech paus transit estim tempor paramet speech paus distribut natur speech properti gaussian mixtur model stage analysi order identifi theoret compon data distribut classifi speech compon comput durat calcul relev statist",1

"Automated essay scoring,Computational linguistics,Corpus linguistics,Intelligent tutoring systems,Natural language processing,Writing pedagogy","natural language processing in an intelligent writing strategy tutoring system","The Writing Pal is an intelligent tutoring system that provides writing strategy training. A large part of its artificial intelligence resides in the natural language processing algorithms to assess essay quality and guide feedback to students. Because writing is often highly nuanced and subjective, the development of these algorithms must consider a broad array of linguistic, rhetorical, and contextual features. This study assesses the potential for computational indices to predict human ratings of essay quality. Past studies have demonstrated that linguistic indices related to lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity are significant predictors of human judgments of essay quality but that indices of cohesion are not. The present study extends prior work by including a larger data sample and an expanded set of indices to assess new lexical, syntactic, cohesion, rhetorical, and reading ease indices. Three models were assessed. The model reported by McNamara, Crossley, and McCarthy (Written Communication 27:57-86, 2010) including three indices of lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity accounted for only 6{\%} of the variance in the larger data set. A regression model including the full set of indices examined in prior studies of writing predicted 38{\%} of the variance in human scores of essay quality with 91{\%} adjacent accuracy (i.e., within 1 point). A regression model that also included new indices related to rhetoric and cohesion predicted 44{\%} of the variance with 94{\%} adjacent accuracy. The new indices increased accuracy but, more importantly, afford the means to provide more meaningful feedback in the context of a writing tutoring system.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"Yes","autom essay scoringcomput linguisticscorpus linguisticsintellig tutor systemsnatur languag processingwrit pedagogi natur languag process intellig write strategi tutor system write pal intellig tutor system write strategi train larg part artifici intellig resid natur languag process algorithm assess essay qualiti guid feedback student write high nuanc subject develop algorithm broad array linguist rhetor contextu featur studi assess potenti comput indic predict human rate essay qualiti past studi demonstr linguist indic relat lexic divers word frequenc syntact complex signific predictor human judgment essay qualiti indic cohes present studi extend prior work includ larger data sampl expand set indic assess lexic syntact cohes rhetor read eas indic model assess model report mcnamara crossley mccarthi written communic includ indic lexic divers word frequenc syntact complex account varianc larger data set regress model includ full set indic examin prior studi write predict varianc human score essay qualiti adjac accuraci point regress model includ indic relat rhetor cohes predict varianc adjac accuraci indic increas accuraci import afford mean provid meaning feedback context write tutor system",1
"Grounded cognition,Lexical decision,Word recognition","tangible words are recognized faster the grounding of meaning in sensory and perceptual systems","Sensory experience rating (SER), a new variable motivated by the grounded cognition framework of conceptual processing (e.g., Barsalou, 2008 ), indexes the degree to which a word evokes sensory/perceptual experiences. In the present study, SERs were collected for over 2,850 words. While SER is correlated with imageability, age of acquisition, and word frequency, the latter variables (along with seven others) account for less than 30{\%} of the variance in SER. Reanalyses of two large-scale studies demonstrate that SER significantly predicts lexical decision times when other established predictor variables are statistically controlled. These results suggest that conceptual processing is grounded in sensory systems.

For instance, several researchers have manipulated the type of grip associated with objects in order to study the role of the objects' motor affordances in cognition. The objective of the present study was to develop norms for the types of grip employed when grasping and using objects, with a set of 296 photographs of objects. On the basis of these ratings, we computed measures of agreement to evaluate the extent to which participants agreed about the grip used to interact with these objects. We also collected ratings on the dissimilarity between the grips employed for grasping and for using objects, as well as the number of actions that can typically be performed with the objects. Our results showed grip agreements of 67 {\%} for grasping and of 65 {\%} for using objects. Moreover, our pattern of correlations is highly consistent with the idea that the grips for grasping and using objects represent two different motor dimensions of the objects.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"Yes","grip typenormsobject norm grip agreement photograph object increas number studi investig cognit process under human object interact instanc research manipul type grip object order studi role object motor afford cognit object present studi develop norm type grip employ grasp object set photograph object basi rate comput measur agreement evalu extent particip agre grip interact object collect rate dissimilar grip employ grasp object number action typic perform object result show grip agreement grasp object pattern correl high consist idea grip grasp object repres motor dimens object",1

Concrete and abstract words of negative, neutral or positive valence, as well as pseudowords were presented in a hemifield lexical decision task. Experiment 1 yielded early (P2) and late (N400, late positive component/LPC) emotional word effects. Concreteness affected the N400 and the LPC. In line with the extended dual coding model and with previous studies, the N400 effect represents greater semantic activation, whereas the LPC effect may result from mental imagery being activated by concrete words. Experiment 2 engaged participants in a go/no-go task pressing a button for pseudowords. Here, emotionality and concreteness modulated the N400 independently, but interacted in the LPC time window. Only concrete emotional words differed in the LPC response suggesting that concrete negative words such as ""wound"" or ""bomb"" differ from neutral and positive words as a function of mental imagery. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

NA,"coh metrix capturing linguistic features of cohesion","This study addresses the need in discourse psychology for computational techniques that analyze text on multiple levels of cohesion and text difficulty. Discourse psychologists often investigate phenomena related to discourse processing using lengthy texts containing multiple paragraphs, as opposed to single word and sentence stimuli. Characterizing such texts in terms of cohesion and coherence is challenging. Some computational tools are available, but they are either fragmented over different databases or they assess single, specific features of text. Coh-Metrix is a computational linguistic tool that measures text cohesion and text difficulty on a range of word, sentence, paragraph, and discourse dimensions. This study investigated the validity of Coh-Metrix as a measure of cohesion in text using stimuli from published discourse psychology studies as a benchmark. Results showed that Coh-Metrix indexes of cohesion (individually and combined) significantly distinguished the high- versus low-cohesion versions of these texts. The results also showed that commonly used readability indexes (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) inappropriately distinguished between low- and high-cohesion texts. These results provide a validation of Coh-Metrix, thereby paving the way for its use by researchers in cognitive science, discourse processes, and education, as well as for textbook writers, professionals in instructional design, and instructors. 2010 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Discourse Processes",2010,"Yes","coh metrix captur linguist featur cohes studi address discours psycholog comput techniqu analyz text multipl level cohes text difficulti discours psychologist investig phenomena relat discours process lengthi text multipl paragraph oppos singl word sentenc stimuli character text term cohes coher challeng comput tool fragment databas assess singl specif featur text coh metrix comput linguist tool measur text cohes text difficulti rang word sentenc paragraph discours dimens studi investig valid coh metrix measur cohes text stimuli publish discours psycholog studi benchmark result show coh metrix index cohes individu combin signific distinguish high versus low cohes version text result show common readabl index flesch kincaid inappropri distinguish low high cohes text result provid valid coh metrix pave research cognit scienc discours process educ textbook writer profession instruct design instructor copyright taylor franci group llc",1

Here, we investigated whether differences in the way words are typed correspond to differences in their meanings. Some words are spelled with more letters on the right side of the keyboard and others with more letters on the left. In three experiments, we tested whether asymmetries in the way people interact with keys on the right and left of the keyboard influence their evaluations of the emotional valence of the words. We found the predicted relationship between emotional valence and QWERTY key position across three languages (English, Spanish, and Dutch). Words with more right-side letters were rated as more positive in valence, on average, than words with more left-side letters: the QWERTY effect. This effect was strongest in new words coined after QWERTY was invented and was also found in pseudowords. Although these data are correlational, the discovery of a similar pattern across languages, which was strongest in neologisms, suggests that the QWERTY keyboard is shaping the meanings of words as people filter language through their fingers.

However, previous studies have not provided good empirical information on the iconicity of specific characters. To fill this gap, 40 U.S. adults with no knowledge of Chinese were given an English word or short phrase together with two Chinese characters and were asked which character matched the meaning of the English word. The right and wrong answers had the same number of strokes, and different wrong answers were used for different participants. We examined all 213 simple-structure Chinese characters that occur in textbooks for elementary school children. The overall percentage of correct responses was 53.6{\%}, slightly but significantly higher than would be expected by chance. Using a false discovery rate procedure, we found that 15 of the 213 characters were guessed at a level higher than chance.

NA,"configural and featural processing during face perception a new stimulus set","A new stimulus set of 60 male-face stimuli in seven in-depth orientations was developed. The set can be used in research on configural versus featural mechanisms of face processing. Configural, or holistic, changes are produced by changing the global form of the face, whereas featural, or part-based, changes are attained by altering the local form of internal facial features. For each face in the set, there is one other face that differs only by its global form and one other face that differs only by its internal features. In all faces, extrafacial cues have been eliminated or standardized. The stimulus set also contains a color-coded division of each face in areas of interest, which is useful for eye movement research on face scanning strategies. We report a matching experiment with upright and inverted face pairs that demonstrates that the face stimulus set is indeed useful for research on configural and featural face perception.

NA,"match a program to assist in matching the conditions of factorial experiments","In most experiments that involve between-subjects or between-items factorial designs, the items and/or the participants in the various experimental groups differ on one or more variables, but need to be matched on all other factors that can affect the outcome measure. Matching large groups of items or participants on multiple dimensions is a difficult and time-consuming task, yet failure to match conditions will lead to suboptimal experiments. We describe a computer program, ""Match"", that automates this process by selecting the best-matching items from larger sets of candidate items. In most cases, the program produces near-optimal solutions in amatter of minutes and selects matches that are typically superior to those obtained using hand matching or other semiautomated processes. We report the results of a case study in which Match was used to generate matched sets of experimental items (words varying in length and frequency) for a published study on language processing. The program was able to come up with better-matching item sets than those hand-selected by the authors of the original study, and in a fraction of the time originally taken up with stimulus matching.","Behavior Research Methods",2007,"Yes","match program assist match condit factori experi experi involv subject item factori design item particip experiment group differ variabl match factor affect outcom measur match larg group item particip multipl dimens difficult time consum task failur match condit lead suboptim experi describ comput program match autom process select match item larger set candid item case program produc optim solut amatt minut select match typic superior obtain hand match semiautom process report result case studi match generat match set experiment item word vari length frequenc publish studi languag process program match item set hand select author origin studi fraction time origin stimulus match",1

I wanted to examine how well ANEW and other word lists performs for the detection of sentiment strength in microblog posts in comparison with a new word list specifically constructed for microblogs.

NA,"priming dominant and unusual senses of ambiguous words","The priming technique was used to investigate the conditions under which a homograph's dominant and/or nondominant semantic sense will be retrieved. Subjects verified whether “A(n) A is a(n) B” when A was an ambiguous word and B was a word corresponding to either a dominant or an unusual semantic sense of word A. When word B most often corresponded to the dominant sense of word A (Experiment I), a Priming by Dominance interaction was obtained in the reaction time (RT) data; viz, the facilitatory effect of priming was greater for the dominant-sense sentences than for the unusual-sense sentences. When the word B equally often corresponded to the dominant and unusual senses of A (Experiment 2), the facilitatory effect of priming was equal for the dominant-sense and unusual-sense sentences. These results were interpreted within the framework of a two-stage model of lexical access (d. Posner {\&} Snyder, 1975; Neely, 1977). An application of this two-stage model to the now rather extensive literature on homographic processing helps clear up the apparent contradictions that have been prevalent in this literature.","Memory {\&} Cognition",1978,"Yes","prime domin unusu sens ambigu word prime techniqu investig condit homograph domin nondomin semant sens retriev subject verifi ambigu word word domin unusu semant sens word word correspond domin sens word experi prime domin interact obtain reaction time rt data facilitatori effect prime greater domin sens sentenc unusu sens sentenc word equal correspond domin unusu sens experi facilitatori effect prime equal domin sens unusu sens sentenc result interpret framework stage model lexic access posner snyder neeli applic stage model extens literatur homograph process help clear appar contradict preval literatur",1
NA,"impact of semantic or phonemic cues in picture naming tasks on the calculation of the objective age of acquisition norms a cross linguistic study","In picture-naming tasks, participants name a picture as quickly as possible. In several studies, when the participant did not provide the picture name in the first seconds after object presentation, the examiner provided phonemic or semantic cues. Under these conditions, word retrieval should be easier, thus lowering the age of acquisition (AoA). The goal of the present study was to collect objective norms of AoA in French without any kind of cue. The results were then compared with other European databases that relied on picture-naming tasks conducted with phonemic or semantic cues. Globally, the data of all the databases are significantly correlated. However, the AoA measures in these databases are always lower than in our study, except in Alvarez and Cuetos (2007), who did not provide any assistance to the participant. Therefore, giving phonemic and/or semantic cues lowers the AoA values, indicating that the values from different databases in this domain should be taken with caution.

NA,"picture naming in 3 to 8 year old french children methodological considerations for name agreement","Picture naming has become an important experimental paradigm in cognitive psychology. Young children are more variable than adults in their naming responses and less likely to know the object or its name. A consequence is that the interpretation of the two classical measures used by Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) for scoring name agreement in adults (the percentage of agreement, based on modal name, and the H statistic, based on alternative names) will differ because of the high rate of ""don't know object"" responses, common in young children, relative to the low rate of ""don't know object"" responses more characteristic of adults. The present study focused on this methodological issue in young French children (3-8 years old), using a set of 145 Snodgrass-Vanderwart pictures.

NA,"evidence for several components of word familiarity","Familiarity with a word can be divided into two main components: familiarity with the form of the word (due to both its lexicality and its specific form) and familiarity with its meaning. In this study, ratings of familiarity were compared for words whose meaning was unknown to participants (UM words), for words of known meaning (KM words), and for unknown words (U words). Linguistic and experiential frequencies were equivalent. Rated familiarity was lower for UM than KM words and even lower for U words. Next, we built pseudowords from these stimuli by changing one letter and submitted them to two familiarity rating tasks that differed in the nature of the additional stimuli: either only nonwords or nonwords plus words. It was assumed that familiarity ratings would be lower for pseudowords built from UM words than for pseudowords built from KM words. The data were consistent with this assumption, and ratings depended on the initial categories of stimuli. These results support the view that usual word familiarity has two components, familiarity with form and familiarity with meaning, and a double source, processing of word form and processing of word meaning.

Subjective frequency was positively and significantly correlated with objective frequency estimates drawn from 10 different sources (r {\textgreater} or = .42).

NA,"beyond the abstractconcrete dichotomy mode of acquisition concreteness imageability familiarity age of acquisition context availability and abstractness norms for a set of 417 italian words","The main objective of this study is to investigate the abstract-concrete dichotomy by introducing a new variable: the mode of acquisition (MoA) of a concept. MoA refers to the way in which concepts are acquired: through experience, through language, or through both. We asked 250 participants to rate 417 words on seven dimensions: age of acquisition, concreteness, familiarity, context availability, imageability, abstractness, and MoA. The data were analyzed by considering MoA ratings and their relationship with the other psycholinguistic variables. Distributions for concreteness, abstractness, and MoA ratings indicate that they are qualitatively different.

The database (LEXVAR.XLS) is freely available for down-loading on the Web site http://wwwistc.ip.rm.cnr.it/materia/database/. For each of the 626 nouns, values for the following variables are reported: age of acquisition, familiarity, imageability, concreteness, adult written frequency, child written frequency, adult spoken frequency, number of orthographic neighbors, mean bigram frequency, length in syllables, and length in letters. A classification of lexical stress and of the type of word-initial phoneme is also provided. The intercorrelations among the variables, a factor analysis, and the effects of variables and of the extracted factors on word naming are reported. Naming latencies were affected primarily by a factor including word length and neighborhood size and by a word frequency factor. Neither a semantic factor including imageability, concreteness, and age of acquisition nor a factor defined by mean bigram frequency had significant effects on pronunciation times. These results hold for a language with shallow orthography, like Italian, for which lexical nonsemantic properties have been shown to affect reading aloud. These norms are useful in a variety of research areas involving the manipulation and control of stimulus attributes.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, {\&} Computers",2002,"Yes","word name time psycholinguist norm italian noun present studi describ normat measur italian simpl noun databas lexvarxl freeli load web site httpwwwistciprmcnrmateriadatabas noun valu variabl report age acquisit familiar imag concret adult written frequenc child written frequenc adult spoken frequenc number orthograph neighbor bigram frequenc length syllabl length letter classif lexic stress type word initi phonem provid intercorrel variabl factor analysi effect variabl extract factor word name report name latenc affect primarili factor includ word length neighborhood size word frequenc factor semant factor includ imag concret age acquisit factor defin bigram frequenc signific effect pronunci time result hold languag shallow orthographi italian lexic nonsemant properti shown affect read aloud norm varieti research area involv manipul control stimulus attribut",1

Current tools allow one either to apply sets of time-stamped codes to the data and consider their timing and sequencing or to describe some specific linguistic structure that is present in the data, built over the top of some form of transcription. To further our understanding of human communication, the research community needs code sets with both timings and structure, designed flexibly to address the research questions at hand. The NITE XML Toolkit offers library support that software developers can call upon when writing tools for such code sets and, thus, enables richer analyses than have previously been possible.

NA,"cloze probability and completion norms for 498 sentences behavioral and neural validation using event related potentials","Three decades after their publication, Bloom and Fischler's (1980) sentence completion norms continue to demonstrate widespread utility. The aim of the present study was to extend this contribution by expanding the existing database of high-constraint, high cloze probability sentences. Using the criteria established by Bloom and Fischler, we constructed 398 new sentences and presented these along with 100 sentences from their original list to be normed using a sample of 400 participants. Of the 498 sentences presented, 400 met criteria for high cloze probability-that is, .67 or higher probability of being completed by a specific single word. Of these, 321 sentences were from the new set and an additional 79 were from Bloom and Fischler's set. A high degree of correspondence was observed between responses obtained by Bloom and Fischler for their high-constraint set. A second experiment utilized an N400 event-related potential paradigm to provide further validation of the contextual constraint for the newly generated set. As expected, N400 amplitude was greater for sentences that violated contextual expectancy by ending in a word other than the newly established completion norm. Sentence completion norms are frequently used in cognitive research, and this larger database of high cloze probability sentences is expected to be of benefit to the research community for many years to come.

Yet, the main criterion for selecting word frequency norms has been the availability of the measure, rather than its quality. As a result, much research is still based on the old Kucera and Francis frequency norms. By using the lexical decision times of recently published megastudies, we show how bad this measure is and what must be done to improve it. In particular, we investigated the size of the corpus, the language register on which the corpus is based, and the definition of the frequency measure. We observed that corpus size is of practical importance for small sizes (depending on the frequency of the word), but not for sizes above 16-30 million words. As for the language register, we found that frequencies based on television and film subtitles are better than frequencies based on written sources, certainly for the monosyllabic and bisyllabic words used in psycholinguistic research. Finally, we found that lemma frequencies are not superior to word form frequencies in English and that a measure of contextual diversity is better than a measure based on raw frequency of occurrence. Part of the superiority of the latter is due to the words that are frequently used as names. Assembling a new frequency norm on the basis of these considerations turned out to predict word processing times much better than did the existing norms (including Kucera {\&} Francis and Celex). The new SUBTL frequency norms from the SUBTLEX(US) corpus are freely available for research purposes from http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/supplemental, as well as from the University of Ghent and Lexique Web sites.","Behavior research methods",2009,"Yes","data interpret statisticalhumanslanguagememorymemori physiologyment processesment process physiologyrecognit psychologyrefer standardsstatisticalvocabulari move kucera franci critic evalu current word frequenc norm introduct improv word frequenc measur american english word frequenc import variabl research word process memori main criterion select word frequenc norm avail measur qualiti result research base kucera franci frequenc norm lexic decis time recent publish megastudi show bad measur improv investig size corpus languag regist corpus base definit frequenc measur observ corpus size practic import small size depend frequenc word size million word languag regist found frequenc base televis film subtitl frequenc base written sourc monosyllab bisyllab word psycholinguist research final found lemma frequenc superior word form frequenc english measur contextu divers measur base raw frequenc occurr part superior due word frequent name assembl frequenc norm basi consider turn predict word process time exist norm includ kucera franci celex subtl frequenc norm subtlex corpus freeli research purpos httpbrmpsychonom journalsorgcontentsupplement univers ghent lexiqu web site",1

We suggest that this uncertainty reflects, in part, stimuli that have not been designed with recent conceptual frameworks in mind or that have been hampered by inadvertent differences between metaphoric and literal conditions. In this article, we begin addressing these shortcomings by developing a large, flexible, extensively normed, and theoretically motivated set of metaphoric and literal sentences. On the basis of the results of three norming studies, we provide 280 pairs of closely matched metaphoric and literal sentences that are characterized along 10 dimensions: length, frequency, concreteness, familiarity, naturalness, imageability, figurativeness, interpretability, valence, and valence judgment reaction time. In addition to allowing for control of these potentially confounding lexical and sentential factors, these stimuli are designed to address questions about the role of novelty, metaphor type, and sensory-motor grounding in determining the neural basis of metaphor comprehension.

"Frequency estimates,Spanish norms,Spoken word frequency,Word frequency","oral frequency norms for 67979 spanish words","Frequency of occurrence is an important attribute of lexical units, and one that is widely used in psychological research and theorization. Although printed frequency norms have long been available for Spanish, and subtitle-based norms have more recently been published, oral frequency norms have not been systematically compiled for a representative set of words. In this study, a corpus of over three million units, representing present-day use of the language in Spain, was used to derive a frequency count of spoken words. The corpus consisted of 913 separate documents that contained transcriptions of oral recordings obtained in a wide variety of situations, mostly radio and television programs. The resulting database, containing absolute and relative frequency values for 67,979 orally produced words, is presented. Validity analyses showed significant correlations of oral frequency with other frequency measures and suggest that oral frequency can predict some types of lexical processing with the same or higher levels of precision, when contrasted with text- or subtitle-based frequencies.

For the first time, lists included words (e.g., bridal, newlyweds, bond, commitment, couple, to marry) simultaneously associated with three critical words (e.g., love, wedding, marriage). Backward associative strength between lists and critical words was taken into account when creating the lists. The results showed that all lists produced false recognition. Moreover, some lists had a high false recognition rate (e.g., 65{\%}; jail, inmate, prison: bars, prisoner, cell, offender, penitentiary, imprisonment). This is an aspect of special interest for those DRM experiments that, for example, record brain electrical activity.

Normally measured through self-report, happiness has often been indirectly characterized and overshadowed by more readily quantifiable economic indicators such as gross domestic product. Here, we examine expressions made on the online, global microblog and social networking service Twitter, uncovering and explaining temporal variations in happiness and information levels over timescales ranging from hours to years. Our data set comprises over 46 billion words contained in nearly 4.6 billion expressions posted over a 33 month span by over 63 million unique users. In measuring happiness, we use a real-time, remote-sensing, non-invasive, text-based approach---a kind of hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets.

The visual impressions were then cross-correlated with a set of memory records whose outputs described the relative probabilities that the stimulus was a given character. This operation described confusion errors. Finally ""response bias"" was described in terms of the reliability with which a memory record provides identification of a given stimulus.

The database contains over 12,000 cue words for which more than 70,000 participants generated three responses in a multiple-response free association task. The goal of this study was (1) to create a semantic network that covers a large part of the human lexicon, (2) to investigate the implications of a multiple-response procedure by deriving a weighted directed network, and (3) to show how measures of centrality and relatedness derived from this network predict both lexical access in a lexical decision task and semantic relatedness in similarity judgment tasks. First, our results show that the multiple-response procedure results in a more heterogeneous set of responses, which lead to better predictions of lexical access and semantic relatedness than do single-response procedures. Second, the directed nature of the network leads to a decomposition of centrality that primarily depends on the number of incoming links or in-degree of each node, rather than its set size or number of outgoing links. Both studies indicate that adequate representation formats and sufficiently rich data derived from word associations represent a valuable type of information in both lexical and semantic processing.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"Yes","lexic centralitylex decisionsemant networksemant relatednessword associ explan lexic semant cognit network deriv continu singl word associ articl describ extens set word associ collect date databas cue word particip generat respons multipl respons free associ task goal studi creat semant network cover larg part human lexicon investig implic multipl respons procedur deriv weight direct network show measur central related deriv network predict lexic access lexic decis task semant related similar judgment task result show multipl respons procedur result heterogen set respons lead predict lexic access semant related singl respons procedur direct natur network lead decomposit central primarili depend number incom link degre node set size number outgo link studi adequ represent format suffici rich data deriv word associ repres valuabl type inform lexic semant process",1

NA,"variability in early communicative development","Data from parent reports on 1,803 children--derived from a normative study of the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs)--are used to describe the typical course and the extent of variability in major features of communicative development between 8 and 30 months of age. The two instruments, one designed for 8-16-month-old infants, the other for 16-30-month-old toddlers, are both reliable and valid, confirming the value of parent reports that are based on contemporary behavior and a recognition format. Growth trends are described for children scoring at the 10th-, 25th-, 50th-, 75th-, and 90th-percentile levels on receptive and expressive vocabulary, actions and gestures, and a number of aspects of morphology and syntax. Extensive variability exists in the rate of lexical, gestural, and grammatical development. The wide variability across children in the time of onset and course of acquisition of these skills challenges the meaningfulness of the concept of the modal child. At the same time, moderate to high intercorrelations are found among the different skills both concurrently and predictively (across a 6-month period). Sex differences consistently favor females; however, these are very small, typically accounting for 1{\%}-2{\%} of the variance. The effects of SES and birth order are even smaller within this age range. The inventories offer objective criteria for defining typicality and exceptionality, and their cost effectiveness facilitates the aggregation of large data sets needed to address many issues of contemporary theoretical interest. The present data also offer unusually detailed information on the course of development of individual lexical, gestural, and grammatical items and features. Adaptations of the CDIs to other languages have opened new possibilities for cross-linguistic explorations of sequence, rate, and variability of communicative development.","Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development",1994,"Yes","variabl earli communic develop data parent report children deriv normat studi macarthur communic develop inventori cdis describ typic extent variabl major featur communic develop month age instrument design month infant month toddler reliabl valid confirm parent report base contemporari behavior recognit format growth trend children score th th th th th percentil level recept express vocabulari action gestur number aspect morpholog syntax extens variabl exist rate lexic gestur grammat develop wide variabl children time onset acquisit skill challeng meaning concept modal child time moder high intercorrel found skill concurr predict month period sex differ consist favor femal small typic account varianc effect ses birth order smaller age rang inventori offer object criteria defin typic except cost effect facilit aggreg larg data set need address issu contemporari theoret interest present data offer unusu detail inform develop individu lexic gestur grammat item featur adapt cdis languag open possibl cross linguist explor sequenc rate variabl communic develop",1

"Linguistic context,Polysemy,Semantic ambiguity,Semantic cognition","semantic diversity a measure of semantic ambiguity based on variability in the contextual usage of words","Semantic ambiguity is typically measured by sum-ming the number of senses or dictionary definitions that a word has. Such measures are somewhat subjective and may not adequately capture the full extent of variation in word meaning, particularly for polysemous words that can be used in many different ways, with subtle shifts in meaning. Here, we describe an alternative, computationally derived measure of ambiguity based on the proposal that the meanings of words vary continuously as a function of their contexts. On this view, words that appear in a wide range of contexts on diverse topics are more variable in meaning than those that appear in a restricted set of similar contexts. To quantify this variation, we performed latent semantic analysis on a large text corpus to estimate the semantic similarities of different linguistic contexts. From these estimates, we calculated the degree to which the different contexts associated with a given word vary in their meanings. We term this quantity a word's semantic diversity (SemD). We suggest that this approach provides an objective way of quantifying the subtle, context-dependent variations in word meaning that are often present in language. We demonstrate that SemD is correlated with other measures of ambiguity and contextual variability, as well as with frequency and imageability. We also show that SemD is a strong predictor of performance in semantic judgments in healthy individuals and in patients with semantic deficits, accounting for unique variance beyond that of other predictors. SemD values for over 30,000 English words are provided as supplementary materials.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"Yes","linguist contextpolysemysemant ambiguitysemant cognit semant divers measur semant ambigu base variabl contextu usag word semant ambigu typic measur sum ming number sens dictionari definit word measur subject adequ captur full extent variat word mean polysem word way subtl shift mean describ altern comput deriv measur ambigu base propos mean word vari continu function context view word wide rang context divers topic variabl mean restrict set similar context quantifi variat perform latent semant analysi larg text corpus estim semant similar linguist context estim calcul degre context word vari mean term quantiti word semant divers semd suggest approach object quantifi subtl context depend variat word mean present languag demonstr semd correl measur ambigu contextu variabl frequenc imag show semd strong predictor perform semant judgment healthi individu patient semant deficit account uniqu varianc predictor semd valu english word provid supplementari materi",1

NA,"prototypicality distinctiveness and intercorrelation analyses of the semantic attributes of living and nonliving concepts","Many cognitive psychological, computational, and neuropsychological approaches to the organisation of semantic memory have incorporated the idea that concepts are, at least partly, represented in terms of their fine-grained features. We asked 20 normal volunteers to provide properties of 64 concrete items, drawn from living and nonliving categories, by completing simple sentence stems (e.g., an owl is {\_}{\_}, has {\_}{\_}, can{\_}{\_}). At a later date, the same participants rated the same concepts for prototypicality and familiarity. The features generated were classified as to type of knowledge (sensory, functional, or encyclopaedic), and also quantified with regard to both dominance (the number of participants specifying that property for that concept) and distinctiveness (the proportion of exemplars within a conceptual category of which that feature was considered characteristic). The results demonstrate that rated prototypicality is related to both the familiarity of the concept and its distance from the average of the exemplars within the same category (the category centroid). The feature database was also used to replicate, resolve, and extend a variety of previous observations on the structure of semantic representations. Specifically, the results of our analyses (1) resolve two conflicting claims regarding the relative ratio of sensory to other kinds of attributes in living vs. nonliving concepts; (2) offer new information regarding the types of features-across different domains-that distinguish concepts from their category coordinates; and (3) corroborate some previous claims of higher intercorrelations between features of living things than those of artefacts.","Cognitive Neuropsychology",2001,"Yes","prototyp distinct intercorrel analys semant attribut live nonliv concept cognit psycholog comput neuropsycholog approach organis semant memori incorpor idea concept part repres term fine grain featur ask normal volunt provid properti concret item drawn live nonliv categori complet simpl sentenc stem owl date particip rate concept prototyp familiar featur generat classifi type knowledg sensori function encyclopaed quantifi regard domin number particip properti concept distinct proport exemplar conceptu categori featur consid characterist result demonstr rate prototyp relat familiar concept distanc averag exemplar categori categori centroid featur databas replic resolv extend varieti previous observ structur semant represent specif result analys resolv conflict claim relat ratio sensori kind attribut live nonliv concept offer inform type featur domain distinguish concept categori coordin corrobor previous claim higher intercorrel featur live thing artefact",1

Our study did not reveal marked differences across sex groups. The database compiled here should become a useful tool for experimental studies in which verbal material is used with children.

NA,"body object interaction ratings for 1618 monosyllabic nouns","Body-object interaction (BOI) assesses the ease with which a human body can physically interact with a word's referent. Recent research has shown that BOI influences visual word recognition processes in such a way that responses to high-BOI words (e.g., couch) are faster and less error prone than responses to low-BOI words (e.g., cliff). Importantly, the high-BOI words and the low-BOI words that were used in those studies were matched on imageability. In the present study, we collected BOI ratings for a large set of words. BOI ratings, on a 1-7 scale, were obtained for 1,618 monosyllabic nouns. These ratings allowed us to test the generalizability of BOI effects to a large set of items, and they should be useful to researchers who are interested in manipulating or controlling for the effects of BOI.

"priming technique application, cognitive represent","cognitive representations of semantic categories","Conducted 9 experiments with a total of 663 undergraduates using the technique of priming to study the nature of the cognitive representation generated by superordinate semantic category names. In Exp I, norms for the internal structure of 10 categories were collected. In Exps II, III, and IV, internal structure was found to affect the perceptual encoding of physically identical pairs of stimuli, facilitating responses to physically identical good members and hindering responses to identical poor members of a category. Exps V and VI showed that the category name did not generate a physical code (e.g., lines or angles), but rather affected perception of the stimuli at the level of meaning. Exps VII and VIII showed that while the representation of the category name which affected perception contained a depth meaning common to words and pictures which enabled Ss to prepare for either stimulus form within 700 msec, selective reduction of the interval between prime and stimulus below 700 msec revealed differentiation of the coding of meaning in preparation for actual perception. Exp IX suggested that good examples of semantic categories are not physiologically determined, as the effects of the internal structure of semantic categories on priming (unlike the effects for color categories) could be eliminated by long practice.","Journal of Experimental Psychology: General",1975,"Yes","prime techniqu applic cognit repres cognit represent semant categori conduct experi total undergradu techniqu prime studi natur cognit represent generat superordin semant categori name exp norm intern structur categori collect exp ii iii iv intern structur found affect perceptu encod physic ident pair stimuli facilit respons physic ident good member hinder respons ident poor member categori exp vi show categori generat physic code line angl affect percept stimuli level mean exp vii viii show represent categori affect percept contain depth mean common word pictur enabl ss prepar stimulus form msec select reduct interv prime stimulus msec reveal differenti code mean prepar actual percept exp ix suggest good exampl semant categori physiolog determin effect intern structur semant categori prime unlik effect color categori elimin long practic",1

Measures include valence, approach/avoidance tendencies associated with the trait, possessor- and other-relevance of the trait, and discrete emotions conveyed by the trait (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness). The normative data were obtained from 328 participants and were revealed to be stable across samples and gender. These data go beyond a dimensional structure and consider more fine-grained descriptions such as the categorical emotions, as well as the perspective of the evaluator conveyed by the traits.

Additionally, these letter similarity/confusability matrices have been useful for studies examining more general aspects of human cognition, such as perception. Despite many letter visual-similarity matrices being available, they all have two serious limitations if they are to be used by researchers in the reading domain: (1) They have been constructed using atypical reading data obtained from speeded reading-aloud tasks and/or under degraded presentation conditions; (2) they only include letters from the English alphabet. Although some letter visual-similarity matrices have been constructed using data gathered from normal reading conditions, these either are based on old fonts, which may not resemble the letters found in modern print, or were never published. For the first time, this article presents a comprehensive letter visual-similarity/confusability matrix that has been constructed based on untimed responses to clearly presented upper- and lowercase letters that are present in many languages that use Latin-based alphabets, including Catalan, Dutch, English, French, Galician, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.

"Vector quantization,dynamic time warping,speaker adaptation","vector quantization for speaker adaptation results on a 5000 word database","With a view to designing a speaker-independent large vocabulary recognition system, we evaluate a vector quantization approach for speaker adaptation. Only one speaker (the reference speaker) pronounces the application vocabulary. He also pronounces a small vocabulary called the adaptation vocabulary. Each new speaker then merely pronounces the adaptation vocabulary. We have compared two adaptation methods, establishing a correspondence between the codebooks of the reference and the new speakers, on a 20-speaker database with a 104-word application vocabulary. Method I uses a transposed codebook to represent the new speaker during the recognition process, whereas Method II uses a codebook which is obtained by clustering analysis on the NS's pronunciation of the adaptation vocabulary. The adaptation vocabulary contains 136 words. Comparison of the performance of the two methods shows that a new speaker's codebook is not necessary to represent the new speaker. Consequently we have used the first method to perform tests with a 5000-word application vocabulary, and a 4-speaker database. The adaptation is still efficient (the mean improvement is about 14{\%}), even if the relative improvement is 30{\%} compared to 56{\%} obtained in the 104-word application experiment. Further experiments show that the recognition accuracy can be improved by increasing the adaptation vocabulary size and the codebook size. {\textcopyright} 1991.","Speech Communication",1991,"Yes","vector quantizationdynam time warpingspeak adapt vector quantiz speaker adapt result word databas view design speaker independ larg vocabulari recognit system evalu vector quantiz approach speaker adapt speaker refer speaker pronounc applic vocabulari pronounc small vocabulari call adapt vocabulari speaker pronounc adapt vocabulari compar adapt method establish correspond codebook refer speaker speaker databas word applic vocabulari method transpos codebook repres speaker recognit process method ii codebook obtain cluster analysi ns pronunci adapt vocabulari adapt vocabulari word comparison perform method show speaker codebook repres speaker method perform test word applic vocabulari speaker databas adapt effici improv relat improv compar obtain word applic experi experi show recognit accuraci improv increas adapt vocabulari size codebook size textcopyright",1

Children's name agreement was lower than that of adults. The children also failed to provide adequate modal names for 103 concepts, rated drawings as less familiar and less complex, and chose shorter names for pictures. The differences in ratings between adults and children were higher than those observed in the literature employing smaller picture sets.

In Experiment 1, 5-year-olds made age-of-acquisition (AOA) estimates for a set of words that were very similar to estimates made by older children and adults. In Experiment 2, young children's picture recognition, mispronunciation detection, and vocabulary monitoring performance all varied systematically with these AOA estimates and with a stimulus-type (intact-mispronounced) manipulation. Subjective AOA estimates (whether from children or from adults) proved to be a better predictor of performance than did two objective familiarity measures and subjective imageability. These results point to considerable metalexical knowledge on the part of young children or explicit sensitivity regarding their own vocabulary knowledge. In addition, the results lend some support to the notion that actual AOA contributes to subjective AOA estimates.","Memory {\&} Cognition",1992,"Yes","young children age acquisit estim spoken word studi concern impact stimulus familiar young children abil recogn spoken word make explicit judgment experi year old made age acquisit aoa estim set word similar estim made older children adult experi young children pictur recognit mispronunci detect vocabulari monitor perform vari systemat aoa estim stimulus type intact mispronounc manipul subject aoa estim children adult prove predictor perform object familiar measur subject imag result point consider metalex knowledg part young children explicit sensit vocabulari knowledg addit result lend support notion actual aoa contribut subject aoa estim",1

NA,"adding semantic roles to the chinese treebank","We report work on adding semantic role labels to the Chinese Treebank, a corpus already annotated with phrase structures. The work involves locating all verbs and their nominalizations in the corpus, and semi-automatically adding semantic role labels to their arguments, which are constituents in a parse tree. Although the same procedure is followed, different issues arise in the annotation of verbs and nominalized predicates. For verbs, identifying their arguments is generally straightforward given their syntactic structure in the Chinese Treebank as they tend to occupy well-defined syntactic positions. Our discussion focuses on the syntactic variations in the realization of the arguments as well as our approach to annotating dislocated and discontinuous arguments. In comparison, identifying the arguments for nominalized predicates is more challenging and we discuss criteria and procedures for distinguishing arguments from non-arguments. In particular we focus on the role of support verbs as well as the relevance of event/result distinctions in the annotation of the predicate-argument structure of nominalized predicates. We also present our approach to taking advantage of the syntactic structure in the Chinese Treebank to bootstrap the predicate-argument structure annotation of verbs. Finally, we discuss the creation of a lexical database of frame files and its role in guiding predicate-argument annotation.

NA,"corroborating biased indicators global and local agreement among objective and subjective estimates of printed word frequency","The internal validity of several types of experiments in experimental psychology and neuroscience depends in part on the possibility of controlling or manipulating critical lexical variables such as word frequency of occurrence. Two ways of estimating this variable are (1) objective frequency counts and (2) subjective ratings of word frequency. Each method produces estimates that generally agree (i.e., they are highly correlated) but that disagree substantially concerning the relative frequency of a number of words. To investigate this issue more closely, the global and local agreement of subjective frequency estimates was examined in detail for a pool of 6,202 words drawn from the OMNILEX database of French words (Desrochers, 2006; www.omnilex.uottawa.ca). The results indicated that objective and subjective frequencies are strongly correlated, subjective frequencies share a significant amount of bias variance with other lexical characteristics (e.g., imageability), and the codeterminants of subjective frequency are in an antagonistic relationship with one another.

False recall and false recognition of the critical target occurred frequently in response to these lists. The purpose of the current work was to provide a set of normative data for the lists Roediger and McDermott used and for 12 others developed more recently. We tested false recall and false recognition for critical targets from 36 lists. Despite the fact that all lists were constructed to produce false remembering, the diversity in their effectiveness was large--60{\%} or more of subjects falsely recalled window and sleep following the appropriate lists, and false recognition for these items was greater than 80{\%}. However, the list generated from king led to 10{\%} false recall and 27{\%} false recognition. Possible reasons for these wide differences in effectiveness of the lists are discussed.

NA,"alphabetic confusion a test of models for individuals","An earlier article reported extensive analyses of confusion data compiled from group averages (Townsend, 1971). The present study provided for essentially the same analyses with different long-term data obtained with two individuals, the primary intent being to examine the ability of recognition and scaling models to explain data at the individual level (which the recognition models purport to describe) and to compare the confusion characteristics of the English uppercase alphabet between the two Ss and between the individual Ss and the group-averaged data. The choice and overlap models were superior to the all-or-none model in predicting the empirical confusion matrices and tended to explain the data structure in a similar manner. Multidimensional scaling analysis again supported a Euclidean metric and suggested four or five underlying stimulus dimensions. However, as before, there were no overriding intuitively appealing psychological dimensions corresponding to these, and possible reasons are discussed. The choice and overlap models appeared to fit as well or better at the individual level than at the group level and the all-or-none model to fit worse. In the present study, probability correct was fit even better by the all-or-none model than in the group study and replicated the result of being better here than the overlap and choice models. Individuals and the group were consistent in their sensory confusions as represented by similarity parameters in the choice and overlap models but differed in their response biases.

In addition, the backward association strength based on Nelson et al.

The experiment included a large number of items and a large sample of participants. In order to make this experiment as similar as possible to classic picture naming experiments, participants were familiarized with the materials during a training session. Speeded naming latencies were determined by a software key on the basis of the digital recording of the responses. The effects of various variables on these latencies were assessed with multiple regression techniques, using a repeated measures design.

NA,"discrete emotion effects on lexical decision response times","Our knowledge about affective processes, especially concerning effects on cognitive demands like word processing, is increasing steadily. Several studies consistently document valence and arousal effects, and although there is some debate on possible interactions and different notions of valence, broad agreement on a two dimensional model of affective space has been achieved. Alternative models like the discrete emotion theory have received little interest in word recognition research so far. Using backward elimination and multiple regression analyses, we show that five discrete emotions (i.e., happiness, disgust, fear, anger and sadness) explain as much variance as two published dimensional models assuming continuous or categorical valence, with the variables happiness, disgust and fear significantly contributing to this account. Moreover, these effects even persist in an experiment with discrete emotion conditions when the stimuli are controlled for emotional valence and arousal levels. We interpret this result as evidence for discrete emotion effects in visual word recognition that cannot be explained by the two dimensional affective space account.","PLoS ONE",2011,"Yes","discret emot effect lexic decis respons time knowledg affect process effect cognit demand word process increas steadili studi consist document valenc arous effect debat interact notion valenc broad agreement dimension model affect space achiev altern model discret emot theori receiv interest word recognit research backward elimin multipl regress analys show discret emot happi disgust fear anger sad explain varianc publish dimension model assum continu categor valenc variabl happi disgust fear signific contribut account effect persist experi discret emot condit stimuli control emot valenc arous level interpret result evid discret emot effect visual word recognit explain dimension affect space account",1

NA,"a web based program for coding open ended response protocols","A Web-based coding application was designed to improve coding efficiency and to provide a systematic means of evaluating responses to open-ended assessments. The system was developed for use by multiple raters to assign open-ended responses to predetermined categories. The application provides a software environment for efficiently supervising the work of coders and evaluating the quality of the coding by (1) systematically presenting open-ended responses to coders, (2) tracking each coder's categorized responses, and (3) assessing interrater consistency at any time in order to identify coders in need of further training. In addition, the application can be set to automatically assign repeated responses to categories previously identified as appropriate for those responses. To evaluate the efficacy of the coding application and to determine the statistical reliability of coding open-ended data within this application, we examined data from two empirical studies. The results demonstrated substantial interrater agreement on items assigned to various categories across free and controlled association tasks. Overall, this new coding application provides a feasible method of reliably coding open-ended data and makes the task of coding these data more manageable.

NA,"theoretical analysis of an alphabetic confusion matrix","A study was undertaken to acquire a confusion matrix of the entire upper-case English alphabet with a simple nonserifed font under tachistoscopic conditions. This was accomplished with two experimental conditions, one with blank poststimulus field and one with noisy poststimulus field, for six Ss run 650 trials each. Three mathematical models of recognition, two based on the concept of a finite number of sensory states and one being the choice model, were compared in their ability to predict the confusion matrix after their parameters were estimated from functions of the data. In order to ascertain the facility with which estimates of similarity among the letters could lead to a psychological space containing the letters, $\eta$ ij, the similarity parameter of the choice model was input to an ordinally based multidimensional scaling program. Finally, correlation coefficients were computed among parameters of the models, the scaled space, and a crude measure of physical similarity. Briefly, the results were: (1) the finite-state model that assumed stimulus similarity (the overlap activation model) and the choice model predicted the confusion-matrix entries about equally well in terms of a sum-of-squared deviations criterion and better than the all-or-none activation model, which assumed only a perfect perception or random-guessing state following a stimulus presentation; (2) the parts of the confusion matrix that fit best varied with the particular model, and this finding was related to the models; (3) the best scaling result in terms of a goodness-of-fit measure was obtained with the blank poststimulus field condition, with a technique allowing different distances for tied similarity values, and with the Euclidean as opposed to the city-block metric; and (4) there was agreement among the models in terms of the way in which the models reflected sensory and response bias structure in the data, and in the way in which a single model measured these attributes across experimental conditions, as well as agreement among similarity ami distance measures with physical Similarity. {\textcopyright} 1971 Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Perception {\&} Psychophysics",1971,"Yes","theoret analysi alphabet confus matrix studi undertaken acquir confus matrix entir upper case english alphabet simpl nonserif font tachistoscop condit accomplish experiment condit blank poststimulus field noisi poststimulus field ss run trial mathemat model recognit base concept finit number sensori state choic model compar abil predict confus matrix paramet estim function data order ascertain facil estim similar letter lead psycholog space letter eta ij similar paramet choic model input ordin base multidimension scale program final correl coeffici comput paramet model scale space crude measur physic similar briefli result finit state model assum stimulus similar overlap activ model choic model predict confus matrix entri equal term sum squar deviat criterion activ model assum perfect percept random guess state stimulus present part confus matrix fit vari model find relat model scale result term good fit measur obtain blank poststimulus field condit techniqu allow distanc tie similar valu euclidean oppos citi block metric agreement model term model reflect sensori respons bias structur data singl model measur attribut experiment condit agreement similar ami distanc measur physic similar textcopyright psychonom societi",1

The strong similarity of the visual and tactile matrices from this study lends additional support to the claim that visual recognition of low-pass filtered characters, to a first approximation, can be taken as a model of tactile recognition of small two-dimensional raised patterns.

NA,"tactile letter recognition under different modes of stimulus presentation","Block capital letters were displayed to experienced and inexperienced Ss, using a 20 x 20 matrix of vibratory tactors placed against the back. In two separate experiments, a total of five modes of stimulus presentation. three of them employing a linear scanning slit, were studied. The poorest method, stationary flashing of the letter, allows performance that is well above chance, implying that a purely spatial presentation does convey information. Performance is improved when the letter is moved horizontally across the display. The best performance is achieved when the amount of simultaneous stimulation is limited by using a linear scanning slit. In one method, the letter moves behind a stationary slit, with the result that its horizontal dimension is portrayed only in time. In the other two methods, the scanning slit moves across the stationary letter, portraying the letter both in time and in space. The results of all five display modes indicate that Ss can use whichever representation, spatial or temporal, is available, although patternings which most closely approximate sequential tracing by a single moving point lead to the highest recognition accuracy. We interpret these results in terms of the limited spatial resolution of the cutaneous sense. While the perception of a letter presented in either full-field condition is limited by the spatial resolution, the best measure being the two-point limen, the perception of a letter traced sequentially is limited by the localization acuity of the cutaneous sense, the best measure being the ""error of localization,"" which is known to be considerably smaller than the two-point limen. Inasmuch as the slit methods of presentation are a compromise between simultaneous and sequential display, letter-recognition accuracy ia better with slit presentation than with the corresponding full-field mode of display.","Perception {\&} Psychophysics",1974,"Yes","tactil letter recognit mode stimulus present block capit letter display experienc inexperienc ss matrix vibratori tactor back separ experi total mode stimulus present employ linear scan slit studi poorest method stationari flash letter perform chanc impli pure spatial present convey inform perform improv letter move horizont display perform achiev amount simultan stimul limit linear scan slit method letter move stationari slit result horizont dimens portray time method scan slit move stationari letter portray letter time space result display mode ss whichev represent spatial tempor pattern close approxim sequenti trace singl move point lead highest recognit accuraci interpret result term limit spatial resolut cutan sens percept letter present full field condit limit spatial resolut measur point limen percept letter trace sequenti limit local acuiti cutan sens measur error local consider smaller point limen slit method present compromis simultan sequenti display letter recognit accuraci ia slit present full field mode display",1

It is important that the effect of the relevant design choices and parameter values are understood if psychological models using these methods are to be reliably evaluated and compared. In this article, we present a systematic exploration of the principal computational possibilities for formulating and validating representations of word meanings from word co-occurrence statistics. We find that, once we have identified the best procedures, a very simple approach is surprisingly successful and robust over a range of psychologically relevant evaluation measures.","Behavior Research Methods",2007,"Yes","data interpretationhumansmodelspsychologicalsemanticsstatisticalvocabulari extract semant represent word occurr statist comput studi idea aspect word mean induc pattern word occurr increas popular agreement precis comput involv test distinguish possibl import effect relev design choic paramet valu understood psycholog model method reliabl evalu compar articl present systemat explor princip comput possibl formul valid represent word mean word occurr statist find identifi procedur simpl approach surpris success robust rang psycholog relev evalu measur",1
NA,"a cross culturally standardized set of pictures for younger and older adults american and chinese norms for name agreement concept agreement and familiarity","The present study presents normative measures for 260 line drawings of everyday objects, found in Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980), viewed by individuals in China and the United States. Within each cultural group, name agreement, concept agreement, and familiarity measures were obtained separately for younger adults and older adults. For a subset of 57 pictures (22{\%}), there was equivalence in both name agreement and concept agreement, and for an additional subset of 29 pictures (11{\%}), there was nonequivalent name agreement but equivalent concept agreement, across all culture-by-age groups. The data indicate substantial differences across culture-by-age groups in name agreement percentages and number of distinct name responses provided. We discovered significant differences between older and younger American adults in both name agreement percentages (67 pictures, or 26{\%}) and concept agreement percentages (44 pictures, or 17{\%}). Written naming responses collected for the entire set of Snodgrass and Vanderwart pictures showed shifts in both naming and concept agreement percentages over the intervening decades: Although correlations in name agreement were strong (r = .71, p {\textless} .001) between our younger American samples and those of Snodgrass and Vanderwart, name agreement percentages have changed for a substantial proportion (33{\%}) of the 260 pictures; moreover, 63{\%} of the stimuli for which Snodgrass and Vanderwart reported concept agreement now appear to differ. We provide comprehensive comparison statistics and tests for both the present study and prior ones, finding differences across numerous item-level measures. The corpus of data suggests that substantial differences in all measures can be found across age as well as culture, so that unequivocal conclusions with respect to cross-cultural or age-related differences in cognition can be made only when appropriate stimuli are selected for studies.

Half of the words in each language received more than a single translation across participants. Cue word frequency and imageability were both negatively correlated with number of translations. Word class predicted number of translations: Nouns had fewer translations than did verbs, which had fewer translations than class-ambiguous items. The translation probability of specific responses was positively correlated with target word frequency and imageability, and with its form overlap with the cue word. Translation choice was modulated by L2 proficiency: Less proficient bilinguals tended to produce lower probability translations than more proficient bilinguals, but only in forward translation, from Ll to L2. These findings highlight the importance of translation ambiguity as a factor influencing bilingual representation and performance. The norms can also provide an important resource to assist researchers in the selection of experimental materials for studies of bilingual and monolingual language performance.

NA,"a comparative quantitative analysis of greek orthographic transparency","Orthographic transparency refers to the systematicity in the mapping between orthographic letter sequences and phonological phoneme sequences in both directions, for reading and spelling. Measures of transparency previously used in the analysis of orthographies of other languages include regularity, consistency, and entropy. However, previous reports have typically been hampered by severe restrictions, such as using only monosyllables or only word-initial phonemes. Greek is sufficiently transparent to allow complete sequential alignment between graphemes and phonemes, therefore permitting full analyses at both letter and grapheme levels, using every word in its entirety. Here, we report multiple alternative measures of transparency, using both type and token counts, and compare these with estimates for other languages. We discuss the problems stemming from restricted analysis sets and the implications for psycholinguistic experimentation and computational modeling of reading and spelling.","Behavior Research Methods",2009,"Yes","compar quantit analysi greek orthograph transpar orthograph transpar refer systemat map orthograph letter sequenc phonolog phonem sequenc direct read spell measur transpar previous analysi orthographi languag includ regular consist entropi previous report typic hamper sever restrict monosyl word initi phonem greek suffici transpar complet sequenti align graphem phonem permit full analys letter graphem level word entireti report multipl altern measur transpar type token count compar estim languag discuss problem stem restrict analysi set implic psycholinguist experiment comput model read spell",1

Two experiments were conducted. In the first, participants were asked to list verbs within 10 semantic categories (e.g. breaking, cleaning, cooking, etc.) and 10 noun categories (e.g. animals, fruit, tools, etc.). In the second experiment, participants were asked to rate the typicality of verbs within 8 of the previously investigated verb categories. Although participants listed fewer verbs in verb categories than nouns in noun categories, the overall patterns with regard to correlation analyses between production frequency, mean rank of responses, lexical frequency, and typicality were consistent with those observed in noun categories. These patterns are also consistent with those observed in previous research.

NA,"the representation of ontological category concepts as affected by healthy aging normative data and theoretical implications","Attributes associated with concept representations, such as familiarity, typicality, and age of acquisition, have been shown to be important influences on lexical-semantic processing. In most previous studies of healthy and pathological aging, these attributes are not equated for younger and older adults separately on the stimuli used. In this study, normative data were collected to test whether there exist any age differences in these attributes. The results demonstrate that the ratings given by younger and older adults on natural and manmade category items correlated positively. However, age differences were also apparent, whereby older adults provided higher ratings overall than younger adults. Suggestions and hypotheses are presented to explain this pattern of age differences, which relate to how category concepts may be represented by healthy younger and older adults. Also, the possible implications for these differential age ratings on lexical-semantic processing are discussed. The age differences apparent in this study demonstrate the need to consider age-appropriate normative ratings in the selection of stimuli for use in lexical-semantic processing studies of aging, and the normative data presented provide a means of equating category stimuli.

NA,"university of alberta norms of relative meaning frequency for 566 homographs","For many models oflexical ambiguity resolution, relative frequency of the different meanings of homographs (words with more than one meaning) is crucial. Although several homograph as-sociation norms have been published in the past, none has involved a large number of subjects responding to a large number of homographs, and most homograph norming studies are now at least a decade old. In Experiment 1, associations to 566 homographs were collected from an aver-age of 192 subjects per homograph. Frequency of occurrence for the three most common mean-ings is reported, along with the corresponding associates, and a measure of the overall ambiguity of each homograph. Homographs whose meanings differed in part of speech were more ambigu-ous overall than homographs whose different meanings belonged to a single grammatical class. Homographs whose pronunciation depended on meaning (heterophones) were no more ambigu-ous than nonheterophones, and word frequency was unrelated to overall ambiguity. Estimates of homograph balance across different norming studies were compared, and homographs with two meanings of approximately equal relative meaning frequency (balanced homographs) and homographs with one clearly dominant meaning (polarized homographs) were identified. In Ex-periment 2, reliability of meaning categorizations was measured for a subset of the homographs in the first experiment. Meaning categorizations were shown to be highly reliable across raters. Homographs are words that have more than one mean-ing but share the same orthography. They most often also share phonology (e.g., a dog's bark vs. a tree's bark; a fireplace poker vs. a poker game), but a few English homographs have distinct phonologies for their different meanings. For these heterophonic homographs, pronun-ciation depends on meaning; examples are ""bass"" (fish vs. guitar) and ""wind"" (gale vs. to coil). Contrary to in-tuition, homographs are not an obscure class of linguistic items. Rather, homographs could be considered impor-tant topics of study solely because of their abundance in English.

NA,"meaning dominance norms for 120 homographs","Over the past two decades, homographs have been used in psychological experiments aimed at testing a variety of theoretical issues concerning memory and language. Often, such research requires prior knowledge of the dominance relations among various meanings of the homographs. Previously available homograph meaning norms are limited because they are now more than 10 years old, and they have typically reported only the two most dominant meanings even though many homographs have three or more common meanings. This paper presents normative data on 120 homographs from a relatively large, heterogeneous sample of subjects (N = 100). Meaning dominance was assessed by having subjects write the first definition that came to mind for each homograph. Definition responses were grouped by similarity, and the resulting meaning categories were verified against dictionary meaning classifications.

"Free associate classification,Homonyms,Homonymy disadvantage,Norming methods,Rating dictionary definitions,Relative meaning frequency,Semantic ambiguity","edom norming software and relative meaning frequencies for 544 english homonyms","Words that are homonyms-that is, for which a single written and spoken form is associated with multiple, unrelated interpretations, such as COMPOUND, which can denote an {\textless} enclosure {\textgreater} or a {\textless} composite {\textgreater} meaning-are an invaluable class of items for studying word and discourse comprehension. When using homonyms as stimuli, it is critical to control for the relative frequencies of each interpretation, because this variable can drastically alter the empirical effects of homonymy. Currently, the standard method for estimating these frequencies is based on the classification of free associates generated for a homonym, but this approach is both assumption-laden and resource-demanding. Here, we outline an alternative norming methodology based on explicit ratings of the relative meaning frequencies of dictionary definitions. To evaluate this method, we collected and analyzed data in a norming study involving 544 English homonyms, using the eDom norming software that we developed for this purpose. Dictionary definitions were generally sufficient to exhaustively cover word meanings, and the methods converged on stable norms with fewer data and less effort on the part of the experimenter. The predictive validity of the norms was demonstrated in analyses of lexical decision data from the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445-459, 2007), and from Armstrong and Plaut (Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, 2223-2228, 2011). On the basis of these results, our norming method obviates relying on the unsubstantiated assumptions involved in estimating relative meaning frequencies on the basis of classification of free associates.

Thus, the orthographic neighbor ratio provides a measure of a sophisticated guessing model in which partial information about a word is obtained and a decision is made on the basis of the relative frequencies of the possible responses. Correlations with existing norms are reported.","Behavior Research Methods {\&} Instrumentation",1981,"Yes","order approxim english order approxim english orthograph neighbor ratio norm noun order approxim english orthograph neighbor ratio valu provid paivio yuill madigan noun order approxim english inform theori measur probabl generat word letter letter basi orthograph neighbor ratio frequenc word divid sum frequenc word generat chang letter orthograph neighbor ratio measur sophist guess model partial inform word obtain decis made basi relat frequenc respons correl exist norm report",1
NA,"comprehension of semantic relationships and the generality of categorization models","Six groups of subjects rated word pairs for the degree to which they exemplified one of six semantic relationships. The relationships that subjects were instructed to rate were antonymy, synonymity, subordination, superordination, coordination, and similarity. Stimulus pairs represented antonyms, synonyms, subordinates, superordinates, and coordinates. The pairs representing each stimulus relationship varied across four levels of typicality, ranging from good examples of the relationship to unrelated pairs. The highest rating in each group was given to the stimulus relationship corresponding to the relationship being judged (e.g., antonyms received the highest rating under antonym judgment instructions). This interaction was strongest for high-typicality pairs and decreased across the levels of typicality. Semantic decision models cannot explain these results unless the models are modified so that decisions are based on relationship similarity, the degree to which a stimulus pair exemplifies the relationship subjects are instructed to judge.","Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society",1981,"Yes","comprehens semant relationship general categor model group subject rate word pair degre exemplifi semant relationship relationship subject instruct rate antonymi synonym subordin superordin coordin similar stimulus pair repres antonym synonym subordin superordin coordin pair repres stimulus relationship vari level typic rang good exampl relationship unrel pair highest rate group stimulus relationship relationship judg antonym receiv highest rate antonym judgment instruct interact strongest high typic pair decreas level typic semant decis model explain result model modifi decis base relationship similar degre stimulus pair exemplifi relationship subject instruct judg",1

In Exp 1, 96 kindergartners (aged 4.3-6 yrs) generated typicality for items belonging to each of 4 categories. The same Ss participated in Exp 2, in which they were asked to generate attributes for the members of 4 categories for the benefit of 2 people from another planet who had no knowledge about the particular items. In Exp 3, with 120 university students (aged 19-21.3 yrs), the correspondence between adults' family resemblance and typicality ratings on the same materials was tested. Results show that the procedure cannot be reliably used for this purpose; children rated category items in terms of personal preferences rather than as a function of how representative they considered the items to be of their superordinate category. On the basis of these findings, the authors propose an alternative method based on the family resemblance scores of the category members to derive typicality ratings from young children.

Sensory properties of verbally depicted items, such as those of color or shape, were indexed for dominance (frequency of output) and typicality (perceptual goodness). 193 college students were each assigned to 1 of 4 conditions. The most dominant property response was computed for 105 nouns by 1 group. A 2nd group rated these properties for typicality, relative to a constituent property (i.e., given one's idea of yellow, how typically ""yellow"" were specific items?). A 3rd group produced as many properties as possible for each of 65 nouns. Dominance was computed for all 459 properties so produced. The 4th group rated these 459 properties for typicality relative to the parent noun. A multimethod-multitrait analysis indicated that both typicality and dominance were reliable and that both exhibited convergent and discriminant validity. Typicality measured relative to an ideal property exhibited greater discriminant validity from dominance than when measured relative to the parent noun.

NA,"extensions of the paivio yuille and madigan 1968 norms","372 CLARK AND PAIVIO Shoben, 1983), and as theoretical critics questioned the proposed nature of imagery (e.g., Pylyshyn, 1973). Research on item attributes continues to become more sophisticated in a variety of ways, including considera-tion of larger numbers of properties (e.g., Paivio et al., 1989; Rubin, 1980), and serious efforts to model and simulate the effects of stimulus attributes (e.g., Ellis {\&} Lambon Ralph, 2000). Computers have played a central role in both of these developments. The multivariate and simulation studies that might ultimately contribute to the emergence of theoretical models with strong empirical foundations has increased demand for large item pools and increased numbers of properties. The need for a greater number of properties and items follows from the essentially nonexperimental nature of item attribute research. Although researchers may exper-imentally assign different types of materials to different subjects, they generally do not and in some cases cannot experimentally manipulate the property or properties of interest (although such experimental approaches have been used in some cases). Rather, the properties are gen-erally measured in some fashion, and these measures will invariably correlate with other properties that might produce spurious effects or mask the effects of the target attributes. The primary way to address this problem, as in any nonexperimental research, is to identify diverse potentially contaminating constructs, obtain reliable and valid measures, and either control them in the selection of materials or include them in statistical analyses that can accommodate correlated factors (e.g., multiple re-gression, factor analysis, structural equation modeling). In addition to serving this control function, the col-lection of a large number of properties can itself provide information useful in the conceptualization of various item attributes. We can illustrate with one controversial question—the relative importance of frequency and age of acquisition in picture naming and other semantic re-trieval tasks (Morrison {\&} Ellis, 2000). Paivio et al. (1989) obtained picture naming and imagery latencies for a moderate-sized pool of pictures and their most common labels. Information on a wide range of properties, in-cluding age of acquisition, was also obtained. Factor analysis of the results indicated that age of acquisition loaded on several different factors (e.g., familiarity, con-creteness, name length), all of which contributed to pic-ture naming latencies. One interpretation of this result is that age of acquisition is a multidimensional measure that taps a number of distinct properties of words and pictures, hence its superiority to single-component pre-dictors in multiple regression analyses. More specula-tively, one might hypothesize that people rating age of acquisition are actually making judgments of how con-crete, short, and familiar items are, and that children in fact first learn words that tend to be concrete, short, and familiar. Generalization across items provides yet another rea-son to continue the development of item norms for use in cognitive research and theorizing. No single set of norms will ever suffice, because results can depend on the par-ticular pool of items that have been included in the norms. Despite the large corpus of materials on which the Ku{\v{c}}era and Francis (1967) frequency norms are based, for exam-ple, abstract words are still probably overrepresented just because of the types of text that dominate the corpus (e.g., literary and academic materials). It is therefore im-portant to continue to develop additional norms to per-mit evaluation of the generality of findings across di-verse word pools. Another facet of the generalization issue is the possi-bility of generational or cohort differences across ex-tended periods of time. With respect to word familiarity, for example, exposure to and knowledge of particular words might differ today from ratings, like those in the PYM norms, collected during the 1960s. New norms and replication of existing properties allow researchers to de-termine the continuing validity of norms collected years and in some cases decades ago. This article reports two extensions of the PYM norms. Part 1 reports a marked expansion of the number of prop-erties available for the original 925 PYM items, and Part 2 reports an expansion of the number of items for which basic properties are available.

It is argued that the proposed model: (a) is parsimonious in that it utilizes a relatively small number of parameters, (b) is psychologically more meaningful compared with other approaches in that it is attempting to study underlying processes rather than just reveal a similarity structure, (c) yields predictions that have a high level of fit with the observed data. Possible implications from the use of the model for future research are briefly discussed.","Perception {\&} Psychophysics",1981,"Yes","recognit model alphanumer charact method studi recognit similar alphanumer charact briefli discuss evalu applic choic model luce recognit letter critic featur analyt model recognit alphanumer charact base tverski featur similar propos test argu propos model parsimoni util small number paramet psycholog meaning compar approach attempt studi under process reveal similar structur yield predict high level fit observ data implic model futur research briefli discuss",1

Seventy-three sentence contexts (35 low- and 38 high-constraint sentence stems) were presented to 90 children and 102 adolescents. Participants were asked to complete the sentence contexts with the first word that came to mind. For each sentence context, responses were listed and cloze probabilities of the words that were chosen to complete the sentence context were computed. Additionally, idiosyncratic and invalid responses (structural and semantic errors) were analyzed. A high degree of consistency in responses among the two age samples (children and adolescents) was found, along with a decrease of idiosyncratic and invalid responses in older participants. These results shed light on age-related changes in the effects of linguistic context on word production, and also in knowledge's representation.

Word frequencies are provided for four levels: first grade (G1), second grade (G2), third to fifth grades (G3-5), and all grades (G1-5). The frequencies were computed following the methods described by Carroll, Davies, and Richman (1971) and Zeno, Ivenz, Millard, and Duvvuri (1995), with four statistics at each level (F, overall word frequency; D, index of dispersion across the selected readers; U, estimated frequency per million words; and SFI, standard frequency index). The database also provides the number of letters in the word and syntactic category information. MANULEX is intended to be a useful tool for studying language development through the selection of stimuli based on precise frequency norms.

Pictures refined from the original Nishimoto, Miyawaki, Ueda, Une, and Takahashi (Behavior Research Methods 37:398-416, 2005) set were used. Naming behaviors were measured using four imagery-related measures (imageability, vividness, image agreement, and image variability) and four conventional measures (naming time, name agreement, familiarity, and age of acquisition), as well as a number of other measures (17 total). A simultaneous multiple regression analysis performed on naming times showed that the most reliable predictor was H, a measure of name diversity; two image-related measures (image agreement and vividness) and age of acquisition also contributed substantially to the prediction of naming times. The accuracy of picture naming (measured as name agreement) was predicted by vividness, age of acquisition, familiarity, and image agreement. This suggests that certain processes involving mental imagery play a role in picture naming.

The set consists of 98 pairs of droodles. Experiment 1 standardized these pictorial stimuli with respect to several variables, such as appropriateness of verbal labels, relationship between two droodles, and correct recall. Appropriateness of verbal labels was rated higher for pictures presented in pairs than for pictures presented singly. Experiment 2 used the standardized set of droodles in a recall experiment similar to those of Bower, Karlin, and Dueck (1975) and others.

The high correlation between the norm values in the two emotional dimensions of valence and arousal suggests an interlingual homogeneity of emotional representations and allows a significant metanorm-EMONORM-to be established with 6,383 terms characterized in valence and 4,345 terms characterized in arousal. This metanorm is a resource for creating experimental materials in studies on language and emotions. Furthermore, we perform three tests using EMONORM, with the objectives of (1) identifying basic emotions from their valence and arousal values, (2) determining the orientation of texts referring to positive and negative emotions, and (3) evaluating the intensity of emotions expressed in texts.

Yet questions remain as to what types of research can be reproduced, and where differences arise when they cannot be. The present article examines the effect of research location (laboratory vs. online) on normative data collection tasks. Specifically, participants were randomly assigned to a laboratory or online condition and were asked to rate 593 photorealistic images on the basis of object familiarity (N=103) and object visual complexity (N=98). Dependent measures were compared across location conditions, including response latencies and image rating agreement. Our results suggest that norming data collected online are reliable, but an interesting interplay between task type and research location was observed. Specifically, we found that participating online (i.e., a more familiar environment) leads to systematically higher familiarity ratings than in the lab (i.e., an unfamiliar environment). These differences are not found when the alternate complexity rating task is used.","Behavior Research Methods",2009,"Yes","web base imag norm object familiar visual complex rate compar collect lab versus onlin demonstr previous experiment paradigm web base research reliabl replic lab base result question remain type research reproduc differ aris present articl examin effect research locat laboratori onlin normat data collect task specif particip random assign laboratori onlin condit ask rate photorealist imag basi object familiar object visual complex depend measur compar locat condit includ respons latenc imag rate agreement result suggest norm data collect onlin reliabl interest interplay task type research locat observ specif found particip onlin familiar environ lead systemat higher familiar rate lab unfamiliar environ differ found altern complex rate task",1
NA,"new algorithms assessing short summaries in expository texts using latent semantic analysis","In this study, we compared four expert graders with latent semantic analysis (LSA) to assess short summaries of an expository text. As is well known, there are technical difficulties for LSA to establish a good semantic representation when analyzing short texts. In order to improve the reliability of LSA relative to human graders, we analyzed three new algorithms by two holistic methods used in previous research (Le{\'{o}}n, Olmos, Escudero, Ca{\~{n}}as, {\&} Salmer{\'{o}}n, 2006). The three new algorithms were (1) the semantic common network algorithm, an adaptation of an algorithm proposed by W. Kintsch (2001, 2002) with respect to LSA as a dynamic model of semantic representation; (2) a best-dimension reduction measure of the latent semantic space, selecting those dimensions that best contribute to improving the LSA assessment of summaries (Hu, Cai, Wiemer-Hastings, Graesser, {\&} McNamara, 2007); and (3) the Euclidean distance measure, used by Rehder et al. (1998), which incorporates at the same time vector length and the cosine measures. A total of 192 Spanish middle-grade students and 6 experts took part in this study. They read an expository text and produced a short summary. Results showed significantly higher reliability of LSA as a computerized assessment tool for expository text when it used a best-dimension algorithm rather than a standard LSA algorithm.

One area that has shown particular progress is the study of child language development. Although it is now easy to lexically tag every word in a spoken language corpus, one still has to choose between numerous ambiguous forms, especially with languages such as French or English, where more than 70{\%} of words are ambiguous. Computational linguistics can now provide a fully automatic disambiguation of lexical tags. The tool presented here (POST) can tag and disambiguate a large text in a few seconds. This tool complements systems dealing with language transcription and suggests further theoretical developments in the assessment of the status of morphosyntax in spoken language corpora. The program currently works for French and English, but it can be easily adapted for use with other languages.

Imageability is a widely studied lexical variable believed to influence semantic and memory processes (see, e.g., Paivio, 1971). In addition, imageability influences basic word recognition processes (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, {\&} Patterson, 1996). In fact, neuroimaging studies have suggested that reading high- and low-imageable words elicits distinct neural activation patterns for the two types e.g., Bedny {\&} Thompson-Schill (Brain and Language 98:127-139, 2006; Graves, Binder, Desai, Conant, {\&} Seidenberg NeuroImage 53:638-646, 2010). Despite the usefulness of this variable, imageability estimates have not been available for large sets of words. Furthermore, recent megastudies of word processing e.g., Balota et al. (Behavior Research Methods 39:445-459, 2007) have expanded the number of words that interested researchers can select according to other lexical characteristics (e.g., average naming latencies, lexical decision times, etc.). However, the dearth of imageability estimates (as well as those of other lexical characteristics) limits the items that researchers can include in their experiments. Thus, these imageability estimates for disyllabic words expand the number of words available for investigations of word processing, which should be useful for researchers interested in the influences of imageability both as an input and as an outcome variable.","Behavior Research Methods",2012,"Yes","age acquisitiondisyllabicsemant locusword recognit age acquisit estim disyllab word provid imag estim disyllab word supplementari materi download articl wwwspringerlink imag wide studi lexic variabl believ influenc semant memori process paivio addit imag influenc basic word recognit process plaut mcclelland seidenberg patterson fact neuroimag studi suggest read high low imag word elicit distinct neural activ pattern type bedni thompson schill brain languag grave binder desai conant seidenberg neuroimag use variabl imag estim larg set word recent megastudi word process balota al behavior research method expand number word interest research select lexic characterist averag name latenc lexic decis time dearth imag estim lexic characterist limit item research includ experi imag estim disyllab word expand number word investig word process research interest influenc imag input outcom variabl",1

In addition to classical word information such as gender, number, and grammatical category, Lexique includes a series of interesting new characteristics. First, word frequencies are based on two cues: a contemporary corpus of texts and the number of Web pages containing the word. Second, the database is split into a graphemic table with all the relevant frequencies, a table structured around lemmas (particularly interesting for the study of the inflectional family), and a table about surface frequency cues. Third, Lexique is distributed under a GNU-like license, allowing people to contribute to it. Finally, a metasearch engine, Open Lexique, has been developed so that new databases can be added very easily to the existing ones.

Motivated by this background, we provide a set of norms for the axis and direction of motion implied in 299 English verbs, collected from approximately 100 native speakers of British English. Until now, there have been no freely available norms of this kind for a large set of verbs that can be used in any area of language research investigating the semantic representation of motion.

In spite of their importance, there are few collections of faces for use in research, none of which adequately represent the different ages of faces across the lifespan. This lack of a range of ages has limited the majority of researchers to using predominantly young faces as stimuli even when their hypotheses concern both young and old participants. We describe a database of 575 individual faces ranging from ages 18 to 93. Our database was developed to be more representative of age groups across the lifespan, with a special emphasis on recruiting older adults. The resulting database has faces of 218 adults age 18-29, 76 adults age 30-49, 123 adults age 50-69, and 158 adults age 70 and older.

Results indicate a significant relationship between the total number of paragraphs and a variety of linguistic characteristics known to affect student essay scores. These linguistic characteristics (e.g., semantic overlap, syntactic complexity) contribute to two underlying factors (i.e., textual cohesion and difficulty) that are used as dependent variables in mixed-effect models. Results suggest that student essays with 5-8 paragraphs tend to be more linguistically consistent than student essays with 3, 4, and 9 paragraphs. Essays with totals of 5-8 paragraphs, considered by many educators to contain an optimal number of paragraphs, may include functionally and structurally similar paragraphs. These findings could aid writing researchers and educators in obtaining a clearer view of the relationship between the total number of paragraphs comprising an essay and the linguistic characteristics that affect essay evaluation. Consequently, writing interventions may become better equipped to pinpoint student difficulties and facilitate student writing skills by providing more detailed and informed feedback.","Behavior Research Methods",2011,"Yes","coh metrixcohesionessay evaluationnlptext difficultywrit abil bit middl import comput analysi linguist featur bodi paragraph studi examin relationship linguist characterist bodi paragraph student essay total number paragraph essay result signific relationship total number paragraph varieti linguist characterist affect student essay score linguist characterist semant overlap syntact complex contribut under factor textual cohes difficulti depend variabl mix effect model result suggest student essay paragraph tend linguist consist student essay paragraph essay total paragraph consid educ optim number paragraph includ function structur similar paragraph find aid write research educ obtain clearer view relationship total number paragraph compris essay linguist characterist affect essay evalu write intervent equip pinpoint student difficulti facilit student write skill provid detail inform feedback",1
NA,"cvc syllables for investigating the phonetic sensitivity of mandarin and english speakers","Although many individual speech contrasts pairs have been studied within the cross-language literature, no one has created a comprehensive and systematic set of such stimuli. This article justifies and details an extensive set of contrast pairs for Mandarin Chinese and American English. The stimuli consist of 180 pairs of CVC syllables recorded in two tokens each (720 syllables total). Between each CVC pair, two of the segments are identical, whereas the third differs in that a segment drawn from a ""native"" phonetic category (either Mandarin, English, or both) is partnered with a segment drawn from a ""foreign"" phonetic category (nonnative to Mandarin, English, or both). Each contrast pair differs by a minimal phonetic amount and constitutes a meaningful contrast among the world's languages (as cataloged in the UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database of 451 languages). The entire collection of phonetic differences envelops Mandarin and English phonetic spaces and generates a range of phonetic discriminability. Contrastive segments are balanced through all possible syllable positions, with noncontrastive segments being filled in with other ""foreign"" segments. Although intended to measure phonetic perceptual sensitivity among adult speakers of the two languages, these stimuli are offered here to all for similar or for altogether unrelated investigations.","Behavior Research Methods",2008,"Yes","cvc syllabl investig phonet sensit mandarin english speaker individu speech contrast pair studi cross languag literatur creat comprehens systemat set stimuli articl justifi detail extens set contrast pair mandarin chines american english stimuli consist pair cvc syllabl record token syllabl total cvc pair segment ident differ segment drawn nativ phonet categori mandarin english partner segment drawn foreign phonet categori nonnat mandarin english contrast pair differ minim phonet amount constitut meaning contrast world languag catalog ucla phonolog segment inventori databas languag entir collect phonet differ envelop mandarin english phonet space generat rang phonet discrimin contrast segment balanc syllabl posit noncontrast segment fill foreign segment intend measur phonet perceptu sensit adult speaker languag stimuli offer similar altogeth unrel investig",1

Imageability is a widely studied lexical variable believed to influence semantic and memory processes (see, e.g., Paivio, 1971). In addition, imageability influences basic word recognition processes (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, {\&} Patterson, 1996). In fact, neuroimaging studies have suggested that reading high- and low-imageable words elicits distinct neural activation patterns for the two types e.g., Bedny {\&} Thompson-Schill (Brain and Language 98:127-139, 2006; Graves, Binder, Desai, Conant, {\&} Seidenberg NeuroImage 53:638-646, 2010). Despite the usefulness of this variable, imageability estimates have not been available for large sets of words. Furthermore, recent megastudies of word processing e.g., Balota et al. (Behavior Research Methods 39:445-459, 2007) have expanded the number of words that interested researchers can select according to other lexical characteristics (e.g., average naming latencies, lexical decision times, etc.). However, the dearth of imageability estimates (as well as those of other lexical characteristics) limits the items that researchers can include in their experiments. Thus, these imageability estimates for disyllabic words expand the number of words available for investigations of word processing, which should be useful for researchers interested in the influences of imageability both as an input and as an outcome variable.","Behavior research methods",2011,"Yes","battigconcretenessdisyllab wordsimag memori wordment pictur word elicit processingref easili refer construct imageabilitytogliaword imag estim disyllab word provid imag estim disyllab word supplementari materi download articl wwwspringerlink imag wide studi lexic variabl believ influenc semant memori process paivio addit imag influenc basic word recognit process plaut mcclelland seidenberg patterson fact neuroimag studi suggest read high low imag word elicit distinct neural activ pattern type bedni thompson schill brain languag grave binder desai conant seidenberg neuroimag use variabl imag estim larg set word recent megastudi word process balota al behavior research method expand number word interest research select lexic characterist averag name latenc lexic decis time dearth imag estim lexic characterist limit item research includ experi imag estim disyllab word expand number word investig word process research interest influenc imag input outcom variabl",1

NA,"norms for two types of manipulability graspability and functional usage familiarity and age of acquisition for 320 photographs of objects","There is increasing interest in the role that manipulability plays in processing objects. To date, Magni{\'{e}}, Besson, Poncet, and Dolisi's (2003) manipulability ratings, based on the degree to which objects can be uniquely pantomimed, have been the reference point for many studies. However, these ratings do not fully capture some relevant dimensions of manipulability, including whether an object is graspable and the extent to which functional motor associations above and beyond graspability are present. To address this, we collected ratings of these dimensions, in addition to ratings of familiarity and age of acquisition (AoA), for a set of 320 black-and-white photographs of objects. Familiarity and AoA ratings were highly correlated with previously reported ratings of the same dimensions (r = .853, p {\textless} .001, and r = .771, p {\textless} .001, respectively), validating the present norms. Grasping and functional use ratings, in contrast, were more moderately correlated with Magni{\'{e}} et al.'s pantomime manipulability ratings (r = .507, p {\textless} .001).

According to the derived model, topic sentences are identified in the context of the paragraph and in terms of how well each sentence in the paragraph captures the paragraph's theme. In contrast, according to the free model, topic sentences can be identified on the basis of sentential features without reference to other sentences in the paragraph (i.e., without context). The results of the experiments suggest that human raters can identify topic sentences both with and without the context of the other sentences in the paragraph. Another goal of this study was to develop computational measures that approximated each of these models. When computational versions were assessed, the results for the free model were promising; however, the derived model results were poor.

Paraphrasing can be used to aid comprehension, stimulate prior knowledge, and assist in writing-skills development. As such, paraphrasing is a feature of fields as diverse as discourse psychology, composition, and computer science. Although automated paraphrase assessment is both commonplace and useful, research has centered solely on artificial, edited paraphrases and has used only binary dimensions (i.e., is or is not a paraphrase). In this study, we use an extensive database (N = 1,998) of natural paraphrases generated by high school students that have been assessed along 10 dimensions (e.g., semantic completeness, lexical similarity, syntactical similarity). This study investigates the components of paraphrase quality emerging from these dimensions and examines whether computational approaches can simulate those human evaluations. The results suggest that semantic and syntactic evaluations are the primary components of paraphrase quality, and that computationally light systems such as latent semantic analysis (semantics) and minimal edit distances (syntax) present promising approaches to simulating human evaluations of paraphrases.

It is therefore important to understand the processes involved in icon comprehension and the stimulus cues that individuals utilize to facilitate identification. In this study, we examined predictors of icon identification as participants gained experience with icons over a series of learning trials. A dynamic pattern of findings emerged in which the primary predictors of identification changed as learning progressed. In early learning trials, semantic distance (the closeness of the relationship between icon and function) was the best predictor of performance, accounting for up to 55{\%} of the variance observed, whereas familiarity with the function was more important in later trials. Other stimulus characteristics, such as our familiarity with the graphic in the icon and its concreteness, were also found to be important for icon design.

AoA ratings were collected on a 7 point scale, generally following Gilhooly and Logie (1980) procedure with an 8 extra point for ""don't know the word"" answers. Results were analyzed considering AoA ratings and their standard deviations and considering the relationship between AoA ratings and other psycholinguistic variables (imageability, familiarity, written word frequency, concreteness, number of syllables and number of words).

In Experiment 1, four objects in each picture were rated by 48 observers on a 6-point Likert scale for their relevance to the overall meaning of the scene. In Experiment 2, Salience Toolbox software (Walther {\&} Koch, 2006) provided additional information about whether the four relevance-rated objects were located in areas that were high or low in visual salience. Brief descriptions of the four objects, their locations in the picture, their categorizations as high or low in salience, the means and standard deviations of their relevance ratings, and statistical analyses specifying which pairs of objects in a picture differed significantly on their relevance to the meaning of the scene are given in the Appendix.

For each of 519 words that are known by children 18-30 months of age (taken from Caselli {\&} Casadio's, 1995, Italian version of the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory), new values of imageability are provided and values for age of acquisition, child written frequency, and adult written and spoken frequency are included. In this article, correlations among the variables are discussed and the words are grouped into grammatical categories. The results show that words acquired early have imageable referents, are frequently used in the texts read and written by elementary school children, and are frequent in adult written and spoken language. Nouns are acquired earlier and are more imageable than both verbs and adjectives.

Multilevel modeling is commonly utilized to model variability arising from the nesting of lower level observations within higher level units (e.g., students within schools, repeated measures within individuals). However, multilevel models can also be used when two random factors are crossed at the same level, rather than nested. The current work illustrates the use of the multilevel model for crossed random effects within the context of a psycholinguistic experimental study, in which both subjects and items are modeled as random effects within the same analysis, thus avoiding some of the problems plaguing current approaches.","Behavior Research Methods",2007,"Yes","multilevel model altern item analysi psycholinguist research multilevel model present altern separ item subject anova f f psycholinguist research multilevel model common util model variabl aris nest lower level observ higher level unit student school repeat measur individu multilevel model random factor cross level nest current work illustr multilevel model cross random effect context psycholinguist experiment studi subject item model random effect analysi avoid problem plagu current approach",1

A comparison with previous norms showed that noun concepts are more multimodal than adjective concepts, as nouns tend to subsume multiple adjectival property concepts (e.g., perceptual experience of the concept baby involves auditory, haptic, olfactory, and visual properties, and hence leads to multimodal perceptual strength). To show the value of these norms, we then used them to test a prediction of the sound symbolism hypothesis: Analysis revealed a systematic relationship between strength of perceptual experience in the referent concept and surface word form, such that distinctive perceptual experience tends to attract distinctive lexical labels. In other words, modality-specific norms of perceptual strength are useful for exploring not just the nature of grounded concepts, but also the nature of form-meaning relationships. These norms will be of benefit to those interested in the representational nature of concepts, the roles of perceptual information in word processing and in grounded cognition more generally, and the relationship between form and meaning in language development and evolution.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"Yes","auditoryconceptsgustatoryhapticnormsnounsolfactoryperceptu modalitiessound symbolismvisu modal exclus norm noun relationship perceptu experi surfac word form present modal exclus norm random select noun concept particip provid perceptu strength rate sensori modal hear tast touch smell vision comparison previous norm show noun concept multimod adject concept noun tend subsum multipl adjectiv properti concept perceptu experi concept babi involv auditori haptic olfactori visual properti lead multimod perceptu strength show norm test predict sound symbol hypothesi analysi reveal systemat relationship strength perceptu experi refer concept surfac word form distinct perceptu experi attract distinct lexic label word modal specif norm perceptu strength explor natur ground concept natur form mean relationship norm benefit interest represent natur concept role perceptu inform word process ground cognit general relationship form mean languag develop evolut",1

The present study examined how implied perceptual information about typical and atypical colors is represented during language comprehension. Participants read sentences that implied a (typical or atypical) color for a target object and then performed a modified Stroop task in which they named the ink color of the target word (typical, atypical, or unrelated). Results showed that color naming was facilitated both when ink color was typical for that object (e.g., bear in brown ink) and when it matched the color implied by the previous sentence (e.g., bear in white ink following Joe was excited to see a bear at the North Pole). These findings suggest that unusual contexts cause people to represent in parallel both typical and scenario-specific perceptual information, and these types of information are discussed in relation to the specialization of perceptual simulations.","Psychonomic Bulletin and Review",2009,"Yes","bear white wood parallel represent impli object color languag comprehens color undeni import object represent abil context alter color object present studi examin impli perceptu inform typic atyp color repres languag comprehens particip read sentenc impli typic atyp color target object perform modifi stroop task name ink color target word typic atyp unrel result show color name facilit ink color typic object bear brown ink match color impli previous sentenc bear white ink joe excit bear north pole find suggest unusu context peopl repres parallel typic scenario specif perceptu inform type inform discuss relat special perceptu simul",1

Researchers have devised several methods for representing the phonology of words, but these methods are often either unable to represent realistically sized lexicons or inadequate in the ways they represent individual words. In this paper, we present a new phonological pattern generator (PatPho) that allows connectionist modelers to derive accurate phonological representations of the English lexicon.

These norms were developed to provide researchers with photographic slides that varied in emotional evocation, especially arousal and valence. In addition to collecting rating data on the dimensions of arousal and valence, we collected data on the dimensions of consequentiality, meaningfulness, familiarity, distinctiveness, and memorability. Furthermore, we collected ratings on the primary emotions of happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear. A total of 1,302 participants were tested in small groups. The participants in each group rated a subset of 18 slides on 14 dimensions. Ratings were obtained on 703 slides. The means and standard deviations for all of the ratings are provided. We found our valence ratings to be similar to the previous norms. In contrast, our participants were more likely to rate the slides as less arousing than in the previous norms. The mean ratings on the remaining 12 dimensions were all below the midpoint of the 9-point Likert scale. However, sufficient variability in ratings across the slides indicates that selecting slides on the basis of these variables is feasible.

To ensure that the experimental effects obtained from such studies reflect the hypothesised semantic distinction, potential confounds such as psycholinguistic and/or lexical properties of the exact stimuli chosen need to be addressed. In the current study, normative data of such properties were obtained for a series of 875 French adjectives by asking 8 groups of 20 participants to each rate all words on one dimension of theoretical interest.

The present study examines this issue in a society with increased exposure to subtitle reading. We compiled SUBTLEX-GR, a subtitled-based corpus consisting of more than 27 million Modern Greek words, and tested to what extent subtitle-based frequency estimates and those taken from a written corpus of Modern Greek account for the lexical decision performance of young Greek adults who are exposed to subtitle reading on a daily basis. Results showed that SUBTLEX-GR frequency estimates effectively accounted for participants' reading performance in two different visual word recognition experiments. More importantly, different analyses showed that frequencies estimated from a subtitle corpus explained the obtained results significantly better than traditional frequencies derived from written corpora.","Frontiers in Psychology",2010,"Yes","subtitl base word frequenc estim read behavior case greek previous evid shown word frequenc calcul corpora base film televis subtitl readili account read perform languag subtitl great approxim everyday languag present studi examin issu societi increas exposur subtitl read compil subtlex gr subtitl base corpus consist million modern greek word test extent subtitl base frequenc estim written corpus modern greek account lexic decis perform young greek adult expos subtitl read daili basi result show subtlex gr frequenc estim effect account particip read perform visual word recognit experi import analys show frequenc estim subtitl corpus explain obtain result signific tradit frequenc deriv written corpora",1

Five audio stories with sad, joyful, frightening, erotic, or neutral content were presented to 60 participants (33 women, 27 men) in a within-subjects design, each for about 10 min. Participants were asked (1) to report their moods before and after listening to each story, (2) to assess the emotional content of the excerpts on various emotional scales, and (3) to rate their level of projection into the stories. The results confirmed our a priori emotional classification. The emotional stories were effective in inducing the desired mood, with no difference found between male and female participants. These stories therefore constitute a valuable corpus for inducing moods in French-speaking participants, and they are made freely available for use in scientific research.","Behavior Research Methods",2014,"Yes","brussel mood induct audio stori mia databas studi aim valid tool induc mood experiment context audio stori sad joy frighten erot neutral content present particip women men subject design min particip ask report mood listen stori assess emot content excerpt emot scale rate level project stori result confirm priori emot classif emot stori effect induc desir mood differ found male femal particip stori constitut valuabl corpus induc mood french speak particip made freeli scientif research",1

NA,"cross linguistic similarity norms for japaneseenglish translation equivalents","Formal and semantic overlap across languages plays an important role in bilingual language processing systems. In the present study, Japanese (first language; L1)–English (second language; L2) bilinguals rated 193 Japanese–English word pairs, including cognates and noncognates, in terms of phonological and semantic similarity. We show that the degree of cross-linguistic overlap varies, such that words can be more or less “cognate,” in terms of their phonological and semantic overlap. Bilinguals also translated these words in both directions (L1–L2 and L2–L1), providing a measure of translation equivalency. Notably, we reveal for the first time that Japanese–English cognates are “special,” in the sense that they are usually translated using one English term (e.g., コール /kooru/ is always translated as “call”), but the English word is translated into a greater variety of Japanese words. This difference in translation equivalency likely extends to other nonetymologically related, different-script languages in which cognates are all loanwords (e.g., Korean–English). Norming data were also collected for L1 age of acquisition, L1 concreteness, and L2 familiarity, because such information had been unavailable for the item set. Additional information on L1/L2 word frequency, L1/L2 number of senses, and L1/L2 word length and number of syllables is also provided. Finally, correlations and characteristics of the cognate and noncognate items are detailed, so as to provide a complete overview of the lexical and semantic characteristics of the stimuli. This creates a comprehensive bilingual data set for these different-script languages and should be of use in bilingual word recognition and spoken language research.","Behavior Research Methods",2014,"Yes","cross linguist similar norm japaneseenglish translat equival formal semant overlap languag play import role bilingu languag process system present studi japanes languag l english languag l bilingu rate japanes english word pair includ cognat noncogn term phonolog semant similar show degre cross linguist overlap vari word cognat term phonolog semant overlap bilingu translat word direct l l l l provid measur translat equival notabl reveal time japanes english cognat special sens translat english term kooru translat call english word translat greater varieti japanes word differ translat equival extend nonetymolog relat script languag cognat loanword korean english norm data collect l age acquisit l concret l familiar inform unavail item set addit inform ll word frequenc ll number sens ll word length number syllabl provid final correl characterist cognat noncogn item detail provid complet overview lexic semant characterist stimuli creat comprehens bilingu data set script languag bilingu word recognit spoken languag research",1

We obtained a typical quadratic relation between valence and arousal, in line with previous findings. We also tested the reliability of the present ANEW adaptation for Italian by comparing it to previous affective databases and performing split-half correlations for each variable. We found high split-half correlations within our sample and high correlations between our ratings and those of previous studies, confirming the validity of the adaptation of ANEW for Italian.

Thus, measuring the extent to which changes in the structure of an icon will alter its perceived complexity can be costly and slow. An automated system capable of producing reliable estimates of perceived complexity could reduce development costs and time. Measures of icon complexity developed by Garcia, Badre, and Stasko (1994) and McDougall, Curry, and de Bruijn (1999) were correlated with six icon properties measured using Matlab (MathWorks, 2001) software, which uses image-processing techniques to measure icon properties. The six icon properties measured were icon foreground, the number of objects in an icon, the number of holes in those objects, and two calculations of icon edges and homogeneity in icon structure.

NA,"subtlex ch chinese word and character frequencies based on film subtitles","Background Word frequency is the most important variable in language research. However, despite the growing interest in the Chinese language, there are only a few sources of word frequency measures available to researchers, and the quality is less than what researchers in other languages are used to. Methodology Following recent work by New, Brysbaert, and colleagues in English, French and Dutch, we assembled a database of word and character frequencies based on a corpus of film and television subtitles (46.8 million characters, 33.5 million words). In line with what has been found in the other languages, the new word and character frequencies explain significantly more of the variance in Chinese word naming and lexical decision performance than measures based on written texts. Conclusions Our results confirm that word frequencies based on subtitles are a good estimate of daily language exposure and capture much of the variance in word processing efficiency. In addition, our database is the first to include information about the contextual diversity of the words and to provide good frequency estimates for multi-character words and the different syntactic roles in which the words are used.

Word frequency measures should be based on a corpus of at least 20 million words that contains language participants in psychology experiments are likely to have been exposed to.

When we apply these criteria to the word frequency measures available for the German language, we find that the commonly used Celex frequencies are the least powerful to predict lexical decision times. Better results are obtained with the Leipzig frequencies, the dlexDB frequencies, and the Google Books 2000–2009 frequencies.

The IADS-2 is a standardized database of 167 naturally occurring sounds that is widely used in the study of emotions. The sounds were rated by 300 college students who were native speakers of EP, in the three affective dimensions of valence, arousal, and dominance, by using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM). The aims of this adaptation were threefold: (1) to provide researchers with standardized and normatively rated affective sounds to be used with an EP population; (2) to investigate sex and cultural differences in the ratings of affective dimensions of auditory stimuli between EP and the American (Bradley {\&} Lang, 2007a) and Spanish (Fern{\'{a}}ndez-Abascal et al., Psicothema 20:104-113 2008; Redondo, Fraga, Padr{\'{o}}n, {\&} Pi{\~{n}}eiro, Behavior Research Methods 40:784-790 2008) standardizations; and (3) to promote research on auditory affective processing in Portugal.

Q2Stress includes multiple cues readers may use in assigning stress, such as type and token frequency of stress patterns as well as their distribution with respect to number of syllables, grammatical category, word beginnings, word endings, and consonant-vowel structures. Furthermore, for the first time, data for both adults and children are available. Q2Stress may help researchers to answer empirical as well as theoretical questions about stress assignment and stress-related issues, and more in general, to explore the orthography-to-phonology relation in reading.

"Embodiment,Mental simulation,Modality exclusivity,Olfaction,Space","dutch modality exclusivity norms simulating perceptual modality in space","Perceptual information is important for the meaning of nouns. We present modality exclusivity norms for 485 Dutch nouns rated on visual, auditory, haptic, gustatory, and olfactory associations. We found these nouns are highly multimodal. They were rated most dominant in vision, and least in olfaction. A factor analysis identified two main dimensions: one loaded strongly on olfaction and gustation (reflecting joint involvement in flavor), and a second loaded strongly on vision and touch (reflecting joint involvement in manipulable objects). In a second study, we validated the ratings with similarity judgments. As expected, words from the same dominant modality were rated more similar than words from different dominant modalities; but – more importantly – this effect was enhanced when word pairs had high modality strength ratings. We further demonstrated the utility of our ratings by investigating whether perceptual modalities are differentially experienced in space, in a third study. Nouns were categorized into their dominant modality and used in a lexical decision experiment where the spatial position of words was either in proximal or distal space. We found words dominant in olfaction were processed faster in proximal than distal space compared to the other modalities, suggesting olfactory information is mentally simulated as “close” to the body. Finally, we collected ratings of emotion (valence, dominance, and arousal) to assess its role in perceptual space simulation, but the valence did not explain the data. So, words are processed differently depending on their perceptual associations, and strength of association is captured by modality exclusivity ratings.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","embodimentment simulationmod exclusivityolfactionspac dutch modal exclus norm simul perceptu modal space perceptu inform import mean noun present modal exclus norm dutch noun rate visual auditori haptic gustatori olfactori associ found noun high multimod rate domin vision olfact factor analysi identifi main dimens load strong olfact gustat reflect joint involv flavor load strong vision touch reflect joint involv manipul object studi valid rate similar judgment expect word domin modal rate similar word domin modal import effect enhanc word pair high modal strength rate demonstr util rate investig perceptu modal differenti experienc space studi noun categor domin modal lexic decis experi spatial posit word proxim distal space found word domin olfact process faster proxim distal space compar modal suggest olfactori inform mental simul close bodi final collect rate emot valenc domin arous assess role perceptu space simul valenc explain data word process differ depend perceptu associ strength associ captur modal exclus rate",1

NA,"valence arousal familiarity concreteness and imageability ratings for 292 two character chinese nouns in cantonese speakers in hong kong","Words are frequently used as stimuli in cognitive psychology experiments, for example, in recognition memory studies. In these experiments, it is often desirable to control for the words' psycholinguistic properties because differences in such properties across experi-mental conditions might introduce undesirable confounds. In order to avoid confounds, stud-ies typically check to see if various affective and lexico-semantic properties are matched across experimental conditions, and so databases that contain values for these properties are needed. While word ratings for these variables exist in English and other European lan-guages, ratings for Chinese words are not comprehensive. In particular, while ratings for sin-gle characters exist, ratings for two-character words—which often have different meanings than their constituent characters, are scarce. In this study, ratings for 292 two-character Chi-nese nouns were obtained from Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong. Affective variables, including valence and arousal, and lexico-semantic variables, including familiarity, concrete-ness, and imageability, were rated in the study. The words were selected from a film subtitle database containing word frequency information that could be extracted and listed along-side the resulting ratings. Overall, the subjective ratings showed good reliability across all rated dimensions, as well as good reliability within and between the different groups of par-ticipants who each rated a subset of the words. Moreover, several well-established relation-ships between the variables found consistently in other languages were also observed in this study, demonstrating that the ratings are valid. The resulting word database can be used in studies where control for the above psycholinguistic variables is critical to the research design.

NA,"the mpi emotional body expressions database for narrative scenarios","Emotion expression in human-human interaction takes place via various types of information, including body motion. Research on the perceptual-cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of natural emotional body language can benefit greatly from datasets of natural emotional body expressions that facilitate stimulus manipulation and analysis. The existing databases have so far focused on few emotion categories which display predominantly prototypical, exaggerated emotion expressions. Moreover, many of these databases consist of video recordings which limit the ability to manipulate and analyse the physical properties of these stimuli. We present a new database consisting of a large set (over 1400) of natural emotional body expressions typical of monologues. To achieve close-to-natural emotional body expressions, amateur actors were narrating coherent stories while their body movements were recorded with motion capture technology. The resulting 3-dimensional motion data recorded at a high frame rate (120 frames per second) provides fine-grained information about body movements and allows the manipulation of movement on a body joint basis. For each expression it gives the positions and orientations in space of 23 body joints for every frame. We report the results of physical motion properties analysis and of an emotion categorisation study. The reactions of observers from the emotion categorisation study are included in the database. Moreover, we recorded the intended emotion expression for each motion sequence from the actor to allow for investigations regarding the link between intended and perceived emotions. The motion sequences along with the accompanying information are made available in a searchable MPI Emotional Body Expression Database. We hope that this database will enable researchers to study expression and perception of naturally occurring emotional body expressions in greater depth.","PLoS ONE",2014,"Yes","mpi emot bodi express databas narrat scenario emot express human human interact take place type inform includ bodi motion research perceptu cognit mechan under process natur emot bodi languag benefit great dataset natur emot bodi express facilit stimulus manipul analysi exist databas focus emot categori display predomin prototyp exagger emot express databas consist video record limit abil manipul analys physic properti stimuli present databas consist larg set natur emot bodi express typic monologu achiev close natur emot bodi express amateur actor narrat coher stori bodi movement record motion captur technolog result dimension motion data record high frame rate frame fine grain inform bodi movement manipul movement bodi joint basi express posit orient space bodi joint frame report result physic motion properti analysi emot categoris studi reaction observ emot categoris studi includ databas record intend emot express motion sequenc actor investig link intend perceiv emot motion sequenc accompani inform made searchabl mpi emot bodi express databas hope databas enabl research studi express percept natur occur emot bodi express greater depth",1

"Arousal,Conjugated verbs,Emotion,Valence","norms of valence and arousal for 14031 spanish words","Most current models of research on emotion recognize valence (how pleasant a stimulus is) and arousal (the level of activation or intensity that a stimulus elicits) as important components in the classification of affective experiences (Barrett, 1998; Kuppens, Tuerlinckx, Russell, {\&} Barrett, 2012). Here we present a set of norms for valence and arousal for a very large set of Spanish words, including items from a variety of frequencies, semantic categories, and parts of speech, including a subset of conjugated verbs. In this regard, we found that there were significant but very small differences between the ratings for conjugations of the same verb, validating the practice of applying the ratings for infinitives to all derived forms of the verb.

The database includes indices relative to stems (total baseline completion, priming baseline completion, priming, number of completions, ratio between given and deleted letters, and syllabic structure), and indices relative to characteristics of the words used to obtain the stems (frequency, familiarity, number of meanings, length, number of syllables, arousal, and valence). A WSC task was performed by 515 participants to calculate priming and baseline indices. An Exploratory Factor Analysis showed that these indices are grouped in four factors: perceptual, lexical, emotional, and response competition. Stepwise regression analyses performed with these factors showed that the lexical, response competition, and perceptual factors predict priming baseline completion, while only the lexical factor predicts priming.

Chinese-English bilinguals (N=28) were asked to provide the first Chinese translation that came to mind for 1429 English words. The results revealed that 71{\%} of the English words received more than one correct translation indicating the large amount of translation ambiguity when translating from English to Chinese. The relationship between translation ambiguity and word frequency, concreteness and language proficiency was investigated. Although the significant correlations were not strong, results revealed that English word frequency was positively correlated with the number of alternative translations, whereas English word concreteness was negatively correlated with the number of translations. Importantly, regression analyses showed that the number of Chinese translations was predicted by word frequency and concreteness. Furthermore, an interaction between these predictors revealed that the number of translations was more affected by word frequency for more concrete words than for less concrete words. In addition, mixed-effects modelling showed that word frequency, concreteness and English language proficiency were all significant predictors of whether or not a dominant translation was provided. Finally, correlations between the word frequencies of English words and their Chinese dominant translations were higher for translation-unambiguous pairs than for translation-ambiguous pairs. The translation norms are made available in a database together with lexical information about the words, which will be a useful resource for researchers investigating Chinese-English bilingual language processing.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"Yes","chines english bilingualsenglish chines translat normstransl ambigu chines translat norm english word present chines translat norm english word chines english bilingu ask provid chines translat mind english word result reveal english word receiv correct translat indic larg amount translat ambigu translat english chines relationship translat ambigu word frequenc concret languag profici investig signific correl strong result reveal english word frequenc posit correl number altern translat english word concret negat correl number translat import regress analys show number chines translat predict word frequenc concret interact predictor reveal number translat affect word frequenc concret word concret word addit mix effect model show word frequenc concret english languag profici signific predictor domin translat provid final correl word frequenc english word chines domin translat higher translat unambigu pair translat ambigu pair translat norm made databas lexic inform word resourc research investig chines english bilingu languag process",1
NA,"timed picture naming in seven languages","Timed picture naming was compared in seven languages that vary along dimensions known to affect lexical access. Analyses over items focused on factors that determine cross-language universals and cross-language disparities. With regard to universals, number of alternative names had large effects on reaction time within and across languages after target–name agreement was controlled, suggesting inhibitory effects from lexical competitors. For all the languages, word frequency and goodness of depiction had large effects, but objective picture complexity did not. Effects of word structure variables (length, syllable structure, compounding, and initial frication) varied markedly over languages. Strong cross-language correlations were found in naming latencies, frequency, and length. Other-language frequency effects were observed (e.g., Chinese frequencies predicting Spanish reaction times) even after within-language effects were controlled (e.g., Spanish frequencies predicting Spanish reaction times). These surprising cross-language correlations challenge widely held assumptions about the lexical locus of length and frequency effects, suggesting instead that they may (at least in part) reflect familiarity and accessibility at a conceptual level that is shared over languages.","Psychonomic Bulletin {\&} Review",2003,"Yes","time pictur name languag time pictur name compar languag vari dimens affect lexic access analys item focus factor determin cross languag univers cross languag dispar regard univers number altern name larg effect reaction time languag target agreement control suggest inhibitori effect lexic competitor languag word frequenc good depict larg effect object pictur complex effect word structur variabl length syllabl structur compound initi fricat vari mark languag strong cross languag correl found name latenc frequenc length languag frequenc effect observ chines frequenc predict spanish reaction time languag effect control spanish frequenc predict spanish reaction time surpris cross languag correl challeng wide held assumpt lexic locus length frequenc effect suggest part reflect familiar access conceptu level share languag",1

Nevertheless, because the effects of these variables depend on the regularity of the orthographic system, studies must also be done in other languages with different characteristics. The goal of this work was to conduct a lexical decision study in Spanish, a language with a shallow orthography and a high number of words. The influence of psycholinguistic variables on latencies corresponding to 2,765 words was assessed by means of linear mixed-effects modeling. The results show that some variables, such as frequency or age of acquisition, have significant effects on reaction times regardless of the type of words used. Other variables, such as orthographic neighborhood or imageability, were significant only in specific groups of words. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the peculiarities of each spelling system in the development of reading models.","Behavior Research Methods",2014,"Yes","effect psycholinguist variabl lexic decis task spanish studi word order explor role main psycholinguist variabl visual word recognit mega studi conduct english recent year effect variabl depend regular orthograph system studi languag characterist goal work conduct lexic decis studi spanish languag shallow orthographi high number word influenc psycholinguist variabl latenc word assess mean linear mix effect model result show variabl frequenc age acquisit signific effect reaction time type word variabl orthograph neighborhood imag signific specif group word result highlight import take account peculiar spell system develop read model",1
NA,"norms and reading times for acronyms in french","We collected subjective frequency, age-of-acquisition, and imageability norms for 319 acronyms from French adults. Objective printed frequency, bigram frequency, and lengths in letters, phonemes, and syllables, as well as orthographic neighbors, were computed. The time taken to read acronyms aloud was also recorded. Correlational analyses indicated that the relations between the psycholinguistic variables were similar to those usually found for common words (e.g., highly imageable acronyms were more frequent and learned earlier in life than less imageable acronyms), but were generally weaker in the former than in the latter. Linear mixed-model analyses performed on the reading latencies revealed that the main determinants were the voicing feature of initial phonemes, the type of pronunciation of the acronyms (ambiguous vs. unambiguous, typical vs. atypical characteristics), length (number of letters and number of syllables), together with bigram frequency, printed frequency, and imageability. Both objective frequency and imageability interacted reliably with the ambiguous typical and ambiguous atypical properties. Accuracy was predicted by the number of letters and by imageability factors: More errors occurred on longer than on shorter acronyms, and also more errors on less imageable than on more imageable acronyms. The theoretical and methodological implications of the findings for the understanding of acronym reading are discussed.

Twenty-nine actors (19 female) were filmed performing different actions—walking, picking up a box, putting down a box, jumping, sitting down, and standing and acting—while conveying different traits, including four emotions (anger, fear, happiness, sadness), untrustworthiness, and neutral, where no specific trait was conveyed. For the actions conveying the four emotions and untrustworthiness, the actions were filmed multiple times, with the actor conveying the traits with different levels of intensity. In total, we made 2,783 action videos (in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional format), each lasting 7 s with a frame rate of 50 fps. All videos were filmed in a green-screen studio in order to isolate the action information from all contextual detail and to provide a flexible stimulus set for future use. In order to validate the traits conveyed by each action, we asked participants to rate each of the actions corresponding to the trait that the actor portrayed in the two-dimensional videos. To provide a useful database of stimuli of multiple actions conveying multiple traits, each video name contains information on the gender of the actor, the action executed, the trait conveyed, and the rating of its perceived intensity.

In the present paper, a new method for measuring similarity is described, in which subjects rearrange items so that their proximity on a computer screen is proportional to their similarity. This method provides very efficient data collection. If a display hasn objects, then, after subjects have rearranged the objects (requiring slightly more thann movements),n(n-1)/2 pairwise similarities can be recorded. As long as the constraints imposed by two-dimensional space are not too different from those intrinsic to psychological similarity, the technique appears to offer an efficient, user-friendly, and intuitive process for measuring psychological similarity.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, {\&} Computers",1994,"Yes","effici method obtain similar data measur similar typic obtain rate sort perceptu confus task present paper method measur similar subject rearrang item proxim comput screen proport similar method effici data collect display hasn object subject rearrang object requir slight thann movement pairwis similar record long constraint impos dimension space intrins psycholog similar techniqu appear offer effici user friend intuit process measur psycholog similar",1

NA,"imageability and distributional typicality measures of nouns and verbs in contemporary english","Dissociations between noun and verb processing are not uncommon after brain injury; yet, precise psycholinguistic comparisons of nouns and verbs are hampered by the underrepresentation of verbs in published semantic word norms and by the absence of contemporary estimates for part-of-speech usage. We report herein imageability ratings and rating response times (RTs) for 1,197 words previously categorized as pure nouns, pure verbs, or words of balanced noun-verb usage on the basis of the Francis and Kucera (1982) norms. Nouns and verbs differed in rated imageability, and there was a stronger correspondence between imageability rating and RT for nouns than for verbs. For all word types, the image-rating-RT function implied that subjects employed an image generation process to assign ratings. We also report a new measure of noun-verb typicality that used the Hyperspace Analog to Language (HAL; Lund {\&} Burgess, 1996) context vectors (derived from a large sample of Usenet text) to compute the mean context distance between each word and all of the pure nouns and pure verbs. For a subset of the items, the resulting HAL noun-verb difference score was compared with part-of-speech usage in a representative sample of the Usenet corpus. It is concluded that this score can be used to estimate the extent to which a given word occurs in typical noun or verb sentence contexts in informal contemporary English discourse.

The conclusion was that semantic vectors of pointwise mutual information values from very small co-occurrence windows, together with a cosine distance measure, consistently resulted in the best representations across a range of psychologically relevant semantic tasks. This article extends that study by investigating the use of three further factors--namely, the application of stop-lists, word stemming, and dimensionality reduction using singular value decomposition (SVD)--that have been used to provide improved performance elsewhere. It also introduces an additional semantic task and explores the advantages of using a much larger corpus. This leads to the discovery and analysis of improved SVD-based methods for generating semantic representations (that provide new state-of-the-art performance on a standard TOEFL task) and the identification and discussion of problems and misleading results that can arise without a full systematic study.","Behavior Research Methods",2012,"Yes","corpus statisticssvdsemant represent extract semant represent word occurr statist stop list stem svd previous articl present systemat comput studi extract semant represent word word occurr statist larg text corpora conclus semant vector pointwis mutual inform valu small occurr window cosin distanc measur consist result represent rang psycholog relev semant task articl extend studi investig factor applic stop list word stem dimension reduct singular decomposit svd provid improv perform introduc addit semant task explor advantag larger corpus lead discoveri analysi improv svd base method generat semant represent provid state art perform standard toefl task identif discuss problem mislead result aris full systemat studi",1

The attributes obtained in the norming procedure were the shapes' familiarity, describability, associability, availability, and potential for word association. Results from rating data indicate significantly different, yet reliable, responses by participants to the various shape configurations. Multidimensional scaling analysis of shape ratings identified two underlying dimensions of perceived differences: the continuity of a shape's linear direction and the consistency or regularity of its interior angles. By contrast, performance in generating word associations for figures appeared to be linguistically driven, with initial responses related to the similarity of shapes to letters of the alphabet.

"Embodied cognition,Semantic richness,Sensory experience rating,Visual word recognition","sensory experience ratings for over 5000 mono and disyllabic words","Sensory experience ratings (SERs) reflect the extent to which a word evokes a sensory and/or perceptual experience in the mind of the reader.

Here we provide the SERs for the 2,857 monosyllabic words used in the Juhasz et al. study, as well as newly collected ratings on 3,000 disyllabic words.

To facilitate research on a wider variety of tasks, we present norms for 543 words for age-of-acquisition, imagery, familiarity, and meaningfulness. Most of the words form single-solution anagrams. There are 471 six-letter nouns and 72 five-letter words. Also reported are the means, 80s, and ranges for each dimension and the intercorrelations between dimensions. Intergroup reliabilities ranged from .847 to .982. Recent studies have indicated that the age at which words are first learned is influential in determining the ease of retrieving words from semantic memory. Frequency of usage during childhood was found to predict latency to name category instances more accurately than adult frequency of usage (Loftus {\&} Suppes, 1972). Age-of-acquisition as rated by young adults was found by Carroll and White (1973) to be a more relevant variable than objective frequency in predicting latency to name pictures. Rated age -of-acquisition also predicted the speed and likelihood of solving anagrams more accurately than rated familiarity, objective frequency, imagery, and meaningfulness (Stratton, Jacobus, {\&} Brinley, Note l). The norms reported in this paper provide adult norms on rated age-of-acquisition, rated imagery, rated familiarity, and meaningfulness for 543 words.

The overall strategy was to select every 10th word that could be used as a noun. If this was not suitable, the first appropriate word within that group of 10 was selected. It was decided that, for research purposes, a fairly even distribution of words over length by frequency combinations was desirable.

In this article, we report our efforts in developing this instrument, and discuss the data collected from 884 Chinese families in Beijing over a period of 12-30 months, based on our instrument. Chinese children's receptive and expressive lexicons as assessed by our inventory match well with those reported for English on the basis of CDI. In particular, our data indicate comprehension-production differences, individual differences in early comprehension and in later production, and different lexical development profiles among infants versus toddlers. We also make the checklists and norms of our inventory available to the research community via the Internet; they may be accessed from the Psychonomic Society's Archive of Norms, Stimuli, and Data, at www.psychonomic.org/archive.",NA,2008,"Yes","earli vocabulari inventori mandarin chines earli vocabulari develop reliabl predictor children languag skill macarthur bate communic develop inventori cdi provid power tool assess earlyvocabulari develop english languag publish cdi norm mandarin chines import larg scale compar data set understand earli childhood lexicon develop earli vocabulari inventori mandarin articl report effort develop instrument discuss data collect chines famili beij period month base instrument chines children recept express lexicon assess inventori match report english basi cdi data comprehens product differ individu differ earli comprehens product lexic develop profil infant versus toddler make checklist norm inventori research communiti internet access psychonom societi archiv norm stimuli data wwwpsychonomicorgarch",1
"Entropy,Information theory,Semantic association,Text corpus,Word prediction","entropy semantic relatedness and proximity","Although word co-occurrences within a document have been demonstrated to be semantically useful, word interactions over a local range have been largely neglected by psychologists due to practical challenges. Shannon's (Bell Systems Technical Journal, 27, 379–423, 623–665, 1948) conceptualization of information theory suggests that these interactions should be useful for understanding communica- tion. Computational advances make an examination of local word–word interactions possible for a large text corpus. We used Brants and Franz's (2006) dataset to generate conditional probabilities for 62,474 word pairs and entropy calculations for 9,917 words in Nelson, McEvoy, and Schreiber's (Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, {\&} Computers, 36, 402–407, 2004) free association norms. Semantic asso- ciativity correlated moderately with the probabilities and was stronger when the two words were not adjacent. The number of semantic associates for a word and the entropy of a word were also correlated. Finally, language entropy decreases from 11 bits for single words to 6 bits per word for four-word sequences.

NA,"frequency of meaning use for ambiguous and unambiguous words","When using verbal stimuli, researchers usually equate words on frequency of use. However, for some ambiguous words (e.g., ball as a round object or a formal dance), frequency counts fail to distinguish how often a particular meaning is used. This study evaluates the use of ratings to estimate meaning frequency. Analyses show that ratings correlate highly with word frequency counts when orthographic and meaning frequencies should converge, are not unduly influenced by semantic factors, and may provide a better measure of relative meaning dominance than the word association task does. Furthermore, the ratings allow researchers to equate or manipulate frequency of meaning use for ambiguous and unambiguous words.

We have compiled meaning norms for 90 common English words of low, medium, and high concreteness using a methodology designed to correct these weaknesses.

In order to examine the validity of these assumptions, we attempted to measure the O-P and O-S consistencies for 339 kana words and 775 kanji words. Orthographic neighbors were first generated for each of these words. In order to measure the O-P consistencies of the words, their neighbors were then classified as phonological friends or enemies, based on whether the characters shared with the original word were pronounced the same in the two words. In order to measure the O-S consistencies, the similarity in meaning of each of the neighbors to the original word was rated on a 7-point scale. Based on the ratings, the neighbors were classified as semantic friends or enemies. The results indicated that both the O-P consistencies for kanji words and the O-S consistencies for kana words were greater than previously assumed and that the two scripts were actually quite similar on both types of consistency measures.

Frequency, inappropriateness, valence, arousal, and imageability ratings for taboo, emotionally valenced, and emotionally neutral words were made by 78 native-English-speaking college students from a large metropolitan university. The valenced set comprised both positive and negative words, and the emotionally neutral set comprised category-related and category-unrelated words. To account for influences of demand characteristics and personality factors on the ratings, frequency and inappropriateness measures were decomposed into raters' personal reactions to the words versus raters' perceptions of societal reactions to the words (personal use vs. familiarity and offensiveness vs. tabooness, respectively). Although all word sets were rated higher in familiarity and tabooness than in personal use and offensiveness, these differences were most pronounced for the taboo set. In terms of valence, the taboo set was most similar to the negative set, although it yielded higher arousal ratings than did either valenced set. Imageability for the taboo set was comparable to that of both valenced sets. The ratings of each word are presented for all participants as well as for single-sex groups. The inadequacies of the application of normative data to research that uses emotional words and the conceptualization of taboo words as a coherent category are discussed.

Additional results suggested that Internet search engines are an excellent option when traditional word frequency analyses do not contain the necessary data (e.g., estimates for forenames and slang).

Familiarity and learning influence the subjective complexity scores for nonsense shapes, with a significant training x familiarity interaction [F(1,52) = 17.53, p {\textless} .05]. Several image-processing techniques were explored as alternative measures of picture and image complexity. A perimeter detection measure correlates strongly with human judgments of the complexity of line drawings of real-world objects and nonsense shapes and captures some of the processes important in judgments of subjective complexity, while removing the bias due to familiarity effects.","Behavior Research Methods",2008,"Yes","confound pictori set role complex familiar basic level pictur process complex convent defin level detail intricaci contain pictur studi complex receiv attent part absenc accept metric tradit normat rate complex base human judgment studi demonstr publish norm visual complex bias familiar learn influenc subject complex score nonsens shape signific train familiar interact textless imag process techniqu explor altern measur pictur imag complex perimet detect measur correl strong human judgment complex line draw real world object nonsens shape captur process import judgment subject complex remov bias due familiar effect",1
NA,"wordgen a tool for word selection and nonword generation in dutch english german and french","WordGen is an easy-to-use program that uses the CELEX and Lexique lexical databases for word selection and nonword generation in Dutch, English, German, and French. Items can be generated in these four languages, specifying any combination of seven linguistic constraints: number of letters, neighborhood size, frequency, summated position-nonspecific bigram frequency, minimum position-nonspecific bigram f requency, position-specific frequency of the initial and final bigram, and orthographic relatedness. The program also has a module to calculate the respective values of these variables for items that have already been constructed, either with the program or taken from earlier studies. Stimulus queries can be entered through WordGen's graphical user interface or by means of batch files. WordGen is especially useful for (1) Dutch and German item generation, because no such stimulus-selection tool exists for these languages, (2) the generation of nonwords for all four languages, because our program has some important advantages over previous nonword generation approaches, and (3) psycholinguistic experiments on bilingualism, because the possibility of using the same tool for different languages increases the cross-linguistic comparability of the generated item lists.

These models offer a distinct advantage over models that require the collection of a large number of judgments from human subjects, since the construction of the representations can be completely automated. Unfortunately, word frequency, a well-known predictor of reaction time in several cognitive tasks, has a strong effect on the co-occurrence counts in a corpus. Two words with high frequency are more likely to occur together purely by chance than are two words that occur very infrequently.

NA,"usage frequencies of complement taking verbs in spanish and english data from spanish monolinguals and spanish english bilinguals","Verb bias, or the tendency of a verb to appear with a certain type of complement, has been employed in psycholinguistic literature as a tool to test competing models of sentence processing. To date, the vast majority of sentence processing research involving verb bias has been conducted almost exclusively with monolingual speakers, and predominantly with monolingual English speakers, despite the fact that most of the world's population is bilingual. To test the generality of competing theories of sentence comprehension, it is important to conduct cross-linguistic studies of sentence processing and to add bilingual data to theories of sentence comprehension. Given this, it is critical for the field to develop verb bias estimates from monolingual speakers of languages other than English and from bilingual populations. We begin to address these issues in two norming studies. Study 1 provides verb bias norming data for 135 Spanish verbs. A second aim of Study 1 was to determine whether verb bias estimates remain stable over time. In Study 2, we asked whether Spanish-English speakers are able to learn verb-specific information, such as verb bias, in their second language. The answer to this question is critical to conducting studies that examine when, during the course of sentence comprehension, bilingual speakers exploit verb information specific to the second language. To facilitate cross-linguistic work, we compared our verb bias results with those provided by monolingual English speakers in a previous norming study conducted by Garnsey, Lotocky, Pearlmutter, and Myers (1997). Our Spanish data demonstrated that individual verbs showed significant similarities in their verb bias across the 3 years of data collection. We also show that bilinguals are able to learn the biases of verbs in their second language, even when immersed in the first language environment.

NA,"grounding co occurrence identifying features in a lexical co occurrence model of semantic memory","Lexical co-occurrence models of semantic memory represent word meaning by vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors are derived from word usage, as found in a large corpus of written text. Typically, these models are fully automated, an advantage over models that represent semantics that are based on human judgments (e.g., feature-based models). A common criticism of co-occurrence models is that the representations are not grounded: Concepts exist only relative to each other in the space produced by the model. It has been claimed that feature-based models offer an advantage in this regard. In this article, we take a step toward grounding a cooccurrence model. A feed-forward neural network is trained using back propagation to provide a mapping from co-occurrence vectors to feature norms collected from subjects. We show that this network is able to retrieve the features of a concept from its co-occurrence vector with high accuracy and is able to generalize this ability to produce an appropriate list of features from the co-occurrence vector of a novel concept.","Behavior Research Methods",2009,"Yes","ground occurr identifi featur lexic occurr model semant memori lexic occurr model semant memori repres word mean vector high dimension space vector deriv word usag found larg corpus written text typic model fulli autom advantag model repres semant base human judgment featur base model common critic occurr model represent ground concept exist relat space produc model claim featur base model offer advantag regard articl step ground cooccurr model feed forward neural network train back propag provid map occurr vector featur norm collect subject show network retriev featur concept occurr vector high accuraci general abil produc list featur occurr vector concept",1

"Information sources, Semantic relatedness, Lexical database, Databases, Semantics, Websites","a novel technique for detecting plagiarism in documents exploiting information sources","Plagiarism takes place when we use any person’s work without giving due acknowledgment. There are several fields where the text similarity is involved like web document retrieval, information mining, and searching related articles. Several approaches have been introduced for detecting plagiarism in the text documents based on the syntactic structure of the text, string similarity, fingerprinting, semantic meaning underlying the text, etc. The basic limitation of plagiarism detection systems these days is that they fail to detect tough cases of plagiarism. The proposed plagiarism detection approach is the hybrid of semantic and syntactic similarity between the text documents. This novel approach exploits linguistic information sources non-linearly using the lexical database for finding the relatedness between text documents. The proposed approach uses semantic knowledge to perform cognitive-inspired computing. The framework is capable of detecting intelligent plagiarism cases like a verbatim copy, paraphrasing, rewording in a sentence, and sentence transformation. The approach has been evaluated on the standard PAN-PC-11 dataset. The experiments show that our technique has outperformed other strong baseline techniques in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and plagiarism detection (PlagDet) score.

"language, sign language, lexicon, word forms, Language, Sign Language, Word Recognition, Mental Lexicon","language deprivation and the american sign language lexicon","Our understanding of the mental lexicon, the way meaning is extracted from word forms, is almost entirely built on data from spoken languages. While there is much work demonstrating that in many ways the linguistic structure and psychological mechanisms for processing signed language and spoken language processing are the same, less is known about the signed language mental lexicon. In this dissertation, I examine the structure of the American Sign Language mental lexicon, and the ways meaning can be extracted from the manual/visual signal. In the third chapter of this dissertation I ask whether a single cognitive architecture might explain diverse behavioral patterns in signed and spoken language. Chen and Mirman (2012) presented a computational model of word processing that unified opposite effects of neighborhood density in speech production, perception, and written word recognition. Carreiras et al. (2008) demonstrate that neighborhood density effects in Spanish Sign Language (LSE) also vary depending on whether the neighbors share the same handshape or location. We present a spreading activation architecture that borrows the principles proposed by Chen and Mirman (2012), and show that if this architecture is elaborated to incorporate relatively minor facts about either 1) the time course of sign perception or 2) the frequency of sub-lexical units in sign languages, it produces data that match the experimental findings from sign languages. This work serves as a proof of concept that a single cognitive architecture could underlie both sign and word recognition. In the second chapter I present ASL-LEX, a lexical database for ASL that catalogues more than forty properties about almost 1,000 signs. The database includes, for example, information about each sign's iconicity, phonological make-up, and neighborhood density. I use this information to better understand the structure of the ASL lexicon, the distribution of each of these properties, and the relationships between these properties. This lexical database is the largest and most comprehensive database of ASL, and can be used by researchers to develop experiments and by educators to identify and support vocabulary development. In the fourth chapter, I use ASL-LEX to develop a tightly-controlled study of sign perception. I ask whether neighborhood density and sub-lexical frequency play a role in sign perception, and if the mechanisms of sign perception are affected by early language experience. Eighty deaf participants with varying early language backgrounds completed a lexical decision task. I find that neighborhood density inhibits sign perception in people with low early ASL exposure, but has no effect in people with high early ASL exposure.

"sign language, phonological similarity, lexical access, Lexical Access, Sign Language, Phonological Awareness","operationalization of sign language phonological similarity and its effects on lexical access","Cognitive mechanisms for sign language lexical access are fairly unknown. This study investigated whether phonological similarity facilitates lexical retrieval in sign languages using measures from a new lexical database for American Sign Language. Additionally, it aimed to determine which similarity metric best fits the present data in order to inform theories of how phonological similarity is constructed within the lexicon and to aid in the operationalization of phonological similarity in sign language. Sign repetition latencies and accuracy were obtained when native signers were asked to reproduce a sign displayed on a computer screen. Results indicated that, as predicted, phonological similarity facilitated repetition latencies and accuracy as long as there were no strict constraints on the type of sublexical features that overlapped. The data converged to suggest that one similarity measure, MaxD, defined as the overlap of any 4 sublexical features, likely best represents mechanisms of phonological similarity in the mental lexicon. Together, these data suggest that lexical access in sign language is facilitated by phonologically similar lexical representations in memory and the optimal operationalization is defined as liberal constraints on overlap of 4 out of 5 sublexical features—similar to the majority of extant definitions in the literature.

By developing an intelligent tutoring system, this dissertation examines whether automatically providing enriched sense-specific information is effective for vocabulary learning and reading comprehension of second language learners. The system developed in this study contributes to an extended understanding of how NLP techniques can be applied more effectively in an educational environment. The system allows learners to upload texts and click on any content word in order to obtain sense-appropriate lexical information for unfamiliar or unknown words during reading. The system consists of three components: (1) the system manager controls the interaction among each learner, the NLP server, and the lexical database; (2) the NLP server converts a raw input text to a linguistically-analyzed text; (3) the lexical database is used to provide a sense-appropriate definition and example sentences of a word to the learner. To obtain the sense-appropriate information, the system first performs word sense disambiguation (WSD) on the input text. Pointing to appropriate examples tuned for language learners, however, is complicated by the fact that the database of examples is from one repository (COBUILD), while automatic WSD systems generally rely on senses from another (WordNet). The lexical database, then, is indexed by WordNet senses, each of which points to an appropriate corresponding COBUILD sense. The fact that every sense inventory has its own standards of sense distinction poses a serious problem in integrating these inventories into one. To redirect an input WordNet sense to a corresponding COBUILD sense, thus, a word sense alignment algorithm was developed, following a heuristic of favoring flatter alignment structures. With this system, an empirical study was conducted with 60 intermediate learners of English as a second language to examine whether this system can lead learners to improve their vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension. The findings show that learners demonstrated higher performance when receiving sense-specific information. Furthermore, the qualitative examination of the effect of automatic system errors show that, although learners showed learning regardless of the appropriateness of lexical information, they still showed relatively greater learning when given appropriate lexical information.

Age of acquisition is compared to a measure of lexical development based on vocabulary size rather than age, and robust regression models are used to assess the individual and joint effects of word class, frequency, imageability and phonological neighbourhood density on Norwegian children’s early lexical development. The Norwegian Communicative Development Inventories (CDI) norms were used to calculate each CDI word’s age of acquisition and vocabulary size of acquisition. Lexical properties were downloaded from the lexical database Norwegian Words, supplemented with data on frequency in adult and child-directed speech. Age of acquisition correlated highly with vocabulary size of acquisition, but the new measure was more evenly distributed and more sensitive to lexical effects. Frequency in child-directed speech was the most important predictor of lexical development, followed by imageability, which seems to account for the dominance of nominals over predicates in Norwegian.

This database was used as the basis for the development of the PolyLex lexicons, which included syntactic, morphological and phonological information for around 3,000 words of Dutch, English and German. Orthographic information was subsequently added in the PolyOrth project. The PolyOrth project was based on the assumption that the underlying, lexical phonological forms could be used to derive the surface orthographic forms by means of a combination of phoneme-grapheme mappings and sets of autonomous spelling rules for each language. One of the complications encountered during the project was the fact that the phonological forms in CELEX were not always genuinely underlying forms which made deriving the orthographic forms tricky. This paper discusses the nature and status of underlying phonological forms, their relation to orthography and the issues of finding this information in databases.

Evidence from timing experiments, association norms, and distributional properties of words supported a semantic network model in which words are interlinked via a small number of lexical and conceptual relations. Its large coverage and unique structure, which allows automatic systems to detect and quantify semantic relatedness among words, soon made WordNet an invaluable tool for natural language processing tasks. Information retrieval, document summarization, and machine translation crucially require word sense discrimination and disambiguation. Wordnets have been built in dozens of languages and for specific technical sublanguages, and the number of applications in research, language technology and pedagogy has grown.

This question is pursued by using a large lexical database to establish systematic correlations between spelling, phonology and morphology. The main insights are: Consonant doubling is most regular at morpheme boundaries. It can be described in graphemic terms alone, i.e. without reference to phonology. In monomorphemic words, consonant doubling depends mostly on the word ending. Certain endings correlate with double consonants (e.g. <er> as in <summer>), while others correlate with single consonants (e.g. <it> as in <visit>). What is more, it is the graphemic form of the word ending that determines the presence or absence of double consonants: The word endings <-ic> and <-ick>, for example, are homophonous, but the former almost always occurs with single consonants (e.g. <panic>), the latter with double consonants (e.g. <derrick>). That makes graphemic word endings peculiar entities: Like suffixes, they are recurring and they have distributional properties—but unlike suffixes, they have no morphosyntactic or semantic function.

Empirical mutual intelligibility measures were obtained from functional intelligibility tests at the sentence level from 15 listeners for each of 15 Chinese dialects. We computed various proximity measures on the basis of shared phonemes and tones in the sound inventories of the 15 dialects. Next, Levenshtein (string-edit) distance measures were computed on the 764 common syllabic units (zi in Pinyin, i.e., a meaningful character or morpheme with a complete transcription of segments and tone) shared by the same 15 Chinese dialects in the Dialect Sound Database of Modern Chinese (compiled by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences). Unweighted and perceptually weighted Levenshtein distance measures were computed. We also included objective similarity measures of phonological correspondence, based on the Zihui character list and of lexical affinity, based on the Cihui cross-dialect lexical database with all cognate and non-cognate expressions of 905 core concepts) that have been published by Cheng (1997). The best single predictor of mutual intelligibility between a pair of dialects was the percentage of cognates shared between them (r² = .548). Including all predictors afforded a highly accurate prediction of mutual intelligibility (R² = .874). A very reasonable prediction is afforded if we just add the lexical frequency of finals (syllable rhymes) shared by a pair of dialects (R² = .611).

However, computers still have problems understanding natural languages, especially the Chinese language, firstly because the Chinese language has no space to segment lexical entries (its segmentation method is more difficult than that of English) and secondly because of the lack of a complete grammar in the Chinese language, making parsing more difficult and complicated. Building an automated Chinese feedback system for special application domains could solve these problems. This paper proposes an interactive feedback mechanism in a virtual campus that can parse, understand and respond to Chinese sentences. This mechanism utilizes a specific lexical database according to the particular application. In this way, a virtual campus website can implement a special application domain that chooses the proper response in a user friendly, accurate and timely manner.

French is an interesting case because it differs from most other writing systems in that it uses a large number of multi-letter vowel graphemes and consonants that are systematically silent (i.e., do not map to any lexical phonology; e.g., trop ). Here, we developed a French version of the Connectionist Dual Process Model of Reading Aloud (CDP++) that can handle multisyllabic stimuli (up to three syllables) and has a large-scale lexicon of more than 100,000 words. We tested the model on extant data and an additional experiment examining the reading aloud of nonwords with potentially silent letters. The results from the extant data showed that the model was able to capture a number of important psycholinguistic effects in the literature and explained between 52% and 67% of the item-specific variance in two large databases. The results of the silent-letter experiment showed that, contrary to what would be predicted on the basis of lexical database statistics, people generally pronounce 'silent' consonants in nonwords. We show that the French CDP++ model faithfully predicted this effect because it implements a linear mapping between orthography and phonology. These findings highlight the theoretical and practical significance of using computational models to help determine the processes and representations that underlie skilled reading.

The technique involved selection of a phonemically transcribed machine-readable lexical database; definition of transcription rules based on measures of phonetic similarity; application of the transcription rules to a lexical database and formation of lexical equivalence classes; and computation of 3 metrics to examine the transcribed lexicon. The metric percent words unique demonstrated that distribution of words in the language preserves lexical uniqueness across a wide range in the number of potentially available phonemic distinctions. Expected class size demonstrated that if at least 12 phonemic equivalence classes were available, any given word would be highly similar to only a few other words. Percent information extracted provided evidence that high-frequency words tend not to reside in the same lexical equivalence classes as other high-frequency words.

Cognitive differences between patients with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment are evident in their performance on the semantic verbal fluency test. In addition to the semantic verbal fluency test score, several other performance characteristics sensitive to disease status and predictive of future cognitive decline have been defined in terms of words generated from semantically related categories (clustering) and shifting between categories (switching). However, the traditional assessment of clustering and switching has been performed manually in a qualitative fashion resulting in subjective scoring with limited reproducibility and scalability. Our approach uses word definitions and hierarchical relations between the words in WordNet®, a large electronic lexical database, to quantify the degree of semantic similarity and relatedness between words. We investigated the novel semantic fluency indices of mean cumulative similarity and relatedness between all pairs of words regardless of their order, and mean sequential similarity and relatedness between pairs of adjacent words in a sample of patients with clinically diagnosed probable (n = 55) or possible (n = 27) Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment (n = 31). The semantic fluency indices differed significantly between the diagnostic groups, and were strongly associated with neuropsychological tests of executive function, as well as the rate of global cognitive decline. Our results suggest that word meanings and relations between words shared across individuals and computationally modeled via WordNet and large text corpora provide the necessary context to account for the variability in language-based behavior and relate it to cognitive dysfunction observed in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.

"structural approach, automatic adjudication, word sense disagreements, semantic annotation, text structure, computational lexicon, Connotations, Lexical Access, Semantics, Text Structure, Word Meaning, Adjudication","a structural approach to the automatic adjudication of word sense disagreements","The semantic annotation of texts with senses from a computational lexicon is a complex and often subjective task. As a matter of fact, the fine granularity of the WordNet sense inventory [Fellbaum, Christiane (ed.). 1998. WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database MIT Press], a de facto standard within the research community, is one of the main causes of a low inter-tagger agreement ranging between 70% and 80% and the disappointing performance of automated fine-grained disambiguation systems (around 65% state of the art in the Senseval-3 English all-words task). In order to improve the performance of both manual and automated sense taggers, either we change the sense inventory (e.g. adopting a new dictionary or clustering WordNet senses) or we aim at resolving the disagreements between annotators by dealing with the fineness of sense distinctions. The former approach is not viable in the short term, as wide-coverage resources are not publicly available and no large-scale reliable clustering of WordNet senses has been released to date. The latter approach requires the ability to distinguish between subtle or misleading sense distinctions. In this paper, we propose the use of structural semantic interconnections—a specific kind of lexical chains—for the adjudication of disagreed sense assignments to words in context. The approach relies on the exploitation of the lexicon structure as a support to smooth possible divergencies between sense annotators and foster coherent choices. We perform a twofold experimental evaluation of the approach applied to manual annotations from the SemCor corpus, and automatic annotations from the Senseval-3 English all-words competition. Both sets of experiments and results are entirely novel: structural adjudication allows to improve the state-of-the-art performance in all-words disambiguation by 3.3 points (achieving a 68.5% Fl-score) and attains figures around 80% precision and 60% recall in the adjudication of disagreements from human annotators.

They belong to the same category as the words to be remembered, but their prototypic value remains largely unexplored. The prototype is the most representative word in a particular lexical category. The prototypic value is measured according to different criteria: written and oral lexical frequency, frequency of use, degree of typicality, degree of familiarity and rank of quotation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the prototypic value of intrusions produced by 17 Alzheimer's patients with mild to severe dementia, during the cued recall of the Grober & Buschke procedure (RL/RI 16 items). The prototypic value was compared to the categorial norms provided by 1) 17 control subjects and 2) the lexical database 'Lexique 3'. The results show that intrusions had a significantly higher prototypic value than targeted items. The prototypic value increased with the progression of the disease, and according to the evaluation criteria used. Thus with the criteria 'frequency of use', 'degree of typicality' and 'degree of familiarity,' the prototypic value increased exponentially with the severity of dementia. In contrast, in spite of the development of the pathology, the prototypic value decreased when assessed by the criteria of 'rank of quotation', and 'lexical frequency' (oral and written). In conclusion, the qualitative analysis of the prototypic value of intrusion errors in Alzheimers opens up new clinical and methodological considerations.

"content-collaborative recommender, WordNet-based user profiles, neighborhood formation, content-based filtering, Algorithms, Collaboration, Linguistics, Machine Learning, Semantics","a content collaborative recommender that exploits wordnet based user profiles for neighborhood formation","Collaborative and content-based filtering are the recommendation techniques most widely adopted to date. Traditional collaborative approaches compute a similarity value between the current user and each other user by taking into account their rating style, that is the set of ratings given on the same items. Based on the ratings of the most similar users, commonly referred to as neighbors, collaborative algorithms compute recommendations for the current user. The problem with this approach is that the similarity value is only computable if users have common rated items. The main contribution of this work is a possible solution to overcome this limitation. We propose a new content-collaborative hybrid recommender which computes similarities between users relying on their content-based profiles, in which user preferences are stored, instead of comparing their rating styles. In more detail, user profiles are clustered to discover current user neighbors. Content-based user profiles play a key role in the proposed hybrid recommender. Traditional keyword-based approaches to user profiling are unable to capture the semantics of user interests. A distinctive feature of our work is the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles representing user interests in a more effective way, compared to classical keyword-based profiles, due to a sense-based indexing. Semantic profiles are obtained by integrating machine learning algorithms for text categorization, namely a naïve Bayes approach and a relevance feedback method, with a word sense disambiguation strategy based exclusively on the lexical knowledge stored in the WordNet lexical database. Experiments carried out on a content-based extension of the EachMovie dataset show an improvement of the accuracy of sense-based profiles with respect to keyword-based ones, when coping with the task of classifying movies as interesting (or not) for the current user. An experimental session has been also performed in order to evaluate the proposed hybrid recommender system. The results highlight the improvement in the predictive accuracy of collaborative recommendations obtained by selecting like-minded users according to user profiles.

The artificial learners, memory-based learning algorithms, are trained (1) to convert written words to their phonemic counterparts and (2) to analyze written words on their morphological composition, based on data extracted from the CELEX lexical database. As an exception to the competition effect we show that introducing the schwa as a letter in the spelling system causes both morphology and phonology to be learnt better by the artificial learners.

The data confirm the existence of formationally related noun–verb pairs in Auslan in which the verb displays a single movement and the noun displays a repeated movement. The data also suggest that the best exemplars of noun–verb pairs of this type in Auslan form a distinct set of iconic (mimetic) signs archetypically based on inherently reversible actions (such as opening and shutting). This strong iconic link perhaps explains why the derivational process appears to be of limited productivity, though it does appear to have 'spread' to a number of signs that appear to have no such iconicity. There appears to be considerable variability in the use of the derivational markings, particularly in connected discourse, even for signs of the 'open and shut' variety.

Various aspects of pitch movements throughout the words are systematically varied in order to determine what aspects of the pitch contour affect categorization of words on the basis of accent. In addition, this thesis also investigates the effect on categorization of loss of pitch due to lack of voicing in various parts of the word. The model determined by these studies reveals two more-or-less orthogonal perceptual dimensions; pitch alignment with speech segments determines accent location and the amount of pitch drop determines accent presence. This study also investigates how to quantify the distinctive function of pitch accent in a way which incorporates the frequency of the contrasting items, as well as the peculiar category structure of accents. This model was applied in the analysis of a large-scale lexical database, revealing many irregularities in the distribution and use of accents. Comparing this quantification of the lexical use of accent with the perceptual experiments shows that accent-location detection is functionally more fundamental than accent-presence detection in short, 2-mora words.

By comparing the network indicators that are associated with the hierarchical features in language networks, we learn that the hierarchy of Chinese lexical networks has indeed evolved over time at three different levels. The connections of words at the micro level are continually weakening; the number of words in the meso-level communities has increased significantly; and the network is expanding at the macro level. This means that more and more words tend to be connected to medium-central words and form different communities. Meanwhile, fewer high-central words link these communities into a highly efficient small-world network.

It is generally thought that saccades help redirect the retinal fovea to specific characters and words but that actual discrimination of information only occurs during periods of fixation.

Here, using a paradigm where a string of either lexical (Chinese) or non-lexical (alphabetic) characters are triggered by saccadic eye movements, we show that subjects can discriminate both while making saccadic eye movement.

Namely, (a) if two sentences share many features in common, then it is likely that the remaining features in each sentence are also related, and (b) if two sentences contain many related features, then those two sentences are themselves similar. The two constraints are utilized in an iterative bootstrapping procedure that simultaneously updates both word and sentence similarity scores.

Method:  Eleven PD patients performed VF tasks in their STN DBS ON and OFF condition. To differentiate VF-components modulated by the stimulation, a temporal cluster analysis was performed, separating production spurts (i.e., ‘clusters’ as correlates of automatic activation spread within lexical fields) from slower cluster transitions (i.e., ‘switches’ reflecting set-shifting towards new lexical fields).

The data used in this study are diachronic Chinese short narrative texts with a time span of over 2000-years. We show that the increase of word length is an essential regularity in word evolution. On the one hand, word frequency is found to depend on word length, and their relation is in line with the Power law function y = ax-b. On the other hand, our deeper analyses show that the increase of word length results in the simplification in characters for balance in written Chinese.

These range from shallow orthographies with transparent grapheme-phoneme relations, to deep orthographies, in which these relations are opaque.

In these studies a betweenlanguage design was applied, making it difficult to isolate the aspect of orthographic depth. In the present work this question was examined using a within-subject-and-language investigation. The participants were speakers of Hebrew, as they are skilled in reading two forms of script transcribing the same oral language.

Neurophysiological reflection of activation of such memory traces has been reported using the mismatch negativity brain potential (MMN), which demonstrates an enhanced response to meaningful words over meaningless items. This enhancement is believed to be generated by the activation of strongly intraconnected long-term memory circuits for words that can be automatically triggered by spoken linguistic input and that are absent for unfamiliar phonological stimuli. This conceptual framework critically predicts different amounts of activation depending on the strength of the word's lexical representation in the brain.

The task of hedge detection is often divided into two subtasks: detecting uncertain cues and their linguistic scope. Hedge scope is a sequence of tokens including the hedge cue in a sentence. Previous hedge scope detection methods usually take all tokens in a sentence as candidate boundaries, which inevitably generate a large number of negatives for classifiers. The imbalanced instances seriously mislead classifiers and result in lower performance. This paper proposes a dependency-based candidate boundary selection method (DCBS), which selects the most likely tokens as candidate boundaries and removes the exceptional tokens which have less potential to improve the performance based on dependency tree.

In this study we investigated whether semantic processing modes can also affect lexical-semantic activation during word production. Specifically, we tested whether the processing of linguistic ambiguities, presented in the form of puns, has an influence on the co-activation of unrelated meanings of homophones in a subsequent language production task. In a picture-word interference paradigm with word distractors that were semantically related or unrelated to the non-depicted meanings of homophones we found facilitation induced by related words only when participants listened to puns before object naming, but not when they heard jokes with unambiguous linguistic stimuli.

To leverage from it a linguistic constraint, learning algorithms have percolated this constraint from concepts, to word forms: some algorithms rely on the possibility that word forms are associated with convex sets of objects.

Such descriptors are different in each context thereby limiting comparisons, and can also mix facets of meaning such as emotional states, short term tactics and long-term goals. To develop a systematic set of concepts for second-by-second social interactions, we suggest a complementary approach based on practices employed in theater. Theater uses the concept of dramatic action, the effort that one makes to change the psychological state of another.

It supports the important process of transforming unstructured resources into structured knowledge. To date, several CR approaches have been proposed, most of which focus on a particular set of biomedical ontologies.

However, no prior approach considers the case sensitivity characteristics and the term distribution of the underlying ontology on the CR process. This article proposes a framework that models the CR process as an information retrieval task in which both case sensitivity and the information gain associated with tokens in lexical representations (e.g., term labels, synonyms) are central components of a strategy for generating term variants.

Paralinguistic information is conveyed mainly through acoustic features like pitch, rhythm, tempo and so on. These acoustic features are generally known as prosody. It is known that some species of birds can discriminate certain aspects of human speech. However, there have not been any studies on the discrimination of prosody in human language which convey different paralinguistic meanings by birds. In the present study, we have shown that the Java sparrow (Padda oryzivora) can discriminate different prosodic patterns of Japanese sentences. These birds could generalize prosodic discrimination to novel sentences, but could not generalize sentence discrimination to those with novel prosody. Moreover, unlike Japanese speakers, Java sparrows used the first part of the utterance as the discrimination cue.

Methodology: Here we examined how letter position coding is attained in the tactile modality via Braille reading. The idea is that Braille word recognition may provide more serial processing than the visual modality, and this may produce differences in the input coding schemes employed to encode letters in written words. To that end, we conducted a lexical decision experiment with adult Braille readers in which the pseudowords were created by transposing/replacing two letters.

NA,"naming a structured world a cultural route to duality of patterning","The lexicons of human languages organize their units at two distinct levels. At a first combinatorial level, meaningless forms (typically referred to as phonemes) are combined into meaningful units (typically referred to as morphemes). Thanks to this, many morphemes can be obtained by relatively simple combinations of a small number of phonemes. At a second compositional level of the lexicon, morphemes are composed into larger lexical units, the meaning of which is related to the individual meanings of the composing morphemes. This duality of patterning is not a necessity for lexicons and the question remains wide open regarding how a population of individuals is able to bootstrap such a structure and the evolutionary advantages of its emergence.

Participants with slower reaction times in the LDT showed semantic priming (faster reaction times for semantically related compared to unrelated targets) and negative repetition priming (slower reaction times for repeated compared to semantically related targets). This is the first report of semantic priming in the auditory modality without conscious categorization of the prime.

"ARABIC etymology, WORD recognition, VOCABULARY, SIGHT vocabulary, READING cues","evaluating effects of divided hemispheric processing on word recognition in foveal and extrafoveal displays the evidence from arabic","Background: Previous studies have claimed that a precise split at the vertical midline of each fovea causes all words to the left and right of fixation to project to the opposite, contralateral hemisphere, and this division in hemispheric processing has considerable consequences for foveal word recognition. However, research in this area is dominated by the use of stimuli from Latinate languages, which may induce specific effects on performance. Consequently, we report two experiments using stimuli from a fundamentally different, non-Latinate language (Arabic) that offers an alternative way of revealing effects of split-foveal processing, if they exist. Methods and Findings: Words (and pseudowords) were presented to the left or right of fixation, either close to fixation and entirely within foveal vision, or further from fixation and entirely within extrafoveal vision.

This phenomenon is known as the ""attentional blink"" (AB) and is generally attributed to a failure to consolidate information in visual short-term memory due to depleted or disrupted attentional resources. Previous research has shown that items presented during the AB that fail to reach conscious awareness are still processed to relatively high levels, including the level of meaning. For example, missed word stimuli have been shown to prime later targets that are closely associated words.

Symbolic (i.e., semantic neighbourhood distance) and embodied (i.e., iconicity) factors were manipulated in two tasks—one that tapped symbolic relations (i.e., semantic relatedness judgment) and another that tapped embodied relations (i.e., iconicity judgment). Results supported the symbol interdependency hypothesis in that the symbolic factor was recruited for the semantic relatedness task and the embodied factor was recruited for the iconicity task. Across tasks, and especially in the iconicity task, abstract stimuli resulted in shorter RTs. This finding was in contrast to the concreteness effect where concrete words result in shorter RTs.

These impairments have usually been explained by a phonological transmission deficit hypothesis or by an inhibitory deficit hypothesis. This decline can, however, be modulated by the educational level of the sample. This study analyzed the possible role of these approaches in explaining both object and face naming impairments during aging. Older adults with low and high educational level and young adults with high educational level were asked to repeatedly name objects or famous people using the semantic-blocking paradigm.

This may be due to the grouping of tones according to harmonic relationships by recognition mechanisms prior to fine pitch processing. Poorer frequency resolution of auditory information available to recognition mechanisms may lead to unrelated tones being grouped, resulting in underestimation of pitch number. Methods, Results and Conclusion: We tested whether pitch enumeration is better for chords of full harmonic complex tones, where grouping errors are less likely, than for complexes with fewer and less accurately tuned harmonics.

Since humans can distinguish about 240 different pitches over an octave in the mid-range of hearing [1], in principle a very large number of tone combinations could have been used for this purpose. Nonetheless, compositions in Western classical, folk and popular music as well as in many other musical traditions are based on a relatively small number of scales that typically comprise only five to seven tones [2-6]. Why humans employ only a few of the enormous number of possible tone combinations to create music is not known. Here we show that the component intervals of the most widely used scales throughout history and across cultures are those with the greatest overall spectral similarity to a harmonic series.

While the possible forces favoring norm change—such as institutions or committed activists—have been identified for a long time, little is known about how a population adopts a new convention, due to the difficulties of finding representative data. Here, we address this issue by looking at changes that occurred to 2,541 orthographic and lexical norms in English and Spanish through the analysis of a large corpora of books published between the years 1800 and 2008. We detect three markedly distinct patterns in the data, depending on whether the behavioral change results from the action of a formal institution, an informal authority, or a spontaneous process of unregulated evolution. We propose a simple evolutionary model able to capture all of the observed behaviors, and we show that it reproduces quantitatively the empirical data. This work identifies general mechanisms of norm change, and we anticipate that it will be of interest to researchers investigating the cultural evolution of language and, more broadly, human collective behavior.

The aim is to compare the ranges and kinds of these words in parent-child interaction and to consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of early lexical development. Color term data were drawn from the Gleason corpus in CHILDES: 12 boys and 12 girls ranging in age from 25-62 months, and their parents. Results showed that parents used and emphasized only the same 10 most basic colors, with many teaching episodes. Parents’ most frequent terms, red, blue, and green were also children’s most frequent terms and are the ones acquired earliest according to MacArthur Bates lexical norms. In the second study CLAN programs were used to identify animal names in corpora from a variety of families in CHILDES, with 44 children ranging in age from 1;6-6;2. Children and parents produced a remarkable number and range of animal terms, with individual preschoolers naming as many as 96 different, often rare, animals, such as crocodile and pelican. Parents and children thus attend to the same limited set of basic color terms. By contrast, biophilia, our shared human love of the living world is reflected in children’s extensive animal lexicon.

"COMPUTATIONAL linguistics, LEARNING, LIKES & dislikes, REALIZATION (Linguistics), DATA analysis, Research Article","incorporating linguistic knowledge for learning distributed word representations","Combined with neural language models, distributed word representations achieve significant advantages in computational linguistics and text mining. Most existing models estimate distributed word vectors from large-scale data in an unsupervised fashion, which, however, do not take rich linguistic knowledge into consideration. Linguistic knowledge can be represented as either link-based knowledge or preference-based knowledge, and we propose knowledge regularized word representation models (KRWR) to incorporate these prior knowledge for learning distributed word representations. Experiment results demonstrate that our estimated word representation achieves better performance in task of semantic relatedness ranking. This indicates that our methods can efficiently encode both prior knowledge from knowledge bases and statistical knowledge from large-scale text corpora into a unified word representation model, which will benefit many tasks in text mining.

"ANIMAL communication, ANIMAL behavior, LANGUAGE research, NOUNS (Grammar), VERBS, EVOLUTION research","the biological origin of linguistic diversity","In contrast with animal communication systems, diversity is characteristic of almost every aspect of human language. Languages variously employ tones, clicks, or manual signs to signal differences in meaning; some languages lack the noun-verb distinction (e.g., Straits Salish), whereas others have a proliferation of fine-grained syntactic categories (e.g., Tzeltal); and some languages do without morphology (e.g., Mandarin), while others pack a whole sentence into a single word (e.g., Cayuga). A challenge for evolutionary biology is to reconcile the diversity of languages with the high degree of biological uniformity of their speakers. Here, we model processes of language change and geographical dispersion and find a consistent pressure for flexible learning, irrespective of the language being spoken. This pressure arises because flexible learners can best cope with the observed high rates of linguistic change associated with divergent cultural evolution following human migration.

In written language, information is encoded by the concatenation of basic symbols under grammatical and semantic constraints. As is also the case in other natural information carriers, the resulting symbolic sequences show a delicate balance between order and disorder. That balance is determined by the interplay between the diversity of symbols and by their specific ordering in the sequences.

The key finding was that autonomic responses to swear words were larger than to euphemisms and neutral stimuli. It is argued that the heightened response to swear words reflects a form of verbal conditioning in which the phonological form of the word is directly associated with an affective response. Euphemisms are effective because they replace the trigger (the offending word form) by another word form that expresses a similar idea. That is, word forms exert some control on affect and cognition in turn.

Specifically, we examined a Complementary Learning Systems account, which implies that sleep-related consolidation should be more beneficial for new hippocampally dependent arbitrary mappings (e.g. new vocabulary items) relative to new systematic mappings (e.g. grammatical regularities), which can be better encoded neocortically. The hypothesis was tested using a novel language with an artificial grammatical gender system.

The proposed measure has a simple predictive interpretation and can account for various confounding factors through proper conditioning. We revisit some of the previous studies that reported strong signatures of stylistic accommodation, and find that a significant part of the observed coordination can be attributed to a simple confounding effect—length coordination. Specifically, longer utterances tend to be followed by longer responses, which gives rise to spurious correlations in the other stylistic features. We propose a test to distinguish correlations in length due to contextual factors (topic of conversation, user verbosity, etc.) and turn-by-turn coordination. We also suggest a test to identify whether stylistic coordination persists even after accounting for length coordination and contextual factors.

We focus on interethnic meeting potential during free-time, measured as copresence, and its relationship to copresence at place of residence and work.

Recently, probabilistic models of language learning have been applied to this problem, framing it as a statistical inference from a random sample of sentences. These probabilistic models predict that learners should be sensitive to the way in which sentences are sampled. There are two main types of sampling assumptions that can operate in language learning: strong and weak sampling. Strong sampling, as assumed by probabilistic models, assumes the learning input is drawn from a distribution of grammatical samples from the underlying language and aims to learn this distribution.

Using a network approach from bioinformatics, we examined the historical dynamics of morphemes, the fixation of new morphemes and the emergence of words containing existing morphemes. We found that these processes are driven mainly by the number of different direct neighbors of a morpheme in words (connectivity, an equivalent to family size or type frequency) and not its frequency of usage (equivalent to token frequency).

Here we address this question in the framework of the emergence of shared linguistic categories in a population of individuals interacting through language games.

Recently, it has been shown that slow temporal information in speech (i.e., the envelope of speech) is critical for speech comprehension. Furthermore, it has been found that evoked electric potentials in human cortex are correlated with the speech envelope. However, it has been unclear whether this essential linguistic feature is encoded differentially in specific regions, or whether it is represented throughout the auditory system. To answer this question, we recorded neural data with high temporal resolution directly from the cortex while human subjects listened to a spoken story. We found that the gamma activity in human auditory cortex robustly tracks the speech envelope.

"MUSIC physiology, MUSIC & language, MUSICAL accentuation, MUSICAL acoustics & physics, MUSICAL pitch","effects of culture on musical pitch perception","The strong association between music and speech has been supported by recent research focusing on musicians' superior abilities in second language learning and neural encoding of foreign speech sounds. However, evidence for a double association-the influence of linguistic background on music pitch processing and disorders-remains elusive. Because languages differ in their usage of elements (e.g., pitch) that are also essential for music, a unique opportunity for examining such language-to-music associations comes from a cross-cultural (linguistic) comparison of congenital amusia, a neurogenetic disorder affecting the music (pitch and rhythm) processing of about 5% of the Western population. In the present study, two populations (Hong Kong and Canada) were compared. One spoke a tone language in which differences in voice pitch correspond to differences in word meaning (in Hong Kong Cantonese, /si/ means 'teacher' and 'to try' when spoken in a high and mid pitch pattern, respectively). )","PLoS ONE",2012,"No","music physiolog music languag music accentu music acoust physic music pitch effect cultur music pitch percept strong associ music speech support recent research focus musician superior abil languag learn neural encod foreign speech sound evid doubl associ influenc linguist background music pitch process disord remain elus languag differ usag element pitch essenti music uniqu opportun examin languag music associ cross cultur linguist comparison congenit amusia neurogenet disord affect music pitch rhythm process western popul present studi popul hong kong canada compar spoke tone languag differ voic pitch correspond differ word mean hong kong cantones si mean teacher spoken high mid pitch pattern",0
"LANGUAGE & languages, PHRASEOLOGY, LINGUISTICS, NOUNS (Grammar), ADJECTIVES (Grammar), PSYCHOLOGY","phrase frequency effects in language production","A classic debate in the psychology of language concerns the question of the grain-size of the linguistic information that is stored in memory. One view is that only morphologically simple forms are stored (e.g., 'car', 'red'), and that more complex forms of language such as multi-word phrases (e.g., 'red car') are generated on-line from the simple forms. In two experiments we tested this view. In Experiment 1, participants produced noun+adjective and noun+noun phrases that were elicited by experimental displays consisting of colored line drawings and two superimposed line drawings. In Experiment 2, participants produced noun+adjective and determiner+noun+adjective utterances elicited by colored line drawings. In both experiments, naming latencies decreased with increasing frequency of the multi-word phrase, and were unaffected by the frequency of the object name in the utterance.

However, some evidence suggests that duration and pitch are fundamentally interconnected and co-vary in signaling word meaning in non-tonal languages as well.

Results revealed effects of English ability on the recognition of emotions in English speech but not in non-linguistic vocalizations.

The first reason is that the genealogical relationship of the Koreanic to other neighboring languages remains uncertain, and thus inference from the linguistic comparative method provides only provisional evidence. The second reason is that, as the ancestral Koreanic speakers lacked their own writing system until around 500 years ago, there are scant historical materials to peer into the past, except for those preserved in Sinitic characters that we have no straightforward way of interpreting.

Participants viewed a pair of briefly flashed objects and were then tested on either the relative spatial relation or identity of one of those objects. Using eye tracking to reveal participants’ voluntary shifts of attention over time, we found that when initial fixation was on neither object, relational memory showed an absolute advantage for the object following an attention shift, while identity memory showed no advantage for either object.

Numerous studies using computational methods derived from evolutionary biology have been successfully applied to varied subset of linguistic data. One of the major drawback regarding musical studies is the lack of suitable coded musical data that can be analysed using such evolutionary tools. Here we present for the first time an original set of musical data coded in a way that enables construction of trees classically used in evolutionary approaches. Using phylogenetic methods, we test two competing theories on musical evolution: vertical versus horizontal transmission. We show that, contrary to what is currently believed, vertical transmission plays a key role in shaping musical diversity.

Failure to maintain this pattern of stressed-unstressed syllables in American English is one key element that contributes to a “foreign accent” in second language speakers.

Stimuli that require controlled integration of information, such as the quantitative or linguistic information (commonly found in judgment studies), may lead to suboptimal performance.

Attempts to understand how dynamic factors affect the origin and distribution of cultural elements are, therefore, of interest to all humanity. As case studies go, understanding the distribution of cultural elements in Native American communities during the historical period of the Great Plains would seem a most challenging one. Famously, there is a mixture of powerful internal and external factors, creating-for a relatively brief period in time-a seemingly distinctive set of shared elements from a linguistically diverse set of peoples.

It is evident primarily among individuals who started music lessons in early childhood. Because AP requires memory for specific pitches as well as learned associations with verbal labels (i.e., note names), it represents a unique opportunity to study interactions in memory between linguistic and nonlinguistic information. One untested hypothesis is that the pitch of voices may be difficult for AP possessors to identify. A musician's first instrument may also affect performance and extend the sensitive period for acquiring accurate AP. Methods/Principal Findings: A large sample of AP possessors was recruited on-line.

Using event-related potentials in a dual task paradigm, we had previously found that sentence processing takes into consideration task relevant sentence-external semantic but not syntactic information. In that study, internal and external information both varied within the same linguistic domain—either semantic or syntactic. Here we investigated whether across-domain sentence-external information would impact within-sentence processing. Methodology: In one condition, adjectives within visually presented sentences of the structure [Det]-[Noun]-[Adjective]- [Verb] were semantically correct or incorrect.

A significant component of human social communication depends upon interpreting and responding to another person's prosodic tone as well as one's own ability to produce prosodic speech. However there has been little work on whether the perception and production of prosody share common neural processes, and if so, how these might correlate with individual differences in social ability. Methods: The aim of the present study was to determine the degree to which perception and production of prosody rely on shared neural systems.

We examine two language networks based on different Chinese versions of the Records of the Grand Historian. The comparative results show that Zipf’s law holds and that both networks are scale-free and disassortative. The interactivity and connectivity of the two networks lead us to expect that the modern Chinese text would have more phrases than the ancient Chinese one. Furthermore, by considering some of the topological and weighted quantities, we find that expressions in ancient Chinese are briefer than in modern Chinese. These observations indicate that the two languages might have different linguistic mechanisms and combinatorial natures, which we attribute to the stylistic differences and evolution of written Chinese.

To assess and compare how humans and monkeys classified visual stimuli, we trained 7 rhesus macaques and 41 human volunteers to respond, in a specific order, to four simultaneously presented stimuli at a time, each belonging to a different perceptual category.

To date, it has not been determined whether signatures of Greek or Jewish admixture can be detected in the Kashmiri population. Using genome-wide genotyping and admixture detection methods, we determined there are no significant or substantial signs of Greek or Jewish admixture in modern-day Kashmiris.

In this model, linguistic terms represented as triangular fuzzy numbers are used to quantify experts’ uncertain assessments of alternatives with respect to the criteria. The fuzzy set is then integrated into the AHP to determine the weights of the criteria. Finally, a fuzzy ARAS is used to calculate the weights of the alternatives.

In this research, we explore whether sound symbolism may also facilitate synchronic language learning in human infants. Sound symbolism may be a useful cue particularly at the earliest developmental stages of word learning, because it potentially provides a way of bootstrapping word meaning from perceptual information. Using an associative word learning paradigm, we demonstrated that 14-month-old infants could detect Köhler-type (1947) shape-sound symbolism, and could use this sensitivity in their effort to establish a word-referent association.

It showed that the interaction of genre and intentionality level are crucial in determining how narratives are cognitively processed. Specifically, genres that deployed evolutionarily familiar scenarios (relationship stories) were rated as being higher in quality when levels of intentionality were increased; conversely, stories that lacked evolutionary familiarity (espionage stories) were rated as being lower in quality with increases in intentionality level.

Here we show that interactive improvisation between two musicians is characterized by activation of perisylvian language areas linked to processing of syntactic elements in music, including inferior frontal gyrus and posterior superior temporal gyrus, and deactivation of angular gyrus and supramarginal gyrus, brain structures directly implicated in semantic processing of language. These findings support the hypothesis that musical discourse engages language areas of the brain specialized for processing of syntax but in a manner that is not contingent upon semantic processing.

Conversely, the semantic content of the sentence affects the motor potential measured immediately before the upward or downward action is initiated. We propose that this bidirectional link between motor system and language arises because the motor system implements forward models that predict the sensory consequences of actions. Because the same movement (e.g., raising the arm) can have multiple forward models for different contexts, the models can make different predictions depending on whether the arm is raised, for example, to place an object or raised as a threat.

A novel program-based analysis is implemented in order to show certain empirical problems related to these hierarchies.

The empirical issues uncovered cast doubt on classical parametric models of language acquisition as well as on the conceptualization of an overspecified Universal Grammar that has parameters among its primitives. Pinpointing these issues leads to the proposal that (i) the (bio)logical problem of language acquisition does not amount to a process of triggering innately pre-wired values of parameters and (ii) it paves the way for viewing language, epigenetic (‘parametric’) variation as an externalization-related epiphenomenon, whose learning component may be more important than what sometimes is assumed.

Unfortunately, expert judgement is often derived by informal and largely untested protocols, despite evidence that the quality of judgements can be improved with structured approaches.

In the present study, we explored the cognitive effects of employing the hand as articulator. We focused on the arbitrariness of the form-meaning relationship—a fundamental feature of natural languages—and asked whether sign languages change the processing of arbitrary non-linguistic stimulus-response (S-R) associations involving the hand. This was tested using the Simon effect, which specifically requires such type of associations. Differences between signers and speakers (non-signers) only appeared in the Simon task when hand stimuli were shown. Response-time analyses revealed that the distinctiveness of signers’ responses derived from an increased ability to process memory traces of arbitrary S-R pairs related to the hand. These results shed light on the interplay between language and cognition as well as on the effects of sign language acquisition.

We found that adding noise increased the number of fixations to the mouth area, at the price of a decreased number of fixations to the eyes.

We develop a workflow for the analysis of shell forms based on the aperture ontogeny profile, starting from the procedure of data preparation (retopologising the shell model), via data acquisition (calculation of aperture growth trajectory, aperture form and ontogeny axis), and data presentation (qualitative comparison between shell forms) and ending with)","PLoS ONE",2016,"No","biolog seashel prepar data electron data process data acquisit system gastropoda physiolog biolog life scienc comput inform scienc curvatur data acquisit data manag development biolog evolutionari biolog evolutionari process geometri imag techniqu linguist morpholog linguist malacolog mathemat morphogenesi morphometri physic scienc research analysi method research articl social scienc taxonomi zoolog method quantifi visualis analys gastropod shell form quantit analysi organism form import compon branch biolog general consid easili measur structur quantif gastropod shell form challeng shell lack homolog structur spiral form difficult captur linear measur view adopt idea theoret model shell form shell form product apertur ontogeni profil term apertur growth trajectori quantifi curvatur torsion apertur form repres size shape develop workflow analysi shell form base apertur ontogeni profil start procedur data prepar retopologis shell model data acquisit calcul apertur growth trajectori apertur form ontogeni axi data present qualit comparison shell form end",0

Experiment 1 used a priming methodology to examine children's (3–4; 5–6) grammatical restrictions on verbal un- prefixation. To elicit production of un-prefixed verbs, test trials were preceded by a prime sentence, which described reversal actions with grammatical un- prefixed verbs (e.g., Marge folded her arms and then she unfolded them).

Here we address this problem by taking a detailed look at simple past tense verbs in the Corpus of Historical American English. The data show that the language is open, with many new verbs entering. At the same time, existing verbs might tend to regularize or irregularize as a consequence of internal dynamics, but overall, the amount of irregularity sustained by the language stays roughly constant over time.

In Western societies, average to taller stature men and comparatively shorter, slimmer women have higher reproductive success and are typically considered more attractive. This size dimorphism also extends to vocalisations in many species, again including humans, with larger individuals exhibiting lower formant frequencies than smaller individuals. Further, across many languages there are associations between phonemes and the expression of size (e.g. large /a, o/, small /i, e/), consistent with the frequency-size relationship in vocalisations. We suggest that naming preferences are a product of this frequency-size relationship, driving male names to sound larger and female names smaller, through sound symbolism.

Humans can recognize many objects rapidly even in complex scenes, a task that still presents major challenges for computer vision systems. A common experimental demonstration of this ability is the rapid animal detection protocol, where human participants earliest responses to report the presence/absence of animals in natural scenes are observed at 250-270 ms latencies. One of the hypotheses to account for such speed is that people would not actually recognize an animal per se, but rather base their decision on global scene statistics. These global statistics (also referred to as spatial envelope or gist) have been shown to be computationally easy to process and could thus be used as a proxy for coarse object recognition.

Although this effect has been replicated in many domains, there has been little investigation into such effects in medicine in general or patient management in particular. Methodology/Principal Findings: We designed a 10-item forced-choice triad task in which subjects chose which one of two hypothetical patients best matched a target patient. The target and its potential matches were related in terms of surface features (e.g., two patients of a similar age and gender) and deep features (e.g., two diabetic patients with similar management strategies: a patient with arthritis and a blind patient would both have difficulty with self-injected insulin).

In particular, it is unknown whether all rhythm skills are linked together, forming a single broad rhythmic competence, or whether there are multiple dissociable rhythm skills.

This hypothesis was supported by a recent study showing that ventral striatal activity is higher for correct rejections than hits when the value of rejections is increased by external incentives. These findings imply that the striatal response during recognition is context-sensitive and modulated by the adaptive significance of “oldness” or “newness” to the current goals.

Here, we tested two predictions of this model: (1) A plane that is stationary in an earth-fixed reference frame will be perceived as changing its slant if the movement of the observer's head causes a variation of the optic flow; (2) a surface that rotates in an earth-fixed reference frame will be perceived to be stationary, if the surface rotation is appropriately yoked to the head movement so as to generate a variation of the surface slant but not of the optic flow.

However, this assessment often requires comparison in learning performance across different task conditions, which may differ in the relative salience or discriminability of the stimuli associated with more and less rewarding outcomes, respectively. To address this issue, in a first set of studies, participants were subjected to two versions of a common probabilistic learning task. The two versions differed with respect to the stimulus (Hiragana) characters associated with reward probability.

"agentive syntax, cross-linguistic differences, fairness, organizational justice, perception, Spanish, English, Justice, Language, Linguistics, Syntax","the language of fairness how cross linguistic norms in spanish and english influence reactions to unfair treatment","We integrate recent findings from the linguistics literature with the organizational justice literature to examine how the language used to encode justice violations influences fairness perceptions. The study focused on the use of non-agentive syntax to encode mistakes in Spanish ('The vase was broken') versus using agentive syntax in English ('She broke the vase') influences event fairness perceptions. We hypothesized that when justice violations are encoded using Spanish, because the non-agentive syntax makes the responsible party less salient, the event would be perceived as less unfair. In Study 1 (n = 111), English-speaking participants rated the fairness of an event in which a mistake was made and an employee received a negative outcome. They rated it as more unfair (p < .01, η² = .06) when the scenario was presented in agentive syntax. Experiment 2 (n = 70) used native English- and Spanish-speakers who watched a video of manager making a mistake. We found that Spanish-speakers used less agentive syntax (p < .01, η² = .21), perceived the event as less unfair (p < .001, η² = .23), and were more willing to help the manager who made the mistake. In Experiment 3 (n = 101) we replicated this effect controlling for cross-cultural differences and native language; further, we found an interaction between entity fairness (event vs. entity) and native language (Spanish vs. English) on citizenship intentions (p < .01, η² = .08).

Adopting an interactional linguistic framework that is based on ethnomethodological and conversation analytic theoretical thinking, we aim to describe the social and linguistic norms that emerge in so-called ‘morning circles’, a highly ritualised interactional routine that transfers part of the interactional responsibility to the children and at the same time teaches the prerequisites for specific communicative practices. As morning circles are turned into language teaching lessons on a regular basis, we describe the linguistic features that emerge as learning objects, and some of the learning practices in which they are embedded. We will argue that language learning practices are situated practices, connecting the use of linguistic forms with ideologies of linguistic and social appropriateness. Our analysis is based on video recordings of three sessions in a first grade class in a primary school in a medium sized town in Germany, which have been transcribed and qualitatively analysed.

"position of linguistic norms, direction of similarity vs difference comparison asymmetries in relational judgments, college students, Cognitive Processes, Judgment, Language, Stimulus Similarity, Social Norms","direction of comparison asymmetries in relational judgment the role of linguistic norms","The authors documented a linguistic norm account of direction of comparison asymmetry effects in relational judgments (e.g., seeing hyenas as more similar to dogs than dogs are similar to hyenas). The asymmetry effect is magnified by discrepancies in prominence between subject and reference, and has previously been explained using A. Tversky's (1977) feature-matching model. Given a linguistic norm to place more prominent objects in the referent position, violation of this norm might reduce sentence clarity, which then weakens the magnitude of subsequent relational judgments. 53 undergraduates completed a study that tested the degree to which both clarity and feature-matching predicted the magnitude of relational judgments by construction in 3 regression models, on for each of the 3 types of relation statements: similarity, difference, and spatial relation. Clarity perceptions predict the magnitude of relational judgments independently of the cognitive manipulation of the features of the compared objects. The pattern of findings suggests that a linguistic norm interpretation may account for variance in relational judgments independently of Tversky's feature-matching model.

The paper discusses the role of metaphor as a form of creative language and a deviation from more linguistic norms and conventionalities. Two current theories are discussed as providing alternatives to metaphor identification approaches. These are Hanks’ (Int J Lexicogr 17:3, 2004) Theory of Norms and Exploitations and Hoey’s (Lexical priming and the properties of text, 2003) Theory of Lexical Priming. It is proposed that the theory of lexical priming can be adopted to provide an explanation of linguistic norms and exploitations involved in metaphoric language. Finally, the paper provides a brief corpus analysis of the verb to kindle found in a corpus of Nineteenth Century writings.

Sociolinguists have focused on how children socialize each other into vernacular styles appropriate for peer group use but often assume that they disalign with social and linguistic norms for classroom behavior. Drawing from a nine-month ethnographic study that the author conducted in an after-school program, this article analyzes the structure and function of joning as a vernacular style of African American Vernacular English and its uses in constructing classroom identities. Joning often facilitated student learning, but it was perceived as a socially and physically risky linguistic practice because of its uses as conflict talk in the local community. Focusing on preadolescence as a key stage of language socialization, this article shows how minority students modify peer-learned linguistic practices to pursue academic success on their own terms.

This research focuses on the differential use of Spanish and Portuguese in Rivera, the largest city on the border. Using self-reported data and metalinguistic commentaries extracted from interviews with 63 Spanish–Portuguese bilinguals, the use of both languages in various domains (home, school, work spaces) and with diverse interlocutors (family, friends, co-workers, superiors) is analyzed. Quantitative and qualitative analysis reveals that Portuguese, which has been marginalized for decades, is more frequently used in the home with relatives and close friends. The use of Portuguese in more formal domains, including schools, is much less frequent. The results from this study corroborate a perception within the community that Portuguese lacks the prestige of Spanish and provide further evidence of its status as a primarily home language. The current research does not show a progressive shift toward Spanish in Rivera nor does it support claims by other researchers that this community is diglossic.

My theoretical framework draws upon the Arendtian notions of ‘public space’, and ‘action and speech’ as well as Bourdieu’s concepts of ‘symbolic violence’ and ‘habitus’. My methodology is a critical qualitative approach. Fourteen immigrant youth, aged 15–25, were involved in this research. The findings of this study indicate that unlike second-generation immigrants, first-generation immigrant youth face cultural and linguistic challenges. Non-recognition of youths’ distinct linguistic and social capitals, the imposition of official languages and the regulation of the education and language market according to the dominant linguistic norms include forms of discrimination against Turkish minority youth in Canada. Taken together, the findings suggest that immigrant youths’ cultural and linguistic experiences of inclusion and exclusion cannot be dissociated from the wider politics of the nation-state, popular hegemony and social inequalities in the host society.

The report of an empirical study shows that the current LMS design does not provide writing students in general and writing students from periphery cultural and linguistic backgrounds in particular an opportunity of a higher-level interactivity with the LMS. The current design neither includes periphery students' cultural and linguistic norms and values, nor does it allow them to affect the existing design through their design activities. These LMSs are currently constraining users from higher-level interactions. As a result, writing students have to act as the LMS ask them to do, and they remain passive in these platforms. Based on the web usability test responses, this study proposes to invite Citizen Designers, writing students from periphery cultural and linguistic backgrounds, to design LMS interfaces to enhance user activities and transform them into cross-cultural platforms. This study analyzes interface designs by Citizen Designers to see how designers acquire their agency in a cross-cultural digital contact zone.

We examined variables derived from eco-dialogical coding of an episode of World of Warcraft play involving three English learners. According to the Eco-dialogical model (Zheng, 2012), second language (L2) learners need to learn to take skilled linguistic action (Cowley, 2013), a process of realizing the values of physical, sociocultural and dialogical affordances in the environment. We employed Multinomial Logistic Regression to determine which of our variables were predictors for three types of values realizing; namely, wayfinding orienting to sociocultural norms and synergized values realizing of both wayfinding and orientation to sociocultural norms. The model we developed suggested that when communicative projects collectively entailed players’ a) verbalizing with synchronized avatar action, b) attending to game rules and c) coordinating in anticipation of good future prospects, players were more likely to realize both values realizing types synergistically. In other words, players' skilled linguistic action of prospective coordination, combined with multimodal languaging and constrained by WoW game rules, together, were more likely to lead to dual values realizing. This finding suggests that dual values realizing evokes connections between real-time first-order physical movements and multimodal languaging with situation transcending practices (Linell, 2009) which are second-order rules, and other sociocultural and linguistic norms. Coupling this finding with our Eco-dialogical unit of analysis, communicative projects, we suggest that these language learners developed co-agency. We conclude that our model should be tested in future studies that seek to illuminate the contribution of a new Eco-dialogical understanding of L2 learning and the potential for learners to have high quality languaging experiences in multiplayer 3D game environments and other social semiotically rich contexts.

NA,"vicarious traumatization and resilience of health workers","The critical role first aid responders, relief workers, and other medical personnel play in crisis and disaster settings cannot be understated. Especially in conflict areas, medical personnel face numerous threats to their security and physical well-being, putting them at risk of developing psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Because lay medics frequently function as the primary health providers in low-resource conflict situations, their mental health is crucial to the delivery of services to afflicted populations. In this chapter we examine the experiences of community health workers who serve displaced and war-affected populations in Karen State, eastern Burma. The evidence presented is based on the authors' previous qualitative research with this population. Though it is impossible to neatly deconstruct the myriad experiences of suffering, perseverance, and survivorship intrinsic to these medics' lives into the academic frameworks of psychology and psychiatry, an attempt at finding patterns in their narratives that parallel concepts in mental health literature may be helpful in developing evidence-based interventions. Incongruities are implicit in generalizations, and constant awareness of cultural relativism among widely different societal and linguistic norms must be maintained.

This tension is particularly strong for boys. In this context, violating the linguistic norms of the classroom is one way of rebelling and constructing a masculine identity which can gain peer approval. The rebellious and playful identities of the boys in this study are at times in conflict with their desire to be productive and high-achieving. In this study of an English Mother Tongue classroom in a German-American bilingual school in Berlin, Germany, five boys are faced with this dilemma. One tactic used by some of the boys to resolve the conflict is the use of Mock NSE. The use of Mock NSE by these boys is a salient socio-pragmatic device for indicating how they wish to be identified. These boys thus make use of the classroom norm of speaking Standard English by flouting it, creating new and multiple identities.

The analysis of the data shows that the students, the majority of which are of migrant background, systematically fail to employ Catalan, the language of schooling, and that the teachers refuse to enforce official linguistic norms. Rather than considering it exclusively a language issue, we claim that language is an index of a process of constructing the school as 'different' and the school body as non-academic. In the analysis of discourses and practices, social class emerges as one of the grounding motivations for such 'difference', which leads to low academic demands, a life skills educational perspective, and lack of competence in Catalan, with serious consequences for students’ social access.

NA,"the social origins of language","This book offers an exciting new perspective on the origins of language. Language is conceptualized as a collective invention, on the model of writing or the wheel, and the book places social and cultural dynamics at the centre of its evolution: language emerged and further developed in human communities already suffused with meaning and communication, mimesis, ritual, song and dance, coparenting, new divisions of labour, and revolutionary changes in social relations. The book thus challenges assumptions about the causal relations between genes, capacities, social communication, and innovation: the biological capacities are taken to evolve incrementally on the basis of cognitive plasticity, in a process that recruits previous adaptations and fine-tunes them to serve novel communicative ends. Topics include the ability brought about by language to tell lies, which must have confronted our ancestors with new problems of public trust; the dynamics of social-cognitive co-evolution; the role of gesture and mimesis in linguistic communication; studies of how monkeys and apes express their feelings or thoughts; play, laughter, dance, song, ritual, and other social displays among extant hunter-gatherers; the social nature of language acquisition and innovation; normativity and the emergence of linguistic norms; the interaction of language and emotions; and novel perspectives on the timeframe for language evolution. The contributors are leading international scholars from linguistics, anthropology, paleontology, primatology, psychology, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence, archaeology, and cognitive science.

(2005). Poirier, Boivin, Trepanier & Verreault 1994 gave us the first general overview of the French linguistic legacy in North America. Valdman and his team have updated that work, incorporating the findings of sociolinguistic research carried out over the past decade, notably in language obsolescence. The result is comprehensive treatment of all the main areas of North America where French is spoken. It is well organized, with an introductory chapter providing a succinct overview of the four sections to follow: The first describes where, how, and to what extent French is spoken in North America; the second examines language variation in each of these areas and the effects of language contact; the third looks at linguistic norms and language planning; and a fourth is devoted to more general comparative and historical issues. It is possible to point to improvements that could have been incorporated into the volume. There are occasional production blemishes. However, this volume offers an invaluable tool not only for students of French but also for sociolinguists concerned with the effects of language contact, language change, and language obsolescence.

Examining the linguistic landscape of public spaces exposes issues of linguistic tensions, language vitality, and language shift in multilingual settings. While Chinese in the form of Mandarin is highly publicized, thereby placing disproportionate emphasis upon one language over others, Philadelphia Chinatown shows diversity, coexistence, and creative uses of multiple Chinese languages alongside English. The signage suggests linguistic rescaling connecting real and imagined audiences, conforming to broader 'Chinese' linguistic norms while localized to connect to a range of Chineses. We show how linguistic and cultural pluralism of 'Chinese' have always existed—and continue to exist—and the importance of developing socially sensitive literacy pedagogy, especially when there is a mismatch between the informal, community-level signage and what is formally taught in 'Chinese' language classrooms in the U.S. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Written Language and Literacy",2012,"No","linguist cultur plural chines languag languag literaci educ languag linguist literaci multicultur dialect linguist landscap heritag languag literaci educ case studi linguist rescal philadelphia chinatown paper investig way languag philadelphia chinatown qualit content analysi photo examin linguist landscap public space expos issu linguist tension languag vital languag shift multilingu set chines form mandarin high public place disproportion emphasi languag philadelphia chinatown show divers coexist creativ multipl chines languag alongsid english signag suggest linguist rescal connect real imagin audienc conform broader chines linguist norm local connect rang chines show linguist cultur plural chines exist continu exist import develop social sensit literaci pedagogi mismatch inform communiti level signag formal taught chines languag classroom psycinfo databas record apa right reserv",0

This article examines briefly how a linguistic norm came to serve the whole of Iceland and how a situation of relative linguistic homogeneity was maintained for centuries. Sociolinguistic theory tells us that the speech community that we can reconstruct for early Iceland should lead to the establishment and maintenance of local norms. However, Iceland, arguably monodialectal, was certainly characterized by long-term linguistic homogeneity and remained a society where nucleated settlements barely formed over a thousand-year period. Scholars have argued that a mixture of dialects leveled shortly after the settlement of Iceland in the ninth century (Settlement). Studies show that dialect leveling requires dialect mixing, the convergence of people on one place, and sustained linguistic contact between the speakers. The settlement pattern of Iceland is indicative of population divergence (not convergence) and there is limited evidence of sustained contact. It is therefore proposed that the dialect leveling might be linked instead with significant population movements and social upheaval in mainland Scandinavia in the immediate pre-Viking period. The variety of Norse that was taken westward across the Atlantic might itself already have been the result of several earlier stages of mixing and koineization. It is only by combining linguistic, historical, and archaeological knowledge that this problem of how one linguistic norm came to serve the whole of Iceland can be understood.

It illustrates the interaction between locally circulating metadiscourses about children’s dispositions, intentions, and identities and the enforcement of classroom norms of respect. In some cases, teachers accommodated to children’s linguistic norms though a metadiscourse that reframed the indexicality of potentially disrespectful behavior. In other cases, forms of bodily demeanor were naturalized as indexical of children’s deliberate communication of disrespect. Teachers’ classroom narratives presented theories of affective accommodation and affective display, where respect for a teacher’s feelings was supposed to be given priority over respect for a child’s feelings, but children did not always comply with these theories. By illustrating how teachers’ metapragmatic ideologies about children’s identities as Korean Americans, contexts of language acquisition, and linguistic needs mediate the interactional construction of (dis)respect, this paper demonstrates the hybrid/multidirectional nature of language socialization.

"leader identities, workplace environment, teasing, social identities, discursive style, communicative behaviors, Communication Skills, Leadership, Social Identity, Teasing, Working Conditions","constructing leader identities through teasing at work","Workplaces constitute important sites where individuals construct and negotiate their various social identities. And one of the most crucial sites where this identity construction takes place is in working groups (which often form communities of practice). Over time, these groups may develop a shared repertoire of linguistic norms on which members regularly draw when interacting with each other. Drawing on over 40 h of authentic discourse data, this paper illustrates how three leaders construct their professional identities by using teasing humour in ways that exploit the specific discursive norms that characterise their respective working groups. Teasing comprises a valuable component of the linguistic repertoire negotiated among group members. This discourse strategy not only constitutes a prime means for identity construction but also assists the leaders in achieving their various workplace objectives. A comparison of the ways in which the leaders use teasing humour indicates substantial pragmatic differences in their choice of teasing style. These differences reflect, contribute to and reinforce the normative communicative behaviours which characterise the leaders’ working groups. By systematically drawing on the discursive style developed in their respective community of practice, the leaders 'do leadership' in ways that are considered appropriate and normative in their workplace.

Consider how often both men and women have thought or said 'bitch' or other derogatory terms when describing a woman in a leadership position. Freud once described mental health as the ability to love and to work. For many of these women, their work has also become their love, their passion. Working long hours, often working 'twice as hard as men,' to be viewed as equally competent, perhaps sacrificing spouse and children in deference to career, these women have been inculcated into a patriarchal corporate environment, one in which they must act in a sexual dissonant manner in order to succeed. And as they negotiate the male managerial model, they often come to view their own femininity in an objectified, disparaging way. They may defeminize their language and adopt a 'more adversarial, information-focused style characteristic of all male talk'. Here is where the dilemma begins: If they conform to the masculine linguistic norms of the corporate environment, then their behavior can be perceived as confrontational, harsh, contentious, un-lady-like. A collision of culture ensues on intrapsychic and interpersonal levels between what is expected of a woman in society and what is expected of a person in a high status position where valued leadership traits are male-gendered. Often these women select language and styles that veer away from the feminine side of the gender spectrum.

This book addresses the impact of digital technologies on reading and writing practices by contextualizing these developments within the communication technologies that have preceded them. Though computers are often blamed for a perceived deterioration of culture and language, Baron notes that scorn and mistrust of communication technologies is not a new phenomenon; in fact, writing, the printing press, and the telegraph were all greeted at first with skepticism. And despite the pervasive anxiety that 'internet speech' is resulting in the destruction of grammar and spelling, Baron observes that online communities enforce their own linguistic norms. Rather than a linguistic free-for-all, Baron argues, 'spelling counts' in virtual spaces just as it does offline. In sum, Baron accounts for both the benefits and pitfalls of the digital revolution and analyzes it as merely another set of technological innovations, usefully situating them within a history of writing technologies.

Leung has drawn attention to possibly the most obvious gap in our treatment: a properly elaborated discussion of the assessment of English as a lingua franca. While consideration of this issue has begun in the work of authors he cites in his review, and elsewhere, it is, as Leung points out, a multiply complex issue, in which the social dimension is the crux of the problem, ‘in terms of speaker subject positions, lexicogrammatical norms, transcultural pragmatic conventions and so on’. It is clear that language testing—particularly significant here as a site of authority about linguistic norms, not unlike a dictionary—has an important role to play in authorizing or de-authorizing English as a lingua franca communication as a proper target for language learning; a further demonstration, if one were needed, of the power of tests. But beyond this political and institutional dimension, the psychometric problems inherent in designing tests based on a construct that is local, situated, and fluid pose a difficult but productive challenge to testers.

NA,"slang and swearing as markers of inclusion and exclusion in adolescence","It is important that a book on adolescence should contain a chapter on slang and swearing because these are two features of adolescent linguistic behavior that attract more attention than they perhaps warrant, symbolizing as they do, the freedom that young people have at this stage of their lives to challenge linguistic norms, and at the same time to test interpersonal bonds and institutional constraints with their parents as they seek to establish new identities and relationships within their changing worlds. This chapter will start by providing a brief background description of the linguistic characteristics of slang and swearing before moving to a more focused discussion of why (although such language is also commonly used by many adult groups who find themselves living in close proximity in institutionalized contexts such as prisons or military camps), it may be particularly typical of adolescent speech. Subsequent sections of the chapter explore how the use of slang and expletives by young people can be viewed as a means of building cultural capital within their networks, while at the same time establishing boundaries between new adolescent in-groups ('us') and parents and nonmembers ('them'). A section on the use of pejorative terms further develops this theme of 'us' and 'them.' In addition, I also consider gender-based patterns of the ways young people use slang and expletives, and the subtle coercive effect such words have in regulating typical patterns of in-group behavior. Finally some suggestions are made regarding research questions that still require attention.

"language names, language norms, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Institutionalization, Language, Names, Social Norms","language names and norms in bosnia and herzegovina","The institutionalization of separate standard varieties for Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian in the 1990s was hailed by many Bosnians as the long-denied recognition of the Bosnian idiom as distinct from the Serbian and Croatian varieties it had so often been subordinated under. Yet the accompanying codification of Bosnian standard language forms has been highly controversial in Bosnia, and debates continue today about how to define the Bosnian language My dissertation explores the paradox that while many Bosnians support the Bosnian language as a name, they often do not support it as a norm . To explore this paradox, I undertook 12 months of fieldwork in four different middle schools in Bosnia. Education is a domain in which linguistic norms are highlighted. In Bosnia, it is also an area in which language variation is deemed to be particularly problematic by observers, participants, and commentators both locally and abroad. The decentralized nature of education in Bosnia means that classrooms are often ethnically segregated and curricula in use across the country are not harmonized. Language standardization has often been analyzed as a state-sponsored process that works through official institutions to reduce heterogeneity and promote uniform understandings of linguistic forms and their semiotic meanings. This dissertation explores ongoing language standardization campaigns in Bosnia and Herzegovina and argues that traditional ways of understanding the role of institutions in language standardization don't explain why standardization has been so unsuccessful in the post-war Bosnian state. My research challenges the idea that institutions must be engaged in drawing rigid us/them boundaries to be thought of as representative or legitimate, instead pointing to the possibility that ambiguity can be a marker of legitimacy rather than a threat to it. This dissertation explores how ideologies of heterogeneity and free choice in language work against the imposition of a standard norm at the same time as European aspirations and ideas about post-socialist normalcy push many Bosnians to believe their country should have such a standard. The resulting tension is the space in which choice between standard variants takes on social meaning and contributes to emerging definitions of what it means to be Bosnian.

An integration with psychological theory, with justice to the complexities of linguistic structure, is attempted. Fundamentally, speech behavior is a series of movements in which certain uniformities can be found.

The linguistic response-type is defined as any uniformity in speech behavior which exhibits a certain behavioral structure. This common behavioral structure is characterized in some detail. Employing the qualifications listed, one can separate linguistic from nonlinguistic behavior. The former includes all speech behavior as well as many nonvocal gestures. Psychological properties of linguistic response-types are to be studied in terms of their strength. Thus verbal behavior 'is seen as a series of movements patterned in overlapping units. The uniformities underlying these movements exist as behavioral habits, or response-types, the strengths of which are subject to continual change.'

Thus, disadvantage in general is characterized as a result of social forces that cause the victims to adopt cultural and linguistic norms that are different from those of middle-class society. In sum, the author presents an honest appraisal of an important social issue.

We use this method to compare three smoothing methods and consider the results in light of the differences among the models.

Rather than each word of the sentence being presented in succession, two words are presented at the same time, and the participant must choose which word is a grammatical continuation of the sentence. This procedure forces the reader into an incremental mode of processing in which each word must be fully integrated with the preceding context before the next word can be considered. Previous research with this technique has not considered whether it is sufficiently sensitive to syntactic complexity effects or to garden path effects. Four experiments are reported demonstrating that reliable differences in processing time for subject relatives and object relatives can be obtained, and that this technique generates garden path effects that correspond closely with the data from eyetracking experiments, but without the spillover effects that are sometimes obtained with eyetracking.

"KeywordsSemantic analysis Surveys Survey response Semantic theory of survey response (STSR) Attitude strength ","the failing measurement of attitudes how semantic determinants of individual survey responses come to replace measures of attitude strength","The traditional understanding of data from Likert scales is that the quantifications involved result from measures of attitude strength. Applying a recently proposed semantic theory of survey response, we claim that survey responses tap two different sources: a mixture of attitudes plus the semantic structure of the survey. Exploring the degree to which individual responses are influenced by semantics, we hypothesized that in many cases, information about attitude strength is actually filtered out as noise in the commonly used correlation matrix. We developed a procedure to separate the semantic influence from attitude strength in individual response patterns, and compared these results to, respectively, the observed sample correlation matrices and the semantic similarity structures arising from text analysis algorithms. This was done with four datasets, comprising a total of 7,787 subjects and 27,461,502 observed item pair responses. As we argued, attitude strength seemed to account for much information about the individual respondents. However, this information did not seem to carry over into the observed sample correlation matrices, which instead converged around the semantic structures offered by the survey items. This is potentially disturbing for the traditional understanding of what survey data represent. We argue that this approach contributes to a better understanding of the cognitive processes involved in survey responses.

"KeywordsSemantics Semantic judgment Best-worst scaling Rating scales Numeric estimation ","when is best worst best a comparison of best worst scaling numeric estimation and rating scales for collection of semantic norms","Large-scale semantic norms have become both prevalent and influential in recent psycholinguistic research. However, little attention has been directed towards understanding the methodological best practices of such norm collection efforts. We compared the quality of semantic norms obtained through rating scales, numeric estimation, and a less commonly used judgment format called best-worst scaling. We found that best-worst scaling usually produces norms with higher predictive validities than other response formats, and does so requiring less data to be collected overall. We also found evidence that the various response formats may be producing qualitatively, rather than just quantitatively, different data. This raises the issue of potential response format bias, which has not been addressed by previous efforts to collect semantic norms, likely because of previous reliance on a single type of response format for a single type of semantic judgment. We have made available software for creating best-worst stimuli and scoring best-worst data. We also made available new norms for age of acquisition, valence, arousal, and concreteness collected using best-worst scaling. These norms include entries for 1,040 words, of which 1,034 are also contained in the ANEW norms (Bradley & Lang, Affective norms for English words (ANEW): Instruction manual and affective ratings (pp. 1-45).

With the aim of contrasting verbal and nonverbal processing in the auditory modality, we developed a new on-line measure that can be administered to subjects from different clinical, neurological, or sociocultural groups.

Our results showed that, in general, the frequency norms from SUBTLEX-US and WorldLex–Blog tended to predict L2 performance better in reaction times, whereas the frequency norms from corpora with a mixture of written and spoken genres (CELEX, WorldLex–Blog, BNC, ANC, and COCA) tended to predict L2 accuracy better. Although replicated in both low- and high-proficiency L2 English learners, these patterns were not exactly the same as those found in LDT data from native English speakers.

"KeywordsContent analysis Intercoder reliability Semantic feature norms ","reliability in content analysis the case of semantic feature norms classification","Semantic feature norms (e.g., STIMULUS: car → RESPONSE: <has four wheels>) are commonly used in cognitive psychology to look into salient aspects of given concepts. Semantic features are typically collected in experimental settings and then manually annotated by the researchers into feature types (e.g., perceptual features, taxonomic features, etc.) by means of content analyses—that is, by using taxonomies of feature types and having independent coders perform the annotation task. However, the ways in which such content analyses are typically performed and reported are not consistent across the literature. This constitutes a serious methodological problem that might undermine the theoretical claims based on such annotations. In this study, we first offer a review of some of the released datasets of annotated semantic feature norms and the related taxonomies used for content analysis. We then provide theoretical and methodological insights in relation to the content analysis methodology. Finally, we apply content analysis to a new dataset of semantic features and show how the method should be applied in order to deliver reliable annotations and replicable coding schemes. We tackle the following issues: (1) taxonomy structure, (2) the description of categories, (3) coder training, and (4) sustainability of the coding scheme—that is, comparison of the annotations provided by trained versus novice coders. The outcomes of the project are threefold: We provide methodological guidelines for semantic feature classification; we provide a revised and adapted taxonomy that can (arguably) be applied to both concrete and abstract concepts; and we provide a dataset of annotated semantic feature norms.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","content analysi intercod reliabl semant featur norm reliabl content analysi case semant featur norm classif semant featur norm stimulus car respons wheel common cognit psycholog salient aspect concept semant featur typic collect experiment set manual annot research featur type perceptu featur taxonom featur mean content analys taxonomi featur type independ coder perform annot task way content analys typic perform report consist literatur constitut methodolog problem undermin theoret claim base annot studi offer review releas dataset annot semant featur norm relat taxonomi content analysi provid theoret methodolog insight relat content analysi methodolog final appli content analysi dataset semant featur show method appli order deliv reliabl annot replic code scheme tackl issu taxonomi structur descript categori coder train sustain code scheme comparison annot provid train versus novic coder outcom project threefold provid methodolog guidelin semant featur classif provid revis adapt taxonomi arguabl appli concret abstract concept provid dataset annot semant featur norm",0

If the object task also has high internal reliability, it can improve accuracy and power in group analyses (e.g., mean inversion effects for faces vs. objects), individual-difference studies (e.g., correlations between certain perceptual abilities and face/object recognition), and case studies in neuropsychology (e.g., whether a prosopagnosic shows a face-specific or object-general deficit). Here, we present such a task. Our Cambridge Car Memory Test (CCMT) was matched in format to the established Cambridge Face Memory Test, requiring recognition of exemplars across view and lighting change. We tested 153 young adults (93 female). Results showed high reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .84) and a range of scores suitable both for normal-range individual-difference studies and, potentially, for diagnosis of impairment. The mean for males was much higher than the mean for females. We demonstrate independence between face memory and car memory (dissociation based on sex, plus a modest correlation between the two), including where participants have high relative expertise with cars. We also show that expertise with real car makes and models of the era used in the test significantly predicts CCMT performance. Surprisingly, however, regression analyses imply that there is an effect of sex per se on the CCMT that is not attributable to a stereotypical male advantage in car expertise.","Behavior Research Methods",2012,"No","object recognit face recognit agnosia class discrimin expertis sex differ cambridg car memori test task match format cambridg face memori test norm reliabl sex differ dissoci face memori expertis effect research question requir class object recognit task match general cognit requir face recognit task object task high intern reliabl improv accuraci power group analys invers effect face object individu differ studi correl perceptu abil faceobject recognit case studi neuropsycholog prosopagnos show face specif object general deficit present task cambridg car memori test ccmt match format establish cambridg face memori test requir recognit exemplar view light chang test young adult femal result show high reliabl cronbach alpha rang score suitabl normal rang individu differ studi potenti diagnosi impair male higher femal demonstr independ face memori car memori dissoci base sex modest correl includ particip high relat expertis car show expertis real car make model era test signific predict ccmt perform surpris regress analys impli effect sex se ccmt attribut stereotyp male advantag car expertis",0

"KeywordsProperty listing task Conceptual property norms Inter-subject variability Conceptual agreement theory ","the role of variability in the property listing task","It is generally believed that concepts can be characterized by their properties (or features). When investigating concepts encoded in language, researchers often ask subjects to produce lists of properties that describe them (i.e., the Property Listing Task, PLT). These lists are accumulated to produce Conceptual Property Norms (CPNs). CPNs contain frequency distributions of properties for individual concepts. It is widely believed that these distributions represent the underlying semantic structure of those concepts. Here, instead of focusing on the underlying semantic structure, we aim at characterizing the PLT. An often disregarded aspect of the PLT is that individuals show intersubject variability (i.e., they produce only partially overlapping lists). In our study we use a mathematical analysis of this intersubject variability to guide our inquiry. To this end, we resort to a set of publicly available norms that contain information about the specific properties that were informed at the individual subject level. Our results suggest that when an individual is performing the PLT, he or she generates a list of properties that is a mixture of general and distinctive properties, such that there is a non-linear tendency to produce more general than distinctive properties. Furthermore, the low generality properties are precisely those that tend not to be repeated across lists, accounting in this manner for part of the intersubject variability. In consequence, any manipulation that may affect the mixture of general and distinctive properties in lists is bound to change intersubject variability. We discuss why these results are important for researchers using the PLT.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","properti list task conceptu properti norm inter subject variabl conceptu agreement theori role variabl properti list task general believ concept character properti featur investig concept encod languag research subject produc list properti describ properti list task plt list accumul produc conceptu properti norm cpns cpns frequenc distribut properti individu concept wide believ distribut repres under semant structur concept focus under semant structur aim character plt disregard aspect plt individu show intersubject variabl produc partial overlap list studi mathemat analysi intersubject variabl guid inquiri end resort set public norm inform specif properti inform individu subject level result suggest individu perform plt generat list properti mixtur general distinct properti linear tendenc produc general distinct properti low general properti precis tend repeat list account manner part intersubject variabl consequ manipul affect mixtur general distinct properti list bound chang intersubject variabl discuss result import research plt",0

The present study compares paper and Internet administrations of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) Scale (Wallston & Wallston, 1981). In terms of reliabilities and factor structures, the Internet data were found to be at least as good as the paper data.

"KeywordsWord meaning Word associations Concepts Psycholinguistics Semantics ","estimating affective word covariates using word association data","Word ratings on affective dimensions are an important tool in psycholinguistic research. Traditionally, they are obtained by asking participants to rate words on each dimension, a time-consuming procedure. As such, there has been some interest in computationally generating norms, by extrapolating words’ affective ratings using their semantic similarity to words for which these values are already known. So far, most attempts have derived similarity from word co-occurrence in text corpora. In the current paper, we obtain similarity from word association data. We use these similarity ratings to predict the valence, arousal, and dominance of 14,000 Dutch words with the help of two extrapolation methods: Orientation towards Paradigm Words and k-Nearest Neighbors. The resulting estimates show very high correlations with human ratings when using Orientation towards Paradigm Words, and even higher correlations when using k-Nearest Neighbors. We discuss possible theoretical accounts of our results and compare our findings with previous attempts at computationally generating affective norms.","Behavior Research Methods",2016,"No","word mean word associ concept psycholinguist semant estim affect word covari word associ data word rate affect dimens import tool psycholinguist research tradit obtain particip rate word dimens time consum procedur interest comput generat norm extrapol word affect rate semant similar word valu attempt deriv similar word occurr text corpora current paper obtain similar word associ data similar rate predict valenc arous domin dutch word extrapol method orient paradigm word nearest neighbor result estim show high correl human rate orient paradigm word higher correl nearest neighbor discuss theoret account result compar find previous attempt comput generat affect norm",0
"KeywordsMoral judgment Vignette Moral Assessment Sex ","a brief assessment tool for investigating facets of moral judgment from realistic vignettes","Humans make moral judgments every day, and research demonstrates that these evaluations are based on a host of related event features (e.g., harm, legality). In order to acquire systematic data on how moral judgments are made, our assessments need to be expanded to include real-life, ecologically valid stimuli that take into account the numerous event features that are known to influence moral judgment. To facilitate this, Knutson et al. (in Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 5(4), 378–384, 2010) developed vignettes based on real-life episodic memories rated concurrently on key moral features; however, the method is time intensive (~1.4–3.4 h) and the stimuli and ratings require further validation and characterization. The present study addresses these limitations by: (i) validating three short subsets of these vignettes (39 per subset) that are time-efficient (10–25 min per subset) yet representative of the ratings and factor structure of the full set, (ii) norming ratings of moral features in a larger sample (total N = 661, each subset N = ~220 vs. Knutson et al. N = 30), (iii) examining the generalizability of the original factor structure by replicating it in a larger sample across vignette subsets, sex, and political ideology, and (iv) using latent profile analysis to empirically characterize vignette groupings based on event feature ratings profiles and vignette content. This study therefore provides researchers with a core battery of well-characterized and realistic vignettes, concurrently rated on key moral features that can be administered in a brief, time-efficient manner to advance research on the nature of moral judgment.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","moral judgment vignett moral assess sex assess tool investig facet moral judgment realist vignett human make moral judgment day research demonstr evalu base host relat event featur harm legal order acquir systemat data moral judgment made assess expand includ real life ecolog valid stimuli account numer event featur influenc moral judgment facilit knutson al social cognit affect neurosci develop vignett base real life episod memori rate concurr key moral featur method time intens stimuli rate requir valid character present studi address limit valid short subset vignett subset time effici min subset repres rate factor structur full set ii norm rate moral featur larger sampl total subset knutson al iii examin generaliz origin factor structur replic larger sampl vignett subset sex polit ideolog iv latent profil analysi empir character vignett group base event featur rate profil vignett content studi research core batteri character realist vignett concurr rate key moral featur administ time effici manner advanc research natur moral judgment",0

"KeywordsConcreteness Semantic variables List memory Methodology ","statistical and methodological problems with concreteness and other semantic variables a list memory experiment case study","The purpose of this article is to highlight problems with a range of semantic psycholinguistic variables (concreteness, imageability, individual modality norms, and emotional valence) and to provide a way of avoiding these problems. Focusing on concreteness, I show that for a large class of words in the Brysbaert, Warriner, and Kuperman (Behavior Research Methods 46: 904–911, 2013) concreteness norms, the mean concreteness values do not reflect the judgments that actual participants made. This problem applies to nearly every word in the middle of the concreteness scale. Using list memory experiments as a case study, I show that many of the “abstract” stimuli in concreteness experiments are not unequivocally abstract. Instead, they are simply those words about which participants tend to disagree. I report three replications of list memory experiments in which the contrast between concrete and abstract stimuli was maximized, so that the mean concreteness values were accurate reflections of participants’ judgments. The first two experiments did not produce a concreteness effect. After I introduced an additional control, the third experiment did produce a concreteness effect. The article closes with a discussion of the implications of these results, as well as a consideration of variables other than concreteness. The sensorimotor experience variables (imageability and individual modality norms) show the same distribution as concreteness. The distribution of emotional valence scores is healthier, but variability in ratings takes on a special significance for this measure because of how the scale is constructed. I recommend that researchers using these variables keep the standard deviations of the ratings of their stimuli as low as possible.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","concret semant variabl list memori methodolog statist methodolog problem concret semant variabl list memori experi case studi purpos articl highlight problem rang semant psycholinguist variabl concret imag individu modal norm emot valenc provid avoid problem focus concret show larg class word brysbaert warrin kuperman behavior research method concret norm concret valu reflect judgment actual particip made problem appli word middl concret scale list memori experi case studi show abstract stimuli concret experi unequivoc abstract simpli word particip tend disagre report replic list memori experi contrast concret abstract stimuli maxim concret valu accur reflect particip judgment experi produc concret effect introduc addit control experi produc concret effect articl close discuss implic result consider variabl concret sensorimotor experi variabl imag individu modal norm show distribut concret distribut emot valenc score healthier variabl rate take special signific measur scale construct recommend research variabl standard deviat rate stimuli low",0

The relatedness of a final word to a sentence context has been estimated as the probability (cloze probability) that a participant will complete a sentence with a word. In four studies, I show that it is possible to estimate local context–word relatedness based on common language usage. Conditional probabilities were calculated for sentences with published cloze probabilities. Four-word contexts produced conditional probabilities significantly correlated with cloze probabilities, but usage statistics were unavailable for some sentence contexts. The present studies demonstrate that a composite context measure based on conditional probabilities for one- to four-word contexts and the presence of a final period represents all of the sentences and maintains significant correlations (.25, .52, .53) with cloze probabilities. Finally, the article provides evidence for the effectiveness of this measure by showing that local context varies in ways that are similar to the N400 effect and that are consistent with a role for local context in reading.

Next, the word association data were used to build an associative network to investigate the centrality of nodes. The study of node centrality showed that central nodes in the network tended to be highly frequent and acquired early. Small-world properties of the association network were investigated and compared with a large English association network (Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005). Networks based on a multiple association procedure showed small-world properties despite being denser than networks based on a discrete task. Finally, a semantic taxonomy was used to investigate the composition of semantic types in association responses. The majority of responses were thematically related situation responses and entity responses referring to parts, shape, or color.

Best-worst scaling generates a large quantity of information per judgment because each judgment allows for inferences about the rank value of all unjudged items. This property of best-worst scaling makes it a promising judgment format for research in psychology and natural language processing concerned with estimating the semantic properties of tens of thousands of words. A variety of different scoring algorithms have been devised in the previous literature on best-worst scaling. However, due to problems of computational efficiency, these scoring algorithms cannot be applied efficiently to cases in which thousands of items need to be scored. New algorithms are presented here for converting responses from best-worst scaling into item scores for thousands of items (many-item scoring problems). These scoring algorithms are validated through simulation and empirical experiments, and considerations related to noise, the underlying distribution of true values, and trial design are identified that can affect the relative quality of the derived item scores.

Its application is illustrated by control programs used to set up, execute, and analyze a series of interactive free recall experiments. While limitations of timesharing systems for experimental control surely exist, they can often be removed by simple hardware or software. Further, a large machine can provide significant advantages in cost and software development over dedicated laboratory minicomputers. It is possible to obtain the advantages of both types of systems by introducing local intelligence to provide more precise timing and flexible control of experimental devices, while retaining the power and hardware and software resources of the large machine.","Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation",1979,"No","free recal behavior research method stimulus item memori experi larg machin comput control memori experi larg scale timeshar system paper describ comput system run verbal learn memori experi larg scale timeshar comput applic illustr control program set execut analyz seri interact free recal experi limit timeshar system experiment control sure exist remov simpl hardwar softwar larg machin provid signific advantag cost softwar develop dedic laboratori minicomput obtain advantag type system introduc local intellig provid precis time flexibl control experiment devic retain power hardwar softwar resourc larg machin",0

"KeywordsPerceptual organization Screening test Neuropsychology Brain damage Mid-level vision Shape perception ","the leuven perceptual organization screening test l post an online test to assess mid level visual perception","Neuropsychological diagnostic tests of visual perception mostly assess high-level processes like object recognition. Object recognition, however, relies on distinct mid-level processes of perceptual organization that are only implicitly tested in classical tests. The Leuven Perceptual Organization Screening Test (L-POST) fills a gap with respect to clinically oriented tests of mid-level visual function. In 15 online subtests, a range of mid-level processes are covered, such as figure–ground segmentation, local and global processing, and shape perception. We also test the sensitivity to a wide variety of perceptual grouping cues, like common fate, collinearity, proximity, and closure. To reduce cognitive load, a matching-to-sample task is used for all subtests. Our online test can be administered in 20–45 min and is freely available at www.gestaltrevision.be/tests. The online implementation enables us to offer a separate interface for researchers and clinicians to have immediate access to the raw and summary results for each patient and to keep a record of their patient’s entire data. Also, each patient’s results can be flexibly compared with a range of age-matched norm samples. In conclusion, the L-POST is a valuable screening test for perceptual organization. The test allows clinicians to screen for deficits in visual perception and enables researchers to get a broader overview of mid-level visual processes that are preserved or disrupted in a given patient.","Behavior Research Methods",2014,"No","perceptu organ screen test neuropsycholog brain damag mid level vision shape percept leuven perceptu organ screen test post onlin test assess mid level visual percept neuropsycholog diagnost test visual percept assess high level process object recognit object recognit reli distinct mid level process perceptu organ implicit test classic test leuven perceptu organ screen test post fill gap respect clinic orient test mid level visual function onlin subtest rang mid level process cover figur ground segment local global process shape percept test sensit wide varieti perceptu group cue common fate collinear proxim closur reduc cognit load match sampl task subtest onlin test administ min freeli wwwgestaltrevisiontest onlin implement enabl offer separ interfac research clinician access raw summari result patient record patient entir data patient result flexibl compar rang age match norm sampl conclus post valuabl screen test perceptu organ test clinician screen deficit visual percept enabl research broader overview mid level visual process preserv disrupt patient",0

Despite its extensive use, selecting IAPS stimuli for a research project is not usually done according to an established strategy, but rather is tailored to individual studies. Here we propose a standard, replicable method for stimulus selection based on cluster analysis, which re-creates the group structure that is most likely to have produced the valence arousal, and dominance norms associated with the IAPS images. Our method includes screening the database for outliers, identifying a suitable clustering solution, and then extracting the desired number of stimuli on the basis of their level of certainty of belonging to the cluster they were assigned to. Our method preserves statistical power in studies by maximizing the likelihood that the stimuli belong to the cluster structure fitted to them, and by filtering stimuli according to their certainty of cluster membership. In addition, although our cluster-based method is illustrated using the IAPS, it can be extended to other stimulus databases.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","iap intern affect pictur system cluster analysi stimulus select emot cluster base approach select repres stimuli intern affect pictur system iap databas intern affect pictur system iap lang bradley cuthbert stimulus databas frequent investig aspect emot process extens select iap stimuli research project establish strategi tailor individu studi propos standard replic method stimulus select base cluster analysi creat group structur produc valenc arous domin norm iap imag method includ screen databas outlier identifi suitabl cluster solut extract desir number stimuli basi level certainti belong cluster assign method preserv statist power studi maxim likelihood stimuli belong cluster structur fit filter stimuli certainti cluster membership addit cluster base method illustr iap extend stimulus databas",0

However, accuracy is a function of line and length, and distance-from-hole measures confound these two factors. A scoring system for evaluating putting accuracy is described that enables the efficient measurement of errors in line and length. A camera placed above the hole takes digital photographs of the final position of the ball. A custom-developed program written in the National Instruments LabVIEW graphical programming language derives a variety of accuracy measures from these photographs, including distance from the hole, angle of error, distance short or long from the hole, and distance left or right from the hole. Evaluation of the system indicated that the measures were as accurate as manual measurements and were reliable when rescored on separate occasions.

"KeywordsComputational modeling Semantic space Word association Dynamic change Predictive modeling Representation of political concepts ","speaking two languages in america a semantic space analysis of how presidential candidates and their supporters represent abstract political concepts differently","In this article we report a computational semantic analysis of the presidential candidates’ speeches in the two major political parties in the USA. In Study One, we modeled the political semantic spaces as a function of party, candidate, and time of election, and findings revealed patterns of differences in the semantic representation of key political concepts and the changing landscapes in which the presidential candidates align or misalign with their parties in terms of the representation and organization of politically central concepts. Our models further showed that the 2016 US presidential nominees had distinct conceptual representations from those of previous election years, and these patterns did not necessarily align with their respective political parties’ average representation of the key political concepts. In Study Two, structural equation modeling demonstrated that reported political engagement among voters differentially predicted reported likelihoods of voting for Clinton versus Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Study Three indicated that Republicans and Democrats showed distinct, systematic word association patterns for the same concepts/terms, which could be reliably distinguished using machine learning methods. These studies suggest that given an individual’s political beliefs, we can make reliable predictions about how they understand words, and given how an individual understands those same words, we can also predict an individual’s political beliefs. Our study provides a bridge between semantic space models and abstract representations of political concepts on the one hand, and the representations of political concepts and citizens’ voting behavior on the other.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","comput model semant space word associ dynam chang predict model represent polit concept speak languag america semant space analysi presidenti candid support repres abstract polit concept differ articl report comput semant analysi presidenti candid speech major polit parti usa studi model polit semant space function parti candid time elect find reveal pattern differ semant represent key polit concept chang landscap presidenti candid align misalign parti term represent organ polit central concept model show presidenti nomine distinct conceptu represent previous elect year pattern necessarili align respect polit parti averag represent key polit concept studi structur equat model demonstr report polit engag voter differenti predict report likelihood vote clinton versus trump presidenti elect studi republican democrat show distinct systemat word associ pattern conceptsterm reliabl distinguish machin learn method studi suggest individu polit belief make reliabl predict understand word individu understand word predict individu polit belief studi bridg semant space model abstract represent polit concept hand represent polit concept citizen vote behavior",0
"KeywordsSerial testing Norms Practice effects Longitudinal data Linear mixed model Multiple imputation Stroop Color Word Test ","establishing normative data for repeated cognitive assessment a comparison of different statistical methods","Serial cognitive assessment is conducted to monitor changes in the cognitive abilities of patients over time. At present, mainly the regression-based change and the ANCOVA approaches are used to establish normative data for serial cognitive assessment. These methods are straightforward, but they have some severe drawbacks. For example, they can only consider the data of two measurement occasions. In this article, we propose three alternative normative methods that are not hampered by these problems—that is, multivariate regression, the standard linear mixed model (LMM), and the linear mixed model combined with multiple imputation (LMM with MI) approaches. The multivariate regression method is primarily useful when a small number of repeated measurements are taken at fixed time points. When the data are more unbalanced, the standard LMM and the LMM with MI methods are more appropriate because they allow for a more adequate modeling of the covariance structure. The standard LMM has the advantage that it is easier to conduct and that it does not require a Monte Carlo component. The LMM with MI, on the other hand, has the advantage that it can flexibly deal with missing responses and missing covariate values at the same time. The different normative methods are illustrated on the basis of the data of a large longitudinal study in which a cognitive test (the Stroop Color Word Test) was administered at four measurement occasions (i.e., at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 years later). The results are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"No","serial test norm practic effect longitudin data linear mix model multipl imput stroop color word test establish normat data repeat cognit assess comparison statist method serial cognit assess conduct monitor cognit abil patient time present regress base chang ancova approach establish normat data serial cognit assess method straightforward sever drawback data measur occas articl propos altern normat method hamper problem multivari regress standard linear mix model lmm linear mix model combin multipl imput lmm mi approach multivari regress method primarili small number repeat measur fix time point data unbalanc standard lmm lmm mi method adequ model covari structur standard lmm advantag easier conduct requir mont carlo compon lmm mi hand advantag flexibl deal miss respons miss covari valu time normat method illustr basi data larg longitudin studi cognit test stroop color word test administ measur occas baselin year result discuss suggest futur research provid",0
"KeywordsBayesian meta-analysis Picture naming Psycholinguistic norms ","which variables should be controlled for to investigate picture naming in adults a bayesian meta analysis","Selecting items for designing psycholinguistic experiments can be a very hard and time-consuming process, because of the large number of variables that need to be controlled for. This is clearly the case for picture-naming experiments because, thanks to the collection of psycholinguistic norms on both pictures and their names, a large number of factors that affect naming speed and/or accuracy have been found. In the present study, a Bayesian meta-analysis was performed to determine the extent to which the variables that have generally been considered by researchers as important to control for are indeed worth taking into account. The meta-analysis revealed that most of the variables that are considered in picture-naming studies have a strong or very strong influence on naming speed (image agreement, name agreement, image variability/imageability, age of acquisition, and conceptual familiarity), whereas two variables that are very often taken into account (visual complexity and length) yielded null effects. The results were inconclusive for lexical frequency. At a methodological level, Bayesian meta-analyses constitute a very useful tool for guiding researchers when selecting materials for experiments.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","bayesian meta analysi pictur name psycholinguist norm variabl control investig pictur name adult bayesian meta analysi select item design psycholinguist experi hard time consum process larg number variabl control case pictur name experi collect psycholinguist norm pictur name larg number factor affect name speed accuraci found present studi bayesian meta analysi perform determin extent variabl general consid research import control worth take account meta analysi reveal variabl consid pictur name studi strong strong influenc name speed imag agreement agreement imag variabilityimag age acquisit conceptu familiar variabl account visual complex length yield null effect result inconclus lexic frequenc methodolog level bayesian meta analys constitut tool guid research select materi experi",0
"KeywordsSelf-disclosure Sensitive information Sensitive question Data collection methods ","development and application of a self report measure for assessing sensitive information disclosures across multiple modes","Building on the literature that approaches self-disclosure as a decision-making process, we proposed a self-reported Sensitive Information Disclosure (SID) measure and tested the measure’s reliability and validity in two studies across a variety of interview modes and settings. We used theory to identify potential dimensions of sensitive information disclosures, created potential scale items, performed two separate card sorts, and validated the resulting pool of items in two separate experiments. Participants answered the SID scale items following an interview involving sensitive information, potential risk, and after-disclosure vulnerability. Study 1 was a laboratory experiment conducted with 165 university students. Exploratory factor analysis results revealed a two-factor structure, Personal Discomfort and Revealing Personal Information. Study 2 replicated these procedures using confirmatory factor analysis to confirm the factor structure and demonstrate the scale’s reliability and validity, with a sample of 77 students and 275 participants from Amazon’s M-Turk. Together, these results demonstrate that the proposed 11-item SID scale has good convergent and discriminant validity as well as good reliability. A quasi-experimental application of the measure is illustrated using the substantive findings from Study 2. This research fills a gap in the literature by developing a topic-free scale to measure SID as a dependent variable. The ability to accurately measure sensitive information disclosure is an important and necessary step toward developing a more thorough understanding of how people feel and react when asked to provide personal information in diverse interview settings.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","disclosur sensit inform sensit question data collect method develop applic report measur assess sensit inform disclosur multipl mode build literatur approach disclosur decis make process propos report sensit inform disclosur sid measur test measur reliabl valid studi varieti interview mode set theori identifi potenti dimens sensit inform disclosur creat potenti scale item perform separ card sort valid result pool item separ experi particip answer sid scale item interview involv sensit inform potenti risk disclosur vulner studi laboratori experi conduct univers student exploratori factor analysi result reveal factor structur person discomfort reveal person inform studi replic procedur confirmatori factor analysi confirm factor structur demonstr scale reliabl valid sampl student particip amazon turk result demonstr propos item sid scale good converg discrimin valid good reliabl quasi experiment applic measur illustr substant find studi research fill gap literatur develop topic free scale measur sid depend variabl abil accur measur sensit inform disclosur import step develop understand peopl feel react ask provid person inform divers interview set",0

"KeywordsInstructional manipulation checks Participant attentiveness MTurk College students ","attentive turkers mturk participants perform better on online attention checks than do subject pool participants","Participant attentiveness is a concern for many researchers using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Although studies comparing the attentiveness of participants on MTurk versus traditional subject pool samples have provided mixed support for this concern, attention check questions and other methods of ensuring participant attention have become prolific in MTurk studies. Because MTurk is a population that learns, we hypothesized that MTurkers would be more attentive to instructions than are traditional subject pool samples. In three online studies, participants from MTurk and collegiate populations participated in a task that included a measure of attentiveness to instructions (an instructional manipulation check: IMC). In all studies, MTurkers were more attentive to the instructions than were college students, even on novel IMCs (Studies 2 and 3), and MTurkers showed larger effects in response to a minute text manipulation. These results have implications for the sustainable use of MTurk samples for social science research and for the conclusions drawn from research with MTurk and college subject pool samples.","Behavior Research Methods",2016,"No","instruct manipul check particip attent mturk colleg student attent turker mturk particip perform onlin attent check subject pool particip particip attent concern research amazon mechan turk mturk studi compar attent particip mturk versus tradit subject pool sampl provid mix support concern attent check question method ensur particip attent prolif mturk studi mturk popul learn hypothes mturker attent instruct tradit subject pool sampl onlin studi particip mturk collegi popul particip task includ measur attent instruct instruct manipul check imc studi mturker attent instruct colleg student imc studi mturker show larger effect respons minut text manipul result implic sustain mturk sampl social scienc research conclus drawn research mturk colleg subject pool sampl",0

"KeywordsCorrect Response Test Taker Academic Dishonesty Erroneous Response Introductory Psychology Student ","a theory of cheating","The theory of motivated cheating postulates that test takers may cheat when they do not know an answer. With probabilityk, an “observer” is unsure of an answer and will copy from a nearby “target” with probabilityc. The corresponding parameters for the target may be entirely unrelated to those of the observer. Thus, the undesirable feature of bidirectionality of parameters found in correlational techniques is not an inherent feature of this theory of cheating. Predictions are derived, and estimates ofk andc are proposed. Statistically large values of c suggest that an observer was copying from a target. High values ofc for both the observer and the target suggest collusion. The theory is applied to a 40-item five-choice test taken by students in an introductory psychology section.

The goal of the present study was to validate the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS; Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X; Watson & Clark, 1994), and the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS; Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999) for use on the Internet. This study compared the quality of data collected using paper-based (paper-and-pencil version in a lab setting), computer-based (Web-based version in a lab setting), and Internet (Web-based version on a computer of the participant’s choosing) surveys for these three measures of SWB. The paper-based and computer-based experiment recruited two college student samples; the Internet experiments recruited a college student sample and an adult sample responding to ads on different social-networking Web sites.

The results are controversial, and the investigation of the active component has been inhibited by the absence of any appropriate experimental procedures. A new task was developed involving the mental reconstruction of pictures of objects from fragmented pieces, and this provides a useful procedure for exploring active visuospatial processing. Significant differences in terms of both correctness and response latency were obtained between young and older adults and between younger old and older old adults.

Sixty males and 60 females wrote five stories to TAT pictures either on the computer or by hand. Half of each group were timed and half untimed. The writing of stories was guided by four sets of questions, and stories were coded for need for power (n Pow) by the corresponding four paragraphs. Cronbach’s alpha for the five stories was .46; for the 20 paragraphs, Cronbach’s alpha was .65. We conclude that, to the extent that measuring internal consistency is appropriate for a thought-sampling instrument like the TAT, internal consistency should be calculated by paragraphs. Significantly more words were produced in the untimed condition, but n Pow did not differ by gender, hand-written versus computer-written, or timed versus untimed conditions. The five pictures elicited significantly different amounts of n Pow. It is recommended that researchers who give the TAT on the computer use the untimed condition.

"KeywordsRecognition Memory Study Phase Mean Amplitude Recognition Memory Task Current Word ","resampling approach to statistical inference bootstrapping from event related potentials data","We propose the use of the bootstrap resampling technique as a tool to assess the within-subject reliability of experimental modulation effects on event-related potentials (ERPs). The assessment of the within-subject reliability is relevant in all those cases when the subject score is obtained by some estimation procedure, such as averaging. In these cases, possible deviations from the assumptions on which the estimation procedure relies may lead to severely biased results and, consequently, to incorrect functional inferences. In this study, we applied bootstrap analysis to data from an experiment aimed at investigating the relationship between ERPs and memory processes. ERPs were recorded from two groups of subjects engaged in a recognition memory task. During the study phase, subjects in Group A were required to make an orthographic judgment on 160 visually presented words, whereas subjects in Group B were only required to pay attention to the words. During the test phase all subjects were presented with the 160 previously studied words along with 160 new words and were required to decide whether the current word was “old” or “new.” To assess the effect of word imagery value, half of the words had a high imagery value and half a low imagery value. Analyses of variance performed on ERPs showed that an imagery-induced modulation of the old/new effect was evident only for subjects who were not engaged in the orthographic task during the study phase. This result supports the hypothesis that this modulation is due to some aspect of the recognition memory process and not to the stimulus encoding operations that occur during the recognition memory task. However, bootstrap analysis on the same data showed that the old/new effect on ERPs was not reliable for all the subjects. This result suggests that only a cautious inference can be made from these data.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",2000,"No","recognit memori studi phase amplitud recognit memori task current word resampl approach statist infer bootstrap event relat potenti data propos bootstrap resampl techniqu tool assess subject reliabl experiment modul effect event relat potenti erp assess subject reliabl relev case subject score obtain estim procedur averag case deviat assumpt estim procedur reli lead sever bias result incorrect function infer studi appli bootstrap analysi data experi aim investig relationship erp memori process erp record group subject engag recognit memori task studi phase subject group requir make orthograph judgment visual present word subject group requir pay attent word test phase subject present previous studi word word requir decid current word assess effect word imageri half word high imageri half low imageri analys varianc perform erp show imageri induc modul effect evid subject engag orthograph task studi phase result support hypothesi modul due aspect recognit memori process stimulus encod oper occur recognit memori task bootstrap analysi data show effect erp reliabl subject result suggest cautious infer made data",0

A rebus combines verbal and visual clues to a common phrase, such as PAINS (“growing pains”). Solving a rebus requires breaking implicit assumptions of normal reading, similar to the restructuring required in insight. We hypothesized that, the more implicit assumptions are involved, the more difficult the solution. The results of a two-part experiment supported the hypothesis, with participants solving more problems involving one assumption than they did problems involving two or more. Also, rebus performance correlated significantly with self-rated insight and with scores on remote associates, but not with general verbal ability.

"KeywordsStatokinesigram Normalization Method Anthropometry Stabilometry ","statokinesigram normalization method"," Stabilometry is a technique that aims to study the body sway of human subjects, employing a force platform. The signal obtained from this technique refers to the position of the foot base ground-reaction vector, known as the center of pressure (CoP). The parameters calculated from the signal are used to quantify the displacement of the CoP over time; there is a large variability, both between and within subjects, which prevents the definition of normative values. The intersubject variability is related to differences between subjects in terms of their anthropometry, in conjunction with their muscle activation patterns (biomechanics); and the intrasubject variability can be caused by a learning effect or fatigue. Age and foot placement on the platform are also known to influence variability. Normalization is the main method used to decrease this variability and to bring distributions of adjusted values into alignment. In 1996, O’Malley proposed three normalization techniques to eliminate the effect of age and anthropometric factors from temporal-distance parameters of gait. These techniques were adopted to normalize the stabilometric signal by some authors. This paper proposes a new method of normalization of stabilometric signals to be applied in balance studies. The method was applied to a data set collected in a previous study, and the results of normalized and nonnormalized signals were compared. The results showed that the new method, if used in a well-designed experiment, can eliminate undesirable correlations between the analyzed parameters and the subjects’ characteristics and show only the experimental conditions’ effects.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","statokinesigram normal method anthropometri stabilometri statokinesigram normal method stabilometri techniqu aim studi bodi sway human subject employ forc platform signal obtain techniqu refer posit foot base ground reaction vector center pressur cop paramet calcul signal quantifi displac cop time larg variabl subject prevent definit normat valu intersubject variabl relat differ subject term anthropometri conjunct muscl activ pattern biomechan intrasubject variabl caus learn effect fatigu age foot placement platform influenc variabl normal main method decreas variabl bring distribut adjust valu align malley propos normal techniqu elimin effect age anthropometr factor tempor distanc paramet gait techniqu adopt normal stabilometr signal author paper propos method normal stabilometr signal appli balanc studi method appli data set collect previous studi result normal nonnorm signal compar result show method design experi elimin undesir correl analyz paramet subject characterist show experiment condit effect",0

The monocular test time of about 8 min, and the success rate—81% for 224 children aged 2–39 months—compare favorably with our experience with the manual two-operator test. For 39 pairs of age-matched children without visual pathology, grating acuities were 0.6 octaves better with the computerized test. The computerized version was used to measure acuity in 120 children who had, according to clinical examination, poorer vision in one eye than in the other. The suspect eyes showed an average of 0.8 octaves poorer grating acuity. The improvements of computerization were realized without loss of the advantages of the manual test.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",1989,"No","strabismus amblyopia computer test manual test acuiti test preferenti clinic acuiti test improv implement microcomput control manual oper preferenti grate acuiti test modifi includ micro comput control stimulus present data acquisit storag analysi computer test requir observ oper minim test bias error manual test techniqu develop observ oper mask generat transform staircas monocular test time min success rate children age month compar favor experi manual oper test pair age match children visual patholog grate acuiti octav computer test computer version measur acuiti children clinic examin poorer vision eye suspect eye show averag octav poorer grate acuiti improv computer realiz loss advantag manual test",0
"KeywordsResponse Time Probability Density Function Weibull Distribution Behavior Research Method True Parameter ","fitting distributions using maximum likelihood methods and packages","The most powerful tests of response time (RT) models often involve the whole shape of the RT distribution, thus avoiding mimicking that can occur at the level of RT means and variances. Nonpara-metric distribution estimation is, in principle, the most appropriate approach, but such estimators are sometimes difficult to obtain. On the other hand, distribution fitting, given an algebraic function, is both easy and compact. We review the general approach to performing distribution fitting with maximum likelihood (ML) and a method based on quantiles (quantile maximum probability, QMP). We show that QMP has both small bias and good efficiency when used with common distribution functions (the ex-Gaussian, Gumbel, lognormal, Wald, and Weibull distributions). In addition, we review some software packages performing ML (PASTIS, QMPE, DISFIT, and MATHEMATICA) and compare their results. In general, the differences between packages have little influence on the optimal solution found, but the form of the distribution function has: Both the lognormal and the Wald distributions have nonlinear dependencies between the parameter estimates that tend to increase the overall bias in parameter recovery and to decrease efficiency. We conclude by laying out a few pointers on how to relate descriptive models of RT to cognitive models of RT.

"KeywordsFace Recognition Appearance Model Facial Appearance Active Appearance Model Facial Landmark ","nonlinear near photo realistic caricatures using a parametric facial appearance model","A mathematical model previously developed for use in computer vision applications is presented as an empirical model for face space. The term appearance space is used to distinguish this from previous models. Appearance space is a linear vector space that is dimensionally optimal, enables us to model and describe any human facial appearance, and possesses characteristics that are plausible for the representation of psychological face space. Randomly sampling from a multivariate distribution for a location in appearance space produces entirely plausible faces, and manipulation of a small set of defining parameters enables the automatic generation of photo-realistic caricatures. The appearance space model leads us to the new concept of nonlinear caricatures, and we show that the accepted linear method for caricature is only a special case of a more general paradigm. Nonlinear methods are also viable, and we present examples of photographic quality caricatures, using a number of different transformation functions. Results of a simple experiment are presented that suggest that nonlinear transformations can accurately capture key aspects of the caricature effect. Finally, we discuss the relationship between appearance space, caricature, and facial distinctiveness. On the basis of our new theoretical framework, we suggest an experimental approach that can yield new evidence for the plausibility of face space and its ability to explain processes of recognition.","Behavior Research Methods",2005,"No","face recognit appear model facial appear activ appear model facial landmark nonlinear photo realist caricatur parametr facial appear model mathemat model previous develop comput vision applic present empir model face space term appear space distinguish previous model appear space linear vector space dimension optim enabl model describ human facial appear possess characterist plausibl represent psycholog face space random sampl multivari distribut locat appear space produc plausibl face manipul small set defin paramet enabl automat generat photo realist caricatur appear space model lead concept nonlinear caricatur show accept linear method caricatur special case general paradigm nonlinear method viabl present exampl photograph qualiti caricatur number transform function result simpl experi present suggest nonlinear transform accur captur key aspect caricatur effect final discuss relationship appear space caricatur facial distinct basi theoret framework suggest experiment approach yield evid plausibl face space abil explain process recognit",0

While studying the structure of network models has led to many important insights, little attention has been paid to how well they predict observations. This is despite the fact that predictability is crucial for judging the practical relevance of edges: for instance in clinical practice, predictability of a symptom indicates whether an intervention on that symptom through the symptom network is promising. We close this methodological gap by introducing nodewise predictability, which quantifies how well a given node can be predicted by all other nodes it is connected to in the network.

However, a number of questions in this domain, which are difficult to address with the available methodological resources, are still unresolved. We collected semantic transparency scores for 2,861 compound words at the constituent level (i.e., how strongly the overall meaning of a compound word is related to that of each constituent) and analyzed their effects on speeded pronunciation and lexical decision performance for the compound words using the English Lexicon Project (http://elexicon.wustl.edu) data. The results from both tasks indicated that our human-judged semantic transparency ratings for both the first and second constituents play a significant role in compound word processing. Moreover, additional analyses indicated that the human-judged semantic transparency scores at the constituent level accounted for more variance in compound word recognition performance than did either whole-word semantic transparency scores or corpus-based semantic distance scores.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","visual word recognit compound word megastudi semant transpar role semant transpar visual word recognit compound word megastudi approach previous studi visual word recognit compound word provid evid influenc lexic properti length frequenc semant transpar degre related mean compound word constitu morpholog process extent doorbel influenc door bell number question domain difficult address methodolog resourc unresolv collect semant transpar score compound word constitu level strong mean compound word relat constitu analyz effect speed pronunci lexic decis perform compound word english lexicon project httpelexiconwustl data result task human judg semant transpar rate constitu play signific role compound word process addit analys human judg semant transpar score constitu level account varianc compound word recognit perform word semant transpar score corpus base semant distanc score",0

"KeywordsSpeeded word fragment completion task Lexical decision task Semantic priming ","using the speeded word fragment completion task to examine semantic priming","The present research investigates semantic priming with an adapted version of the word fragment completion task. In this task, which we refer to as the speeded word fragment completion task, participants need to complete words such as lett_ce (lettuce), from which one letter was omitted, as quickly as possible. This paradigm has some interesting qualities in comparison with the traditionally used lexical decision task. That is, it requires no pseudowords, it is more engaging for participants, and most importantly, it allows for a more fine-grained investigation of semantic activation. In two studies, we found that words were completed faster when the preceding trial comprised a semantically related fragment such as tom_to (tomato) than when it comprised an unrelated fragment such as guit_r (guitar). A third experiment involved a lexical decision task, to compare both paradigms. The results showed that the magnitude of the priming effect was similar, but item-level priming effects were inconsistent over tasks. Crucially, the speeded word fragment completion task obtained strong priming effects for highly frequent, central words, such as work, money, and warm, whereas the lexical decision task did not. In a final experiment featuring only short, highly frequent words, the lexical decision task failed to find a priming effect, whereas the fragment completion task did obtain a robust effect. Taken together, these results suggest that the speeded word fragment completion task may prove a viable alternative for examining semantic priming.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"No","speed word fragment complet task lexic decis task semant prime speed word fragment complet task examin semant prime present research investig semant prime adapt version word fragment complet task task refer speed word fragment complet task particip complet word lettc lettuc letter omit quick paradigm interest qualiti comparison tradit lexic decis task requir pseudoword engag particip import fine grain investig semant activ studi found word complet faster preced trial compris semant relat fragment tomto tomato compris unrel fragment guitr guitar experi involv lexic decis task compar paradigm result show magnitud prime effect similar item level prime effect inconsist task crucial speed word fragment complet task obtain strong prime effect high frequent central word work money warm lexic decis task final experi featur short high frequent word lexic decis task fail find prime effect fragment complet task obtain robust effect result suggest speed word fragment complet task prove viabl altern examin semant prime",0

We assessed task equivalence by administering both sets of measures to 47 bilingual Mandarin-English speakers. Interpretation bias measurement was similar and reliable across language versions, confirming suitability of the Mandarin versions for future cross-cultural research. By contrast, scores on attention bias tasks did not intercorrelate reliably, suggesting that nonverbal stimuli such as pictures or facial expressions of emotion might present better prospects for cross-cultural comparison.

Ratings are reported for each face separately. Further analyses showed that the age groups differed in their ratings of young and old faces. On average, old participants evaluated the faces as more positive (i.e., more attractive, more energetic) than did young participants. In line with research on a negative aging stereotype, old faces were judged as less positive than young faces.

"KeywordsSocial Anxiety Difference Score Discrepancy Effect Residual Difference Simple Difference ","testing discrepancy effects a critique a suggestion and an illustration","To assess the effects of discrepancy between two independent variables, investigators sometimes compute difference scores and correlate such scores with a criterion variable. However, the correlation of the difference with the criterion is accounted for by the correlations of the difference constituents with the criterion and the constituents’ variances. It follows that when investigators are testing a prediction that is not captured by the difference constituents’ main effects, using the difference correlation analysis may be misleading. Under these circumstances, the effects of a discrepancy between two independent variables can be assessed by a test of their interaction. The problems inherent in using difference scores and the advantage of testing the interaction are illustrated in relation to research programs on two separate topics in social psychology.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",2002,"No","social anxieti differ score discrep effect residu differ simpl differ test discrep effect critiqu suggest illustr assess effect discrep independ variabl investig comput differ score correl score criterion variabl correl differ criterion account correl differ constitu criterion constitu varianc investig test predict captur differ constitu main effect differ correl analysi mislead circumst effect discrep independ variabl assess test interact problem inher differ score advantag test interact illustr relat research program separ topic social psycholog",0

Statistically significant main effects were found for task type—steeper discounting was observed in the binary-choice task— but not for mode of administration. As simple evidence of validity, hyperbolic curves consistently provided a better fit to the data than did exponential curves for both tasks. Further, magnitude effects were also observed across conditions. Correlational results varied largely as a function of the discounting index (either k or area under the curve) under consideration. Across the two tasks, discounting indices showed modest levels of reliability [r(AUC)=.33; r(k)=.75].

In Experiment 1, we used a within-subjects manipulation of video contexts and compared the effects of reinstatement of a global context (15 words per context) with effects of less overloaded context cues (1 and 3 words per context) on recall. The size of the reinstatement effects in Experiment 1 show how potently video contexts can cue recall. A strong effect of cue overload was also found; reinstatement effects were smaller, but still quite robust, in the 15 words per context condition. The powerful reinstatement effect was replicated for local contexts in Experiment 2, which included a nocontexts-reinstated group, a control condition used to determine whether reinstatement of half of the cues caused biased output interference for uncued targets.

This screening effect introduces confounds in experiments whose very hypotheses are focused on comparing anatomical differences in subjects who differ, for example, in their reactions to anxiety-inducing situations.

RADIANCE (Ward, 1994), however, is freely available and popular in the visual perception community, making it a prime candidate. We have shown previously that RADIANCE’S simulation accuracy is greatly improved when color is coded by spectra, rather than by the originally envisaged RGB triplets (Ruppertsberg & Bloj, 2006). Here, we present a method for spectral rendering with RADIANCE to generate hyperspectral images that can be converted to XYZ images (CIE 1931 system) and then to machine-dependent RGB images.

In Experiment 1, during study, one group of subjects generated a command name in response to each pair; a second group generated a goal statement describing the goal to be accomplished in addition to generating a command name. During recall, half of each group was required to recall the name, whereas the other half was required to describe the goal before attempting to recall the name. In Experiment 2, during study, command names (and goals for those subjects in the goal condition) were imposed by the experimenter rather than generated by the subject. Subjects who generated goals and names recalled more command names than did those who generated only names or who received imposed goals and/or names. Generation of an appropriate goal at study improved encoding by helping subjects to select more appropriate command names; generation of an appropriate goal at test improved retrieval for appropriate names only, presumably by activating a relevant subset of names.

Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that standard statistical techniques applied to ad’ analysis can lead to large numbers of Type I errors (incorrectly rejecting a hypothesis of no difference). Various statistical methods were compared in terms of their Type I and Type II error (incorrectly accepting a hypothesis of no difference) rates. Our conclusions are the same whether these two types of errors are weighted equally or Type I errors are weighted more heavily. The most promising method is to combine an aggregated’ measure with a percentile bootstrap confidence interval, a computerintensive nonparametric method of statistical inference. Researchers who prefer statistical techniques more commonly used in psychology, such as a repeated measurest test, should useγ (Goodman & Kruskal, 1954), since it performs slightly better than or nearly as well asd’. In general, when repeated measurest tests are used,γ is more conservative thand’: It makes more Type II errors, but its Type I error rate tends to be much closer to that of the traditional .05 α level.

Estimation can be performed using either the standard continuous maximum likelihood (CML) method or quantile maximum probability (QMP; Heathcote & Brown, in press). We review the properties of each distribution and the theoretical evidence showing that CML estimates fail for some cases with shifted distributions, whereas QMP estimates do not. In cases in which CML does not fail, a Monte Carlo investigation showed that QMP estimates were usually as good, and in some cases better, than CML estimates. However, the Monte Carlo study also uncovered problems that can occur with both CML and QMP estimates, particularly when samples are small and skew is low, highlighting the difficulties of estimating distributions with parameter-dependent lower bounds.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",2004,"No","weibul distribut skew distribut royal statist societi mont carlo studi shift paramet qmpe estim lognorm wald weibul rt distribut paramet depend lower bound describ test quantil maximum probabl estim qmpe open sourc ansi fortran program respons time distribut estim qmpe enabl user estim paramet gaussian gumbel distribut shift distribut distribut paramet depend lower bound lognorm wald weibul distribut estim perform standard continu maximum likelihood cml method quantil maximum probabl qmp heathcot brown press review properti distribut theoret evid show cml estim fail case shift distribut qmp estim case cml fail mont carlo investig show qmp estim good case cml estim mont carlo studi uncov problem occur cml qmp estim sampl small skew low highlight difficulti estim distribut paramet depend lower bound",0

Participants trained on SF or RSF for 10 sets of eight 3-min practice trials and two 3-min test trials. They then took tests involving retention, resistance to secondary task interference, and transfer to a different control system. They then switched from SF to RSF or from RSF to SF for 2 sets of final tests and completed rating scales comparing RSF and SF. Slight differences were predicted on the basis of a scoring error in the original version of SF used and on slightly more precise joystick control in RSF. The predictions were supported. The SF group started better but did worse when they transferred to RSF. Despite the disadvantage of having to be cautious in generalizing from RSF to SF, we conclude that RSF has many advantages, which include accommodating new PC hardware and new training techniques.

"KeywordsTechnical Standard Performance Standard Behavior Research Method Scientific Merit Student Orientation ","technical standards and performance standards in the pursuit of quality","The concept of standards lacks clarity because it is applied both to concrete specifications and to the assessment of quality. Confusion is reduced by introducing the notion of interchange expectancy. distinguishing transfer, coupling, and market success as components. Transfer expectancy depends upon the products to be transported or exchanged, but when there is a need to estimate transfer expectancy, a combination of technical standards and performance standards must be applied. Though performance standards are intended to produce quality, the quality of the instrumentation to measure performance standards is often neglected. The development of high-quality performance standards first requires the delineation of the relevant dimensions of performance quality. The process of giving precision to performance standards may lead to the emergence of more acceptable technical standards. To illustrate some of these points, data is presented from the CONDUIT system for quality evaluation of computer-based curriculum materials. The performance quality of these products includes the dimension of transfer expectancy, as well as educational and scientific merit.

Thus, each S in the pair serves as a yoked control for the other, in reciprocal relation to the two CSs used. In addition to eliminating inadvertent confounding stemming from individual differences in sensitization and responsiveness, the reciprocal yoked control design also provides a single-session method for identifying Ss who are equally classically conditionable, so that instrumental-classical comparisons can be made free of bias from differences in classical conditionability.

Clinical categories of body types were used as prototypes. By comparing the subjective appearance of a person’s body with prototypes, we can understand how different attributes of his or her body shape contribute to perception of body size. After lifelike random distortions have been applied to parts of their body image, individuals adjust their body shapes until they converge on their perceived veridical appearance. Exaggeration and minimization of particular body areas measured with respect to their true shape and with different prototypes can be expressed as numerical deviations. In this way, perceived body size and body attractiveness can be appraised during the course of diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",1999,"No","bodi imag anorexia nervosa bodi part eat disord bodi shape comput graphic techniqu studi bodi size percept bodi type present approach measur bodi size estim normal eat disord women men clinic categori bodi type prototyp compar subject appear person bodi prototyp understand attribut bodi shape contribut percept bodi size lifelik random distort appli part bodi imag individu adjust bodi shape converg perceiv verid appear exagger minim bodi area measur respect true shape prototyp express numer deviat perceiv bodi size bodi attract apprais diagnosi treatment eat disord",0

Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide SPSS and SAS macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986).

This task has almost always been applied individually, and stimuli presentation is controlled by the experimenter. Recently, De Neys, d’Ydewalle, Schaeken, and Vos (2002) improved the administration procedure by designing an automated, group-administrable version of the task (GOSPAN). They found GOSPAN to be reliable, and they also provided evidence on its validity (a significant positive correlation between GOSPAN and OSPAN scores). However, an external test of GOSPAN validity is still lacking. In this work, we present such a validation for the automated version, when the task is administered both individually (Experiment 1) and to groups (Experiment 2). There are abundant previous data on the relation between working memory capacity and reading comprehension. In this work, this relation is studied using an automated OSPAN version to measure working memory capacity.

Although individualistic approaches have frequently been applied to analyze social processes, these are not generally concerned with dyadic relations, nor do they deal with dependency. This article describes a mathematical procedure for analyzing dyadic interactions in a social system. The proposed method consists mainly of decomposing asymmetric data into their symmetric and skew-symmetric parts. A quantification of skew symmetry for a social system can be obtained by dividing the norm of the skew-symmetric matrix by the norm of the asymmetric matrix. This calculation makes available to researchers a quantity related to the amount of dyadic reciprocity. With regard to agents, the procedure enables researchers to identify those whose behavior is asymmetric with respect to all agents. It is also possible to derive symmetric measurements among agents and to use multivariate statistical techniques.","Behavior Research Methods",2006,"No","partner effect social research general reciproc dyadic relat social interact behavior quantifi social asymmetr structur social phenomena involv set dyadic relat agent action depend individualist approach frequent appli analyz social process general concern dyadic relat deal depend articl describ mathemat procedur analyz dyadic interact social system propos method consist decompos asymmetr data symmetr skew symmetr part quantif skew symmetri social system obtain divid norm skew symmetr matrix norm asymmetr matrix calcul make research quantiti relat amount dyadic reciproc regard agent procedur enabl research identifi behavior asymmetr respect agent deriv symmetr measur agent multivari statist techniqu",0

In the present experiment, Monte Carlo techniques were used to compare psychometric thresholds obtained using six methods. Three psychometric functions were simulated using Naka-Rushton and Weibull functions and a probit/logit function combination. Thresholds were estimated using probit, logit, and normit analyses and least-squares regressions of untransformed orz-score and logit-transformed probabilities versus stimulus strength. Histograms were derived from 100 thresholds using each of the six methods for various sampling strategies of each psychometric function. Thresholds from probit, logit, and normit analyses were remarkably similar. Thresholds fromz-score- and logit-transformed regressions were more variable, and linear regression produced biased threshold estimates under some circumstances. Considering the similarity of thresholds, the speed of computation, and the ease of implementation, logit and normit analyses provide effective alternatives to the current “gold standard”—probit analysis—for the estimation of psychometric thresholds.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",1995,"No","logit regress psychometr function probit analysi threshold estim lower graph comparison method estim threshold psychometr function way estim threshold psychometr function relationship estim present experi mont carlo techniqu compar psychometr threshold obtain method psychometr function simul naka rushton weibul function probitlogit function combin threshold estim probit logit normit analys squar regress untransform orz score logit transform probabl versus stimulus strength histogram deriv threshold method sampl strategi psychometr function threshold probit logit normit analys remark similar threshold fromz score logit transform regress variabl linear regress produc bias threshold estim circumst similar threshold speed comput eas implement logit normit analys provid effect altern current gold standard probit analysi estim psychometr threshold",0

"KeywordsCultural consensus theory Implicit memory Finite mixture modeling ","adapting cultural mixture modeling for continuous measures of knowledge and memory fluency","Previous research (e.g., cultural consensus theory (Romney, Weller, & Batchelder, American Anthropologist, 88, 313–338, 1986); cultural mixture modeling (Mueller & Veinott, 2008)) has used overt response patterns (i.e., responses to questionnaires and surveys) to identify whether a group shares a single coherent attitude or belief set. Yet many domains in social science have focused on implicit attitudes that are not apparent in overt responses but still may be detected via response time patterns. We propose a method for modeling response times as a mixture of Gaussians, adapting the strong-consensus model of cultural mixture modeling to model this implicit measure of knowledge strength. We report the results of two behavioral experiments and one simulation experiment that establish the usefulness of the approach, as well as some of the boundary conditions under which distinct groups of shared agreement might be recovered, even when the group identity is not known. The results reveal that the ability to recover and identify shared-belief groups depends on (1) the level of noise in the measurement, (2) the differential signals for strong versus weak attitudes, and (3) the similarity between group attitudes. Consequently, the method shows promise for identifying latent groups among a population whose overt attitudes do not differ, but whose implicit or covert attitudes or knowledge may differ.","Behavior Research Methods",2016,"No","cultur consensus theori implicit memori finit mixtur model adapt cultur mixtur model continu measur knowledg memori fluenci previous research cultur consensus theori romney weller batcheld american anthropologist cultur mixtur model mueller veinott overt respons pattern respons questionnair survey identifi group share singl coher attitud belief set domain social scienc focus implicit attitud appar overt respons detect respons time pattern propos method model respons time mixtur gaussian adapt strong consensus model cultur mixtur model model implicit measur knowledg strength report result behavior experi simul experi establish use approach boundari condit distinct group share agreement recov group ident result reveal abil recov identifi share belief group depend level nois measur differenti signal strong versus weak attitud similar group attitud method show promis identifi latent group popul overt attitud differ implicit covert attitud knowledg differ",0
"KeywordsSemantic space model Vector space model Semantic memory Lexical co-occurrence Stop lists Closed-class words Morphological decomposition Part of speech tagging Word stemming ","performance impact of stop lists and morphological decomposition on wordword corpus based semantic space models","Corpus-based semantic space models, which primarily rely on lexical co-occurrence statistics, have proven effective in modeling and predicting human behavior in a number of experimental paradigms that explore semantic memory representation. The most widely studied extant models, however, are strongly influenced by orthographic word frequency (e.g., Shaoul & Westbury, Behavior Research Methods, 38, 190–195, 2006). This has the implication that high-frequency closed-class words can potentially bias co-occurrence statistics. Because these closed-class words are purported to carry primarily syntactic, rather than semantic, information, the performance of corpus-based semantic space models may be improved by excluding closed-class words (using stop lists) from co-occurrence statistics, while retaining their syntactic information through other means (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and/or affixes from inflected word forms). Additionally, very little work has been done to explore the effect of employing morphological decomposition on the inflected forms of words in corpora prior to compiling co-occurrence statistics, despite (controversial) evidence that humans perform early morphological decomposition in semantic processing. In this study, we explored the impact of these factors on corpus-based semantic space models. From this study, morphological decomposition appears to significantly improve performance in word–word co-occurrence semantic space models, providing some support for the claim that sublexical information—specifically, word morphology—plays a role in lexical semantic processing. An overall decrease in performance was observed in models employing stop lists (e.g., excluding closed-class words). Furthermore, we found some evidence that weakens the claim that closed-class words supply primarily syntactic information in word–word co-occurrence semantic space models.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"No","semant space model vector space model semant memori lexic occurr stop list close class word morpholog decomposit part speech tag word stem perform impact stop list morpholog decomposit wordword corpus base semant space model corpus base semant space model primarili reli lexic occurr statist proven effect model predict human behavior number experiment paradigm explor semant memori represent wide studi extant model strong influenc orthograph word frequenc shaoul westburi behavior research method implic high frequenc close class word potenti bias occurr statist close class word purport carri primarili syntact semant inform perform corpus base semant space model improv exclud close class word stop list occurr statist retain syntact inform mean part speech tag affix inflect word form addit work explor effect employ morpholog decomposit inflect form word corpora prior compil occurr statist controversi evid human perform earli morpholog decomposit semant process studi explor impact factor corpus base semant space model studi morpholog decomposit appear signific improv perform word word occurr semant space model provid support claim sublex inform specif word morpholog play role lexic semant process decreas perform observ model employ stop list exclud close class word found evid weaken claim close class word suppli primarili syntact inform word word occurr semant space model",0
"KeywordsSimilarity Seating Aggregation Intergroup bias Software ","advances in examining preferences for similarity in seating revisiting the aggregation index","Past research finds that people prefer to sit next to others who are similar to them in a variety of dimensions such as race, sex, and physical appearance. This preference for similarity in seating arrangements is called aggregation and is most commonly measured with the aggregation index (Campbell, Kruskal, & Wallace, Sociometry 29, 1–15, 1966). The aggregation index compares the observed dissimilarity in seating with the amount of dissimilarity that would be expected if seats were chosen randomly. However, the current closed-form equations for this method limit the ease, flexibility, and inferences that researchers have. This paper presents a new approach for studying aggregation that uses bootstrapped resampling of the seating environment to estimate the aggregation index parameters. This method, compiled as an executable program, SocialAggregation, reads a seating chart matrix provided by the researcher and automatically computes the observed number of dissimilar adjacencies, and simulates random seating preferences. The current method’s estimates not only converge with those of the original method, but it also handles a wider variety of situations and also allows for more precise hypothesis testing by directly modeling the distribution of the seating arrangements. Developing a better measure of aggregation opens new possibilities for understanding intergroup biases, and allows researchers to examine aggregation more efficiently.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"No","similar seat aggreg intergroup bias softwar advanc examin prefer similar seat revisit aggreg index past research find peopl prefer sit similar varieti dimens race sex physic appear prefer similar seat arrang call aggreg common measur aggreg index campbel kruskal wallac sociometri aggreg index compar observ dissimilar seat amount dissimilar expect seat chosen random current close form equat method limit eas flexibl infer research paper present approach studi aggreg bootstrap resampl seat environ estim aggreg index paramet method compil execut program socialaggreg read seat chart matrix provid research automat comput observ number dissimilar adjac simul random seat prefer current method estim converg origin method handl wider varieti situat precis hypothesi test direct model distribut seat arrang develop measur aggreg open possibl understand intergroup bias research examin aggreg effici",0

"KeywordsColor vision Tablet computer Games CCT Trivector test Repeatability iPad ","normative values for a tablet computer based application to assess chromatic contrast sensitivity","Tablet computer displays are amenable for the development of vision tests in a portable form. Assessing color vision using an easily accessible and portable test may help in the self-monitoring of vision-related changes in ocular/systemic conditions and assist in the early detection of disease processes. Tablet computer-based games were developed with different levels of gamification as a more portable option to assess chromatic contrast sensitivity. Game 1 was designed as a clinical version with no gaming elements. Game 2 was a gamified version of game 1 (added fun elements: feedback, scores, and sounds) and game 3 was a complete game with vision task nested within. The current study aimed to determine the normative values and evaluate repeatability of the tablet computer-based games in comparison with an established test, the Cambridge Colour Test (CCT) Trivector test. Normally sighted individuals [N = 100, median (range) age 19.0 years (18–56 years)] had their chromatic contrast sensitivity evaluated binocularly using the three games and the CCT. Games 1 and 2 and the CCT showed similar absolute thresholds and tolerance intervals, and game 3 had significantly lower values than games 1, 2, and the CCT, due to visual task differences. With the exception of game 3 for blue-yellow, the CCT and tablet computer-based games showed similar repeatability with comparable 95% limits of agreement. The custom-designed games are portable, rapid, and may find application in routine clinical practice, especially for testing younger populations.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","color vision tablet comput game cct trivector test repeat ipad normat valu tablet comput base applic assess chromat contrast sensit tablet comput display amen develop vision test portabl form assess color vision easili access portabl test monitor vision relat ocularsystem condit assist earli detect diseas process tablet comput base game develop level gamif portabl option assess chromat contrast sensit game design clinic version game element game gamifi version game ad fun element feedback score sound game complet game vision task nest current studi aim determin normat valu evalu repeat tablet comput base game comparison establish test cambridg colour test cct trivector test sight individu median rang age year year chromat contrast sensit evalu binocular game cct game cct show similar absolut threshold toler interv game signific lower valu game cct due visual task differ except game blue yellow cct tablet comput base game show similar repeat compar limit agreement custom design game portabl rapid find applic routin clinic practic test younger popul",0

This research primarily uses the Life Events Inventory (LEI), listing possible experiences that could have happened during childhood (Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 3, 208–214, 1996). Although imagination inflation research has spawned more than 50 investigations, no normative ratings exist on individual items contained in the LEI. To address this, we present descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, confidence interval) for 124 LEI items on occurrence (how likely is it that this experience happened to you), plausibility (how plausible is it that this event could have happened to someone), and desirability (how desirable is this experience). Occurrence and plausibility showed similar patterns of mean item ratings and were highly correlated, whereas desirability was moderately correlated with plausibility and unrelated to occurrence. These data should facilitate a more informed selection of specific LEI items to use in further research and can assist in clarifying the contributions of normative occurrence, plausibility, and desirability to imagination inflation effects.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"No","imagin inflat lei autobiograph memori life stori occurr plausibl desir life event inventori item imagin inflat imagin elabor childhood experi inflat increas particip estim event occur pre post manipul rate research primarili life event inventori lei list experi happen childhood garri man loftus sherman psychonom bulletin review imagin inflat research spawn investig normat rate exist individu item contain lei address present descript statist median standard deviat confid interv lei item occurr experi happen plausibl plausibl event happen desir desir experi occurr plausibl show similar pattern item rate high correl desir moder correl plausibl unrel occurr data facilit inform select specif lei item research assist clarifi contribut normat occurr plausibl desir imagin inflat effect",0

Unfortunately, it can be difficult to confidently acquire a sample that matches a given demographic, psychographic, or behavioral dimension. This problem exists because little information is known about individual participants and because some participants are motivated to misrepresent their identity with the goal of financial reward. Despite the fact that online workers do not typically display a greater than average level of dishonesty, when researchers overtly request that only a certain population take part in an online study, a nontrivial portion misrepresent their identity. In this study, a proposed system is tested that researchers can use to quickly, fairly, and easily screen participants on any dimension. In contrast to an overt request, the reported system results in significantly fewer (near zero) instances of participant misrepresentation. Tests for misrepresentations were conducted by using a large database of past participant records (~45,000 unique workers).

Despite general excitement about big data and naturally occurring datasets among researchers, three “gaps” stand in the way of their wider adoption in theory-driven research: the imagination gap, the skills gap, and the culture gap. We outline an approach to bridging these three gaps while respecting our responsibilities to the public as participants in and consumers of the resulting research. To that end, we introduce Data on the Mind (http://www.dataonthemind.org), a community-focused initiative aimed at meeting the unprecedented challenges and opportunities of theory-driven research with big data and naturally occurring datasets. We argue that big data and naturally occurring datasets are most powerfully used to supplement—not supplant—traditional experimental paradigms in order to understand human behavior and cognition, and we highlight emerging ethical issues related to the collection, sharing, and use of these powerful datasets.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","big data natur occur dataset open scienc onlin experi data mind find trace behavior cognit process big data natur occur dataset today peopl generat store data interact real virtual environ digit trace behavior cognit offer cognit scientist psychologist unpreced opportun test theori laboratori general excit big data natur occur dataset research gap stand wider adopt theori driven research imagin gap skill gap cultur gap outlin approach bridg gap respect respons public particip consum result research end introduc data mind httpwwwdataonthemindorg communiti focus initi aim meet unpreced challeng opportun theori driven research big data natur occur dataset argu big data natur occur dataset power supplement supplant tradit experiment paradigm order understand human behavior cognit highlight emerg ethic issu relat collect share power dataset",0

In results based on data collected from 186 university students, the entropy of the R-ASCM mostly loads the first principal component extracted from the CFIT subtests and shows a corresponding strong relationship with the item difficulty of the R-ASCM.

To estimate the parameters of both models, the program uses a CML approach. The model parameters can also be estimated with a MML approach that can be implemented in PROC NLMIXED of SAS Version 8. Both the MIRID CML program and the MML SAS approach are explained and compared in a simulation study. The results showed that they did about equally well in estimating the values of the item parameters but that there were some differences in the estimation of the person parameters, as could be expected from the differential assumptions regarding the distribution of the persons.

"KeywordsImageability Linguistics Cross-linguistic Correlations ","imageability ratings across languages","Imageability is a psycholinguistic variable that indicates how well a word gives rise to a mental image or sensory experience. Imageability ratings are used extensively in psycholinguistic, neuropsychological, and aphasiological studies. However, little formal knowledge exists about whether and how these ratings are associated between and within languages. Fifteen imageability databases were cross-correlated using nonparametric statistics. Some of these corresponded to unpublished data collected within a European research network—the Collaboration of Aphasia Trialists (COST IS1208). All but four of the correlations were significant. The average strength of the correlations (rho = .68) and the variance explained (R 2 = 46%) were moderate. This implies that factors other than imageability may explain 54% of the results. Imageability ratings often correlate across languages. Different possibly interacting factors may explain the moderate strength and variance explained in the correlations: (1) linguistic and cultural factors; (2) intrinsic differences between the databases; (3) range effects; (4) small numbers of words in each database, equivalent words, and participants; and (5) mean age of the participants. The results suggest that imageability ratings may be used cross-linguistically. However, further understanding of the factors explaining the variance in the correlations will be needed before research and practical recommendations can be made.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","imag linguist cross linguist correl imag rate languag imag psycholinguist variabl word rise mental imag sensori experi imag rate extens psycholinguist neuropsycholog aphasiolog studi formal knowledg exist rate languag fifteen imag databas cross correl nonparametr statist correspond unpublish data collect european research network collabor aphasia trialist cost is correl signific averag strength correl rho varianc explain moder impli factor imag explain result imag rate correl languag possibl interact factor explain moder strength varianc explain correl linguist cultur factor intrins differ databas rang effect small number word databas equival word particip age particip result suggest imag rate cross linguist understand factor explain varianc correl need research practic recommend made",0

The emotional transformations can be applied to any audio file, but can also run in real time, using live input from a microphone, with less than 20-ms latency. We anticipate that this tool will be useful for the study of emotions in psychology and neuroscience, because it enables a high level of control over the acoustical and emotional content of experimental stimuli in a variety of laboratory situations, including real-time social situations. We present here results of a series of validation experiments aiming to position the tool against several methodological requirements: that transformed emotions be recognized at above-chance levels, valid in several languages (French, English, Swedish, and Japanese) and with a naturalness comparable to natural speech.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","emot transform nonverb behavior voic real time softwar infra segment cue david open sourc platform real time transform infra segment emot cue run speech present open sourc softwar platform transform emot cue express speech signal audio effect pitch shift inflect vibrato filter emot transform appli audio file run real time live input microphon ms latenc anticip tool studi emot psycholog neurosci enabl high level control acoust emot content experiment stimuli varieti laboratori situat includ real time social situat present result seri valid experi aim posit tool methodolog requir transform emot recogn chanc level valid languag french english swedish japanes natur compar natur speech",0
"KeywordsPhonagnosia Voice recognition Individual differences Developmental disorders ","the glasgow voice memory test assessing the ability to memorize and recognize unfamiliar voices","One thousand one hundred and twenty subjects as well as a developmental phonagnosic subject (KH) along with age-matched controls performed the Glasgow Voice Memory Test, which assesses the ability to encode and immediately recognize, through an old/new judgment, both unfamiliar voices (delivered as vowels, making language requirements minimal) and bell sounds. The inclusion of non-vocal stimuli allows the detection of significant dissociations between the two categories (vocal vs. non-vocal stimuli). The distributions of accuracy and sensitivity scores (d’) reflected a wide range of individual differences in voice recognition performance in the population. As expected, KH showed a dissociation between the recognition of voices and bell sounds, her performance being significantly poorer than matched controls for voices but not for bells. By providing normative data of a large sample and by testing a developmental phonagnosic subject, we demonstrated that the Glasgow Voice Memory Test, available online and accessible from all over the world, can be a valid screening tool (~5 min) for a preliminary detection of potential cases of phonagnosia and of “super recognizers” for voices.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","phonagnosia voic recognit individu differ development disord glasgow voic memori test assess abil memor recogn unfamiliar voic thousand hundr twenti subject development phonagnos subject kh age match control perform glasgow voic memori test assess abil encod immedi recogn judgment unfamiliar voic deliv vowel make languag requir minim bell sound inclus vocal stimuli detect signific dissoci categori vocal vocal stimuli distribut accuraci sensit score reflect wide rang individu differ voic recognit perform popul expect kh show dissoci recognit voic bell sound perform signific poorer match control voic bell provid normat data larg sampl test development phonagnos subject demonstr glasgow voic memori test onlin access world valid screen tool min preliminari detect potenti case phonagnosia super recogn voic",0

For every noun–verb pair (72 pairs per subject), we assessed the semantic distance between the noun and the verb, using latent semantic analysis (LSA). Semantic distance was higher in the cued (""creative"") condition than the uncued condition, within subjects. Critically, between subjects, semantic distance in the cued condition had a strong relationship to a creativity factor derived from a battery of verbal, nonverbal, and achievement-based creativity measures (β= .50), and this relation remained when controlling for intelligence and personality.

A number of methods are available for collecting these data, but little effort has been made to compare their relative utility. In this article, we compare directly rated and five feature-based similarity data types in regard to their ability to be adequately represented by a spatial model (representational goodness of fit), and the ability of the representations to predict three external empirical variables (predictive validity). The results indicate that the representational goodness of fit of the feature-based similarities is noticeably superior to the directly rated similarities, and that the predictions of representations derived from common feature similarity data are substantially more likely than the predictions of all of the alternative representations.

The controller allows the selection of overlap, 200-msec gap, or remembered saccade trials. Size, maximal velocity, and reaction time are determined for each primary saccade. The number of prosaccades and antisaccades are counted. More saccades—for example, the occurrence and latency of corrective saccades—may be evaluated off line by an interactive PC analysis program. The eye position data can be transferred to a PC. Off-line analysis compares each observed variable relative to an age-matched control group (300 healthy control subjects 7–70 years of age, tested in the overlap condition with prosaccade instructions and in the gap condition with antisaccades). The diagnostic results can be used to elaborate an individual optomotor training program.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",2002,"No","attent deficit hyperact disord dyslexia experiment brain research attent deficit hyperact disord child saccad reaction time turn key transport eye track instrument clinic assess paper describ combin instrument eye tracker target generat head mount integr data analysi test paramet saccad eye movement fixat control give insight status function brain system minilas target generat project visual stimuli fixat point later stimuli programm time control select overlap msec gap rememb saccad trial size maxim veloc reaction time determin primari saccad number prosaccad antisaccad count saccad occurr latenc correct saccad evalu line interact pc analysi program eye posit data transfer pc line analysi compar observ variabl relat age match control group healthi control subject year age test overlap condit prosaccad instruct gap condit antisaccad diagnost result elabor individu optomotor train program",0
"KeywordsPermutation Test Exact Probability Effect Size Measure Usual Guideline Detect Group Difference ","detecting group differences in sequential association using sampled permutations log odds kappa and phi compared","When determining whether a particular transition is more characteristic of one group than of another, two things are required: an index associated with the transition of interest and a statistical test that can determine whether group membership systematically affects values for that index. Here the familiar parametrict test is compared with a test based on sampled permutations. Indices considered are the odds and log odds ratio, Yule’sQ, Wampold’s (1989) transformed kappa, and phi. The odds and log odds ratio are monotonically increasing functions of Yule’sQ and so give similar results. Yule’sQ and phi are essentially rank order invariant and usually give similar results. Transformed kappa, however, rank orders subjects somewhat differently than the others; moreover, it appears somewhat biased. With respect to the tests, when subjects are 20 or more it does not matter much whether sampled permutation or parametrict tests are used; both yield essentially the same result. However, when subjects are fewer than 20, or whenever there is any other reason to think that parametric assumptions may not be met, permutation tests are recommended. A computer program that effects such tests is described.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",1996,"No","permut test exact probabl effect size measur usual guidelin detect group differ detect group differ sequenti associ sampl permut log odd kappa phi compar determin transit characterist group thing requir index transit interest statist test determin group membership systemat affect valu index familiar parametrict test compar test base sampl permut indic consid odd log odd ratio yule sq wampold transform kappa phi odd log odd ratio monoton increas function yule sq give similar result yule sq phi essenti rank order invari give similar result transform kappa rank order subject differ appear bias respect test subject matter sampl permut parametrict test yield essenti result subject fewer reason parametr assumpt met permut test recommend comput program effect test",0

We show that parameter estimates from QML are asymptotically unbiased and normally distributed.

"KeywordsInput Image Discrete Fourier Transform Optical Gain Joint Photographic Expert Group Retinal Blood Vessel ","image processing for improved eye tracking accuracy","Video cameras provide a simple, noninvasive method for monitoring a subject’s eye movements. An important concept is that of the resolution of the system, which is the smallest eye movement that can be reliably detected. While hardware systems are available that estimate direction of gaze in real time from a video image of the pupil, such systems must limit image processing to attain real-time performance and are limited to a resolution of about 10 arc minutes. Two ways to improve resolution are discussed. The first is to improve the image processing algorithms that are used to derive an estimate. Offline analysis of the data can improve resolution by at least one order of magnitude for images of the pupil. A second avenue by which to improve resolution is to increase the optical gain of the imaging setup (i.e., the amount of image motion produced by a given eye rotation). Ophthalmoscopic imaging of retinal blood vessels provides increased optical gain and improved immunity to small head movements but requires a highly sensitive camera. The large number of images involved in a typical experiment imposes great demands on the storage, handling, and processing of data. A major bottleneck had been the real-time digitization and storage of large amounts of video imagery, but recent developments in video compression hardware have made this problem tractable at a reasonable cost. Images of both the retina and the pupil can be analyzed successfully using a basic toolbox of image-processing routines (filtering, correlation, thresholding, etc.), which are, for the most part, well suited to implementation on vectorizing supercomputers.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",1997,"No","input imag discret fourier transform optic gain joint photograph expert group retin blood vessel imag process improv eye track accuraci video camera provid simpl noninvas method monitor subject eye movement import concept resolut system smallest eye movement reliabl detect hardwar system estim direct gaze real time video imag pupil system limit imag process attain real time perform limit resolut arc minut way improv resolut discuss improv imag process algorithm deriv estim offlin analysi data improv resolut order magnitud imag pupil avenu improv resolut increas optic gain imag setup amount imag motion produc eye rotat ophthalmoscop imag retin blood vessel increas optic gain improv immun small head movement requir high sensit camera larg number imag involv typic experi impos great demand storag handl process data major bottleneck real time digit storag larg amount video imageri recent develop video compress hardwar made problem tractabl reason cost imag retina pupil analyz success basic toolbox imag process routin filter correl threshold part suit implement vector supercomput",0

As the available resolution of CRT screens increases, it becomes more difficult to measure and correct for this distortion. We present a simple, highly accurate method for determining the mapping between internal coordinates and the viewing plane. It requires that an observer, using a calibration program, adjust triples of displayed points until they are collinear. A metal straightedge placed between the observer and the screen aids in this judgment. We describe the calibration of an IBM Enhanced Graphics Display in high-resolution mode (350 × 640 pixels), and illustrate how to use the estimated mapping to choose internal coordinates to draw undistorted figures that are accurate to within 0.5 pixel. The method can be used to assess or to correct the accuracy of visual displays.

This is in contrast to maximizing some measure of scatter associated with the marginal distributions of the projected scores, which does not take into account the overall structure of the projected data. Included are comparisons in which distributions are not elliptically symmetric. One of the new methods simply removes outliers using a projection-type multivariate outlier detection method that has been found to perform well relative to other outlier detection methods that have been proposed.

The Psychology Experiment Authoring Kit (PEAK) is a novel spreadsheet-based interface allowing students and researchers with rudimentary spreadsheet skills to create cognitive and cognitive neuroscience experiments in minutes. Students fill in a spreadsheet listing of independent variables and stimuli, insert columns that represent experimental objects such as slides (presenting text, pictures, and sounds) and feedback displays to create complete experiments, all within a single spreadsheet. The application then executes experiments with centisecond precision. Formal usability testing was done in two stages: (1) detailed coding of 10 individual subjects in one-on-one experimenter/subject videotaped sessions and (2) classroom testing of 64 undergraduates. In both individual and classroom testing, the students learned to effectively use PEAK within 2 h, and were able to create a lexical decision experiment in under 10 min. Findings from the individual testing in Stage 1 resulted in significant changes to documentation and training materials and identification of bugs to be corrected. Stage 2 testing identified additional bugs to be corrected and new features to be considered to facilitate student understanding of the experiment model.

Pilot work prior to Study 1 led to the creation of a 95-item version (TIS-95). A principal components analysis of TIS-95 (n = 215) resulted in two dimensions that we rotated to a Varimax criterion and interpreted as (1) material change (e.g., “This event changed where I live”) and (2) psychological change (e.g., “This event changed the way I think about things”). TIS-95 was reduced to 25 items. In Study 2, the structure of TIS-25 was replicated (n = 531) using the same method. The best 12 items were retained.

As is common for a novel method, the exact methodological procedures employed in an individual study are still relatively idiosyncratic and the effects of different methodological setups on mouse-tracking measures have not been explored so far. Here, we study the impact of one commonly occurring methodological variation, namely whether participants have to initiate their mouse movements to trigger stimulus presentation (dynamic starting condition) or whether the stimulus is presented automatically after a fixed delay and participants can freely decide when to initiate their movements (static starting condition). We compared data from a previous study in which participants performed a mouse-tracking version of a Simon task with a dynamic starting condition to data from a new study that employed a static starting condition in an otherwise identical setup. Results showed reliable Simon effects and Congruency Sequence effects on response time (RT) and discrete trial-level mouse-tracking measures (i.e., average deviation) in both starting conditions. In contrast, within-trial continuous measures (i.e., extracted temporal segments) were weaker and occurred in a more temporally compressed way in the static compared to the dynamic starting condition. This was in line with generally less consistent movements within and across participants in the static compared to the dynamic condition. Our results suggest that studies that use within-trial continuous measures to assess dynamic aspects of mouse movements should apply dynamic starting procedures to enhance the leakage of cognitive processing into the mouse movements.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","mous track methodolog boundari condit simon task stuck start line start procedur influenc mous track data mous track increas popular method trace cognit process common method exact methodolog procedur employ individu studi idiosyncrat effect methodolog setup mous track measur explor studi impact common occur methodolog variat particip initi mous movement trigger stimulus present dynam start condit stimulus present automat fix delay particip freeli decid initi movement static start condit compar data previous studi particip perform mous track version simon task dynam start condit data studi employ static start condit ident setup result show reliabl simon effect congruenc sequenc effect respons time rt discret trial level mous track measur averag deviat start condit contrast trial continu measur extract tempor segment weaker occur tempor compress static compar dynam start condit line general consist movement particip static compar dynam condit result suggest studi trial continu measur assess dynam aspect mous movement appli dynam start procedur enhanc leakag cognit process mous movement",0

The theory predicts that reliance on gist mental representations (as opposed to verbatim) is more effective in reducing health risks and improving decision making. Technical information was translated into decision-relevant gist representations and gist principles (i.e., healthy values). The SKO was hypothesized to facilitate extracting these gist representations and principles by engaging women in dialogue, “understanding” their responses, and replying appropriately to prompt additional engagement. Participants were randomly assigned to either the obesity prevention tutorial (GistFit) or a control tutorial containing different content using the same technology. Participants were administered assessments of knowledge about nutrition and exercise, gist comprehension, gist principles, behavioral intentions and self-reported behavior. An analysis of engagement in tutorial dialogues and responses to multiple-choice questions to check understanding throughout the tutorial revealed significant correlations between these conversations and scores on subsequent knowledge tests and gist comprehension. Knowledge and comprehension measures correlated with healthier behavior and greater intentions to perform healthy behavior. Differences between GistFit and control tutorials were greater for participants who engaged more fully. Thus, results are consistent with the hypothesis that active engagement with a new gist-based ITS, rather than a passive memorization of verbatim details, was associated with an array of known psychosocial mediators of preventive health decisions, such as knowledge acquisition, and gist comprehension.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","fuzzi trace theori intellig tutor system gist health obes activ engag web base tutori prevent obes ground fuzzi trace theori predict higher knowledg gist comprehens sharabl knowledg object skos creat intellig tutor system ground fuzzi trace theori teach women obes prevent gistfit gist healthi eat exercis theori predict relianc gist mental represent oppos verbatim effect reduc health risk improv decis make technic inform translat decis relev gist represent gist principl healthi valu sko hypothes facilit extract gist represent principl engag women dialogu understand respons repli appropri prompt addit engag particip random assign obes prevent tutori gistfit control tutori content technolog particip administ assess knowledg nutrit exercis gist comprehens gist principl behavior intent report behavior analysi engag tutori dialogu respons multipl choic question check understand tutori reveal signific correl convers score subsequ knowledg test gist comprehens knowledg comprehens measur correl healthier behavior greater intent perform healthi behavior differ gistfit control tutori greater particip engag fulli result consist hypothesi activ engag gist base passiv memor verbatim detail array psychosoci mediat prevent health decis knowledg acquisit gist comprehens",0

However, researchers have argued that this research may have underestimated the size of the relationship because it relied primarily on the Marlowe–Crowne scale (MC; Crowne & Marlowe, Journal of Consulting Psychology, 24, 349–354, 1960), which loads primarily on the least relevant form of social desirable responding for this particular context, the moralistic bias.

The VVIQ correlated significantly with the Self-Deceptive Enhancement (SDE) and Agency Management (AM) BIDR subscales and with the MC. The largest correlation was with SDE. The ability of SDE to predict VVIQ scores was not significantly enhanced by adding either AM or MC. Correlations between the VVIQ and BIDR egoistic scales were larger when the BIDR was continuously rather than dichotomously scored.

This model traditionally includes two parameters that determine how a physical stimulus is transformed into a psychological magnitude: (1) an exponent that describes the compression or expansion of the physical signal into the relevant psychological scale (β), and (2) an estimate of the amount of inherent variability (often called internal noise) in the Gaussian activations along the psychological scale (σ). To date, linear slopes on log–log plots have traditionally been used to estimate β, and a completely separate method of averaging coefficients of variance has been used to estimate σ. We provide a respectful, yet critical, review of these traditional methods, and offer a tutorial on a maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) and a Bayesian estimation method for estimating both β and σ [PsiMLE(β,σ)], coupled with free software that researchers can use to implement it without a background in MLE or Bayesian statistics (R-PsiMLE).

Subjective differences and ambiguity of transparency make judgments difficult, and a computational alternative based on a general model might be a way to average across subjective differences. In the present study, we propose two approaches based on latent semantic analysis (Landauer & Dumais in Psychological Review 104:211–240, 1997): Model 1 compares the semantic similarity between a compound word and each of its constituents, and Model 2 derives the dominant meaning of a constituent from a clustering analysis of morphological family members (e.g., “butterfingers” or “buttermilk” for “butter”). The proposed models successfully predicted participants’ transparency ratings, and we recommend that experimenters use Model 1 for English compounds and Model 2 for Chinese compounds, on the basis of differences in raters’ morphological processing in the different writing systems. The dominance of lexical meaning, semantic transparency, and the average similarity between all pairs within a morphological family are provided, and practical applications for future studies are discussed.","Behavior Research Methods",2014,"No","semant transpar latent semant analysi chines compound word morpholog famili semant consist cluster predict rater transpar judgment english chines morpholog constitu latent semant analysi morpholog constitu english compound butter fli butterfli charact chines compound differ mean word subject differ ambigu transpar make judgment difficult comput altern base general model averag subject differ present studi propos approach base latent semant analysi landauer dumai psycholog review model compar semant similar compound word constitu model deriv domin mean constitu cluster analysi morpholog famili member butterfing buttermilk butter propos model success predict particip transpar rate recommend experiment model english compound model chines compound basi differ rater morpholog process write system domin lexic mean semant transpar averag similar pair morpholog famili provid practic applic futur studi discuss",0

To remedy this problem, we propose an extension of Mangat’s (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B, 56, 93–95, 1994) variant of the RRT that allows for determining whether participants respond truthfully.

We investigated performance on this test in 1,588 primary school children (Grades 1–6) and examined in each grade its associations with mathematics achievement. The SYMP Test had satisfactory test-retest reliability. The SYMP Test showed significant and stable correlations with mathematics achievement for both one-digit and two-digit comparison, across all grades. This replicates the previously observed association between symbolic numerical magnitude processing and mathematics achievement, but extends it by showing that the association is observed in all grades in primary education and occurs for single- as well as multi-digit processing. Children with mathematical learning difficulties performed significantly lower on one-digit comparison and two-digit comparison in all grades.

"KeywordsGaze-contingent display Artificial scotoma Scotoma validation Scotoma simulation ","a behavioral task for the validation of a gaze contingent simulated scotoma","Gaze-contingent displays provide a valuable method in visual research for controlling visual input and investigating its visual and cognitive processing. Although the body of research using gaze-contingent retinal stabilization techniques has grown considerably during the last decade, only few studies have been concerned with the reliability of the specific real-time simulations applied. Using a Landolt ring discrimination task, we present a behavioral validation of gaze-contingent central scotoma simulation in healthy observers. Importantly, behavioral testing is necessary to show whether the simulation impairs foveal processing of visual information. This test becomes even more crucial when researchers are faced with null results in a task performed with the scotoma, as compared with a control condition. It must be ruled out that the lack of behavioral effects results from a type II error caused by improper implementation before conclusions about foveal contributions to the given task may be drawn. In our experiment, the scotoma effectively prevented foveal processing of the visual stimuli, leading to significantly reduced response accuracies, as compared with unimpaired vision.

"KeywordsRandomized response Measurement model Sensitive questions Survey design Social desirability ","detecting nonadherence without loss in efficiency a simple extension of the crosswise model","In surveys concerning sensitive behavior or attitudes, respondents often do not answer truthfully, because of social desirability bias. To elicit more honest responding, the randomized-response (RR) technique aims at increasing perceived and actual anonymity by prompting respondents to answer with a randomly modified and thus uninformative response. In the crosswise model, as a particularly promising variant of the RR, this is achieved by adding a second, nonsensitive question and by prompting respondents to answer both questions jointly. Despite increased privacy protection and empirically higher prevalence estimates of socially undesirable behaviors, evidence also suggests that some respondents might still not adhere to the instructions, in turn leading to questionable results. Herein we propose an extension of the crosswise model (ECWM) that makes it possible to detect several types of response biases with adequate power in realistic sample sizes. Importantly, the ECWM allows for testing the validity of the model’s assumptions without any loss in statistical efficiency. Finally, we provide an empirical example supporting the usefulness of the ECWM.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","random respons measur model sensit question survey design social desir detect nonadher loss effici simpl extens crosswis model survey sensit behavior attitud respond answer truth social desir bias elicit honest respond random respons rr techniqu aim increas perceiv actual anonym prompt respond answer random modifi uninform respons crosswis model promis variant rr achiev ad nonsensit question prompt respond answer question joint increas privaci protect empir higher preval estim social undesir behavior evid suggest respond adher instruct turn lead question result propos extens crosswis model ecwm make detect type respons bias adequ power realist sampl size import ecwm test valid model assumpt loss statist effici final provid empir support use ecwm",0
"KeywordsBinocular coordination Eye movements Reading and nonreading tasks ","investigating eye movement acquisition and analysis technologies as a causal factor in differential prevalence of crossed and uncrossed fixation disparity during reading and dot scanning","Previous studies examining binocular coordination during reading have reported conflicting results in terms of the nature of disparity (e.g. Kliegl, Nuthmann, & Engbert (Journal of Experimental Psychology General 135:12-35, 2006); Liversedge, White, Findlay, & Rayner (Vision Research 46:2363-2374, 2006). One potential cause of this inconsistency is differences in acquisition devices and associated analysis technologies. We tested this by directly comparing binocular eye movement recordings made using SR Research EyeLink 1000 and the Fourward Technologies Inc. DPI binocular eye-tracking systems. Participants read sentences or scanned horizontal rows of dot strings; for each participant, half the data were recorded with the EyeLink, and the other half with the DPIs. The viewing conditions in both testing laboratories were set to be very similar. Monocular calibrations were used. The majority of fixations recorded using either system were aligned, although data from the EyeLink system showed greater disparity magnitudes. Critically, for unaligned fixations, the data from both systems showed a majority of uncrossed fixations. These results suggest that variability in previous reports of binocular fixation alignment is attributable to the specific viewing conditions associated with a particular experiment (variables such as luminance and viewing distance), rather than acquisition and analysis software and hardware.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"No","binocular coordin eye movement read nonread task investig eye movement acquisit analysi technolog causal factor differenti preval cross uncross fixat dispar read dot scan previous studi examin binocular coordin read report conflict result term natur dispar kliegl nuthmann engbert journal experiment psycholog general liversedg white findlay rayner vision research potenti inconsist differ acquisit devic analysi technolog test direct compar binocular eye movement record made sr research eyelink fourward technolog dpi binocular eye track system particip read sentenc scan horizont row dot string particip half data record eyelink half dpis view condit test laboratori set similar monocular calibr major fixat record system align data eyelink system show greater dispar magnitud critic unalign fixat data system show major uncross fixat result suggest variabl previous report binocular fixat align attribut specif view condit experi variabl lumin view distanc acquisit analysi softwar hardwar",0

BRCA Gist is an ITS developed using AutoTutor Lite, a Web-based version of AutoTutor. Fuzzy-trace theory theoretically motivated the development of BRCA Gist, which engages people in tutorial dialogues to teach them about genetic breast cancer risk. We describe an empirical method to create tutorial dialogues and fine-tune the calibration of BRCA Gist’s semantic processing engine without a team of computer scientists. We created five interactive dialogues centered on pedagogic questions such as “What should someone do if she receives a positive result for genetic risk of breast cancer?” This method involved an iterative refinement process of repeated testing with different texts and successively making adjustments to the tutor’s expectations and settings in order to improve performance. The goal of this method was to enable BRCA Gist to interpret and respond to answers in a manner that best facilitated learning. We developed a method to analyze the efficacy of the tutor’s dialogues. We found that BRCA Gist’s assessment of participants’ answers was highly correlated with the quality of the answers found by trained human judges using a reliable rubric. The dialogue quality between users and BRCA Gist predicted performance on a breast cancer risk knowledge test completed after exposure to the tutor. The appropriateness of BRCA Gist’s feedback also predicted the quality of answers and breast cancer risk knowledge test scores.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"No","intellig tutor system discours technolog auto tutor lite dialogu fuzzi trace theori develop analysi tutori dialogu autotutor lite goal intellig tutor system interact natur languag emul benefit train human tutor student interpret student answer appropri respond order encourag elabor brca gist develop autotutor lite web base version autotutor fuzzi trace theori theoret motiv develop brca gist engag peopl tutori dialogu teach genet breast cancer risk describ empir method creat tutori dialogu fine tune calibr brca gist semant process engin team comput scientist creat interact dialogu center pedagog question receiv posit result genet risk breast cancer method involv iter refin process repeat test text success make adjust tutor expect set order improv perform goal method enabl brca gist interpret respond answer manner facilit learn develop method analyz efficaci tutor dialogu found brca gist assess particip answer high correl qualiti answer found train human judg reliabl rubric dialogu qualiti user brca gist predict perform breast cancer risk knowledg test complet exposur tutor appropri brca gist feedback predict qualiti answer breast cancer risk knowledg test score",0
"KeywordsPower Mediation analysis Significance testing ","when the test of mediation is more powerful than the test of the total effect","Although previous research has studied power in mediation models, the extent to which the inclusion of a mediator will increase power has not been investigated. To address this deficit, in a first study we compared the analytical power values of the mediated effect and the total effect in a single-mediator model, to identify the situations in which the inclusion of one mediator increased statistical power. The results from this first study indicated that including a mediator increased statistical power in small samples with large coefficients and in large samples with small coefficients, and when coefficients were nonzero and equal across models. Next, we identified conditions under which power was greater for the test of the total mediated effect than for the test of the total effect in the parallel two-mediator model. These results indicated that including two mediators increased power in small samples with large coefficients and in large samples with small coefficients, the same pattern of results that had been found in the first study. Finally, we assessed the analytical power for a sequential (three-path) two-mediator model and compared the power to detect the three-path mediated effect to the power to detect both the test of the total effect and the test of the mediated effect for the single-mediator model. The results indicated that the three-path mediated effect had more power than the mediated effect from the single-mediator model and the test of the total effect.

Using 11 h of transcribed utterances from informal, fluid, colocated workgroup meetings, we compared the associations of this metric with coded equality of participation and standard deviation. While coded participation and our metric had similar patterns of findings, standard deviation had a somewhat different pattern, suggesting that it might lead to incorrect assessments with fluid teams. Exploratory analyses suggest that, as compared with mixed-age/status groups, groups of younger faculty had more equal participation and that the presence of negative affect words was associated with more dominated participation.

"KeywordsEye tracking Pupil size Low cost ","comparing eye trackers by correlating their eye metric data","Up to now, the potential of eye tracking in science as well as in everyday life has not been fully realized because of the high acquisition cost of trackers. Recently, manufacturers have introduced low-cost devices, preparing the way for wider use of this underutilized technology. As soon as scientists show independently of the manufacturers that low-cost devices are accurate enough for application and research, the real advent of eye trackers will have arrived. To facilitate this development, we propose a simple approach for comparing two eye trackers by adopting a method that psychologists have been practicing in diagnostics for decades: correlating constructs to show reliability and validity. In a laboratory study, we ran the newer, low-cost EyeTribe eye tracker and an established SensoMotoric Instruments eye tracker at the same time, positioning one above the other. This design allowed us to directly correlate the eye-tracking metrics of the two devices over time. The experiment was embedded in a research project on memory where 26 participants viewed pictures or words and had to make cognitive judgments afterwards. The outputs of both trackers, that is, the pupil size and point of regard, were highly correlated, as estimated in a mixed effects model. Furthermore, calibration quality explained a substantial amount of individual differences for gaze, but not pupil size. Since data quality is not compromised, we conclude that low-cost eye trackers, in many cases, may be reliable alternatives to established devices.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","eye track pupil size low cost compar eye tracker correl eye metric data potenti eye track scienc everyday life fulli realiz high acquisit cost tracker recent manufactur introduc low cost devic prepar wider underutil technolog scientist show independ manufactur low cost devic accur applic research real advent eye tracker arriv facilit develop propos simpl approach compar eye tracker adopt method psychologist practic diagnost decad correl construct show reliabl valid laboratori studi ran newer low cost eyetrib eye tracker establish sensomotor instrument eye tracker time posit design allow direct correl eye track metric devic time experi embed research project memori particip view pictur word make cognit judgment output tracker pupil size point regard high correl estim mix effect model calibr qualiti explain substanti amount individu differ gaze pupil size data qualiti compromis conclud low cost eye tracker case reliabl altern establish devic",0

In addition, the organization of search provides a potentially useful way to measure executive control over multitarget search. Although many useful cancellation measures have been introduced, most fail to make their way into research studies and clinical practice due to the practical difficulty of acquiring such parameters from traditional pen-and-paper measures.

In the present study, we experimentally manipulated response delay in a variation of the SART and found that commission errors, which are commonly used as an index of lapses in sustained attention, were a systematic function of manipulated differences in response delay. Delaying responses to roughly 800 ms after stimulus onset reduced commission errors substantially. We suggest the possibility that any technique that affects response speed will indirectly alter error rates independently of improvements in sustained attention.

"KeywordsTrail Making Test B/A ratio Executive functioning Non-dominant hand use ","non dominant hand use increases completion time on part b of the trail making test but not on part a","The Trail Making Test (TMT) is used in neuropsychological clinical practice to assess aspects of attention and executive function. The test consists of two parts (A and B) and requires drawing a trail between elements. Many patients are assessed with their non-dominant hand because of motor dysfunction that prevents them from using their dominant hand. Since drawing with the non-dominant hand is not an automatic task for many people, we explored the effect of hand use on TMT performance. The TMT was administered digitally in order to analyze new outcome measures in addition to total completion time. In a sample of 82 healthy participants, we found that non-dominant hand use increased completion times on the TMT B but not on the TMT A. The average completion time increased by almost 5 seconds, which may be clinically relevant. A substantial number of participants who performed the TMT with their non-dominant hand had a B/A ratio score of 2.5 or higher. In clinical practice, an abnormally high B/A ratio score may be falsely attributed to cognitive dysfunction.

"KeywordsVoice identity perception Individual differences Phonagnosia ","the bangor voice matching test a standardized test for the assessment of voice perception ability","Recognising the identity of conspecifics is an important yet highly variable skill. Approximately 2 % of the population suffers from a socially debilitating deficit in face recognition. More recently the existence of a similar deficit in voice perception has emerged (phonagnosia). Face perception tests have been readily available for years, advancing our understanding of underlying mechanisms in face perception. In contrast, voice perception has received less attention, and the construction of standardized voice perception tests has been neglected. Here we report the construction of the first standardized test for voice perception ability. Participants make a same/different identity decision after hearing two voice samples. Item Response Theory guided item selection to ensure the test discriminates between a range of abilities. The test provides a starting point for the systematic exploration of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying voice perception. With a high test-retest reliability (r=.86) and short assessment duration (~10 min) this test examines individual abilities reliably and quickly and therefore also has potential for use in developmental and neuropsychological populations.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","voic ident percept individu differ phonagnosia bangor voic match test standard test assess voic percept abil recognis ident conspecif import high variabl skill approxim popul suffer social debilit deficit face recognit recent exist similar deficit voic percept emerg phonagnosia face percept test readili year advanc understand under mechan face percept contrast voic percept receiv attent construct standard voic percept test neglect report construct standard test voic percept abil particip make ident decis hear voic sampl item respons theori guid item select ensur test discrimin rang abil test start point systemat explor cognit neural mechan under voic percept high test retest reliabl short assess durat min test examin individu abil reliabl quick potenti development neuropsycholog popul",0

This article introduces a new standard according to which reliabilities can be evaluated. This standard is based on the costs or time of the experiment and of administering the test. For example, if test administration costs are 7 % of the total experimental costs, the efficient value of the reliability is .93. If the actual reliability of a test is equal to this efficient reliability, the test size maximizes the statistical power of the experiment, given the costs. As a standard in experimental research, it is proposed that the reliability of the dependent variable be close to the efficient reliability. Adhering to this standard will enhance the statistical power and reduce the costs of experiments.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"No","attenu coeffici alpha effici reliabl power standard test reliabl group research author adher rule test reliabl group research articl introduc standard reliabl evalu standard base cost time experi administ test test administr cost total experiment cost effici reliabl actual reliabl test equal effici reliabl test size maxim statist power experi cost standard experiment research propos reliabl depend variabl close effici reliabl adher standard enhanc statist power reduc cost experi",0

Unfortunately, quantifying ambivalence has proven a daunting task, with researchers limited to studying vacillating ambivalence, VA (i.e., temporal oscillations between favor/disfavor evaluations of an attitude object). Here, we demonstrate the use of the density matrix to measure both VA and what we term “simultaneous ambivalence” (SA): ambivalence that manifests itself as “in the moment” concurrent favor/disfavor evaluations. In a methodological study we gave participants the option of either single-responding or double-responding to questionnaire items regarding a controversial topic (i.e., affirmative action). Since standard statistical procedures provide no means for analyzing double responses, such data are routinely treated as “bad.” As demonstrated here, the density matrix provides an unambiguous and relatively easy means of accounting for double responses, which is our indicator of SA. Our data are well explained by a mixture model, with participants divided into two nearly equal groups of SA and non-SA participants, and provide evidence that the general phenomenon of SA transcends differences of gender and ethnicity. Further, the density matrix data are consistent with viewing SA and VA as distinct ambivalence constructs.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","attitud ambival densiti matrix quantum probabl likert scale affirm action mind assess vacil simultan ambival densiti matrix ambival common experi permeat broad rang research quantifi ambival proven daunt task research limit studi vacil ambival va tempor oscil favordisfavor evalu attitud object demonstr densiti matrix measur va term simultan ambival sa ambival manifest moment concurr favordisfavor evalu methodolog studi gave particip option singl respond doubl respond questionnair item controversi topic affirm action standard statist procedur provid mean analyz doubl respons data routin treat bad demonstr densiti matrix unambigu easi mean account doubl respons indic sa data explain mixtur model particip divid equal group sa sa particip provid evid general phenomenon sa transcend differ gender ethnic densiti matrix data consist view sa va distinct ambival construct",0
"KeywordsPrediction Regression CART MARS Neural networks GAM Boosting ","the prediction of intelligence in preschool children using alternative models to regression","Statistical prediction of an outcome variable using multiple independent variables is a common practice in the social and behavioral sciences. For example, neuropsychologists are sometimes called upon to provide predictions of preinjury cognitive functioning for individuals who have suffered a traumatic brain injury. Typically, these predictions are made using standard multiple linear regression models with several demographic variables (e.g., gender, ethnicity, education level) as predictors. Prior research has shown conflicting evidence regarding the ability of such models to provide accurate predictions of outcome variables such as full-scale intelligence (FSIQ) test scores. The present study had two goals: (1) to demonstrate the utility of a set of alternative prediction methods that have been applied extensively in the natural sciences and business but have not been frequently explored in the social sciences and (2) to develop models that can be used to predict premorbid cognitive functioning in preschool children. Predictions of Stanford–Binet 5 FSIQ scores for preschool-aged children is used to compare the performance of a multiple regression model with several of these alternative methods. Results demonstrate that classification and regression treesprovided more accurate predictions of FSIQ scores than does the more traditional regression approach.

"KeywordsBinary data Multiblock data Hierarchical classifications HICLAS Multiset data Simultaneous clusterings of objects and variables Coupled binary data ","clusterwise hiclas a generic modeling strategy to trace similarities and differences in multiblock binary data","In many areas of the behavioral sciences, different groups of objects are measured on the same set of binary variables, resulting in coupled binary object × variable data blocks. Take, as an example, success/failure scores for different samples of testees, with each sample belonging to a different country, regarding a set of test items. When dealing with such data, a key challenge consists of uncovering the differences and similarities between the structural mechanisms that underlie the different blocks. To tackle this challenge for the case of a single data block, one may rely on HICLAS, in which the variables are reduced to a limited set of binary bundles that represent the underlying structural mechanisms, and the objects are given scores for these bundles. In the case of multiple binary data blocks, one may perform HICLAS on each data block separately. However, such an analysis strategy obscures the similarities and, in the case of many data blocks, also the differences between the blocks. To resolve this problem, we proposed the new Clusterwise HICLAS generic modeling strategy. In this strategy, the different data blocks are assumed to form a set of mutually exclusive clusters. For each cluster, different bundles are derived. As such, blocks belonging to the same cluster have the same bundles, whereas blocks of different clusters are modeled with different bundles. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of Clusterwise HICLAS by means of an extensive simulation study and by applying the strategy to coupled binary data regarding emotion differentiation and regulation.","Behavior Research Methods",2012,"No","binari data multiblock data hierarch classif hicla multiset data simultan cluster object variabl coupl binari data clusterwis hicla generic model strategi trace similar differ multiblock binari data area behavior scienc group object measur set binari variabl result coupl binari object variabl data block successfailur score sampl teste sampl belong countri set test item deal data key challeng consist uncov differ similar structur mechan underli block tackl challeng case singl data block reli hicla variabl reduc limit set binari bundl repres under structur mechan object score bundl case multipl binari data block perform hicla data block separ analysi strategi obscur similar case data block differ block resolv problem propos clusterwis hicla generic model strategi strategi data block assum form set mutual exclus cluster cluster bundl deriv block belong cluster bundl block cluster model bundl evalu perform clusterwis hicla mean extens simul studi appli strategi coupl binari data emot differenti regul",0

"KeywordsEvent-related potential General linear model Overlap Regularization Eye fixation-related potential P300 Speller ","regularization and a general linear model for event related potential estimation","The usual event-related potential (ERP) estimation is the average across epochs time-locked on stimuli of interest. These stimuli are repeated several times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and only one evoked potential is estimated inside the temporal window of interest. Consequently, the average estimation does not take into account other neural responses within the same epoch that are due to short inter stimuli intervals. These adjacent neural responses may overlap and distort the evoked potential of interest. This overlapping process is a significant issue for the eye fixation-related potential (EFRP) technique in which the epochs are time-locked on the ocular fixations. The inter fixation intervals are not experimentally controlled and can be shorter than the neural response’s latency. To begin, the Tikhonov regularization, applied to the classical average estimation, was introduced to improve the SNR for a given number of trials. The generalized cross validation was chosen to obtain the optimal value of the ridge parameter. Then, to deal with the issue of overlapping, the general linear model (GLM), was used to extract all neural responses inside an epoch. Finally, the regularization was also applied to it. The models (the classical average and the GLM with and without regularization) were compared on both simulated data and real datasets from a visual scene exploration in co-registration with an eye-tracker, and from a P300 Speller experiment. The regularization was found to improve the estimation by average for a given number of trials. The GLM was more robust and efficient, its efficiency actually reinforced by the regularization.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","event relat potenti general linear model overlap regular eye fixat relat potenti p speller regular general linear model event relat potenti estim usual event relat potenti erp estim averag epoch time lock stimuli interest stimuli repeat time improv signal nois ratio snr evok potenti estim insid tempor window interest averag estim account neural respons epoch due short inter stimuli interv adjac neural respons overlap distort evok potenti interest overlap process signific issu eye fixat relat potenti efrp techniqu epoch time lock ocular fixat inter fixat interv experiment control shorter neural respons latenc begin tikhonov regular appli classic averag estim introduc improv snr number trial general cross valid chosen obtain optim ridg paramet deal issu overlap general linear model glm extract neural respons insid epoch final regular appli model classic averag glm regular compar simul data real dataset visual scene explor registr eye tracker p speller experi regular found improv estim averag number trial glm robust effici effici reinforc regular",0

The neural mechanisms of prism adaptation have come under scrutiny since the observations that the technique can alleviate hemispatial neglect following stroke, and can alter spatial cognition in healthy controls. Relative to non-imaging behavioral studies, fMRI investigations of prism adaptation face several challenges arising from the confined physical environment of the scanner and the supine position of the participants. Any researcher who wishes to administer prism adaptation in an fMRI environment must adjust their procedures enough to enable the experiment to be performed, but not so much that the behavioral task departs too much from true prism adaptation. Furthermore, the specific temporal dynamics of behavioral components of prism adaptation present additional challenges for measuring their neural correlates. We developed a system for measuring the key features of prism adaptation behavior within an fMRI environment. To validate our configuration, we present behavioral (pointing) and head movement data from 11 right-hemisphere lesioned patients and 17 older controls who underwent sham and real prism adaptation in an MRI scanner. Most participants could adapt to prismatic displacement with minimal head movements, and the procedure was well tolerated.

"KeywordsMetaphor Analogy Measurement Conventionality Language Processing fluency ","are subjective ratings of metaphors a red herring the big two dimensions of metaphoric sentences","What makes some metaphors easier to understand than others? Several psycholinguistic dimensions have been identified as candidate answers to this question, including appeals to familiarity and aptness. One way to operationalize these dimensions is to collect ratings of them from naive participants. In this article, we question the construct validity of this approach. Do ratings of aptness actually reflect the aptness of the metaphors? Are ratings of aptness measuring something different from ratings of familiarity? With two experiments and an analysis of existing datasets, we argue that ratings of metaphoric sentences are confounded by how easily people are able to understand the sentences (processing fluency). In the experiments, a context manipulation was designed to affect how fluently people would process the metaphors. Experiment 1 confirmed that the manipulation affected how quickly people understood the sentences in a response time task. Experiment 2 revealed that the same manipulation influenced ratings of such dimensions as familiarity and aptness. Finally, factor analyses—on the ratings data from Experiment 2 and from several existing datasets—revealed two underlying sources of variance in sentence-level ratings of metaphors (the “big two” dimensions of metaphoric sentences): processing fluency and figurativeness. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of figurative-language processing by emphasizing more careful treatment of subjective ratings of metaphoric sentences, and by suggesting the use of alternative methods to manipulate and measure such dimensions as familiarity and aptness.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","metaphor analog measur convent languag process fluenci subject rate metaphor red herring big dimens metaphor sentenc make metaphor easier understand psycholinguist dimens identifi candid answer question includ appeal familiar apt operation dimens collect rate naiv particip articl question construct valid approach rate apt reflect apt metaphor rate apt measur rate familiar experi analysi exist dataset argu rate metaphor sentenc confound easili peopl understand sentenc process fluenci experi context manipul design affect fluentli peopl process metaphor experi confirm manipul affect quick peopl understood sentenc respons time task experi reveal manipul influenc rate dimens familiar apt final factor analys rate data experi exist dataset reveal under sourc varianc sentenc level rate metaphor big dimens metaphor sentenc process fluenci figur discuss implic find theori figur languag process emphas care treatment subject rate metaphor sentenc suggest altern method manipul measur dimens familiar apt",0
"KeywordsEye-tracking Inter-rater reliability Parsing ","one algorithm to rule them all an evaluation and discussion of ten eye movement event detection algorithms","Almost all eye-movement researchers use algorithms to parse raw data and detect distinct types of eye movement events, such as fixations, saccades, and pursuit, and then base their results on these. Surprisingly, these algorithms are rarely evaluated. We evaluated the classifications of ten eye-movement event detection algorithms, on data from an SMI HiSpeed 1250 system, and compared them to manual ratings of two human experts. The evaluation focused on fixations, saccades, and post-saccadic oscillations. The evaluation used both event duration parameters, and sample-by-sample comparisons to rank the algorithms. The resulting event durations varied substantially as a function of what algorithm was used. This evaluation differed from previous evaluations by considering a relatively large set of algorithms, multiple events, and data from both static and dynamic stimuli. The main conclusion is that current detectors of only fixations and saccades work reasonably well for static stimuli, but barely better than chance for dynamic stimuli. Differing results across evaluation methods make it difficult to select one winner for fixation detection. For saccade detection, however, the algorithm by Larsson, Nyström and Stridh (IEEE Transaction on Biomedical Engineering, 60(9):2484–2493,2013) outperforms all algorithms in data from both static and dynamic stimuli. The data also show how improperly selected algorithms applied to dynamic data misestimate fixation and saccade properties.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","eye track inter rater reliabl pars algorithm rule evalu discuss ten eye movement event detect algorithm eye movement research algorithm pars raw data detect distinct type eye movement event fixat saccad pursuit base result surpris algorithm rare evalu evalu classif ten eye movement event detect algorithm data smi hispe system compar manual rate human expert evalu focus fixat saccad post saccad oscil evalu event durat paramet sampl sampl comparison rank algorithm result event durat vari substanti function algorithm evalu differ previous evalu larg set algorithm multipl event data static dynam stimuli main conclus current detector fixat saccad work static stimuli bare chanc dynam stimuli differ result evalu method make difficult select winner fixat detect saccad detect algorithm larsson nystr stridh ieee transact biomed engin outperform algorithm data static dynam stimuli data show improp select algorithm appli dynam data misestim fixat saccad properti",0
"KeywordsBimodality Response distribution Dual-process models Single-process models Mouse-tracking ","assessing bimodality to detect the presence of a dual cognitive process","Researchers have long sought to distinguish between single-process and dual-process cognitive phenomena, using responses such as reaction times and, more recently, hand movements. Analysis of a response distribution’s modality has been crucial in detecting the presence of dual processes, because they tend to introduce bimodal features. Rarely, however, have bimodality measures been systematically evaluated. We carried out tests of readily available bimodality measures that any researcher may easily employ: the bimodality coefficient (BC), Hartigan’s dip statistic (HDS), and the difference in Akaike’s information criterion between one-component and two-component distribution models (AICdiff). We simulated distributions containing two response populations and examined the influences of (1) the distances between populations, (2) proportions of responses, (3) the amount of positive skew present, and (4) sample size. Distance always had a stronger effect than did proportion, and the effects of proportion greatly differed across the measures. Skew biased the measures by increasing bimodality detection, in some cases leading to anomalous interactive effects. BC and HDS were generally convergent, but a number of important discrepancies were found. AICdiff was extremely sensitive to bimodality and identified nearly all distributions as bimodal. However, all measures served to detect the presence of bimodality in comparison to unimodal simulations. We provide a validation with experimental data, discuss methodological and theoretical implications, and make recommendations regarding the choice of analysis.","Behavior Research Methods",2013,"No","bimod respons distribut dual process model singl process model mous track assess bimod detect presenc dual cognit process research long sought distinguish singl process dual process cognit phenomena respons reaction time recent hand movement analysi respons distribut modal crucial detect presenc dual process tend introduc bimod featur rare bimod measur systemat evalu carri test readili bimod measur research easili employ bimod coeffici bc hartigan dip statist hds differ akaik inform criterion compon compon distribut model aicdiff simul distribut respons popul examin influenc distanc popul proport respons amount posit skew present sampl size distanc stronger effect proport effect proport great differ measur skew bias measur increas bimod detect case lead anomal interact effect bc hds general converg number import discrep found aicdiff extrem sensit bimod identifi distribut bimod measur serv detect presenc bimod comparison unimod simul provid valid experiment data discuss methodolog theoret implic make recommend choic analysi",0

"KeywordsHand gesture Gesture coding system Continuous analysis ","a technique for continuous measurement of body movement from video","The movements that we make with our body vary continuously along multiple dimensions. However, many of the tools and techniques presently used for coding and analyzing hand gestures and other body movements yield categorical outcome variables. Focusing on categorical variables as the primary quantitative outcomes may mislead researchers or distort conclusions. Moreover, categorical systems may fail to capture the richness present in movement. Variations in body movement may be informative in multiple dimensions. For example, a single hand gesture has a unique size, height of production, trajectory, speed, and handshape. Slight variations in any of these features may alter how both the speaker and the listener are affected by gesture. In this paper, we describe a new method for measuring and visualizing the physical trajectory of movement using video. This method is generally accessible, requiring only video data and freely available computer software. This method allows researchers to examine features of hand gestures, body movement, and other motion, including size, height, curvature, and speed. We offer a detailed account of how to implement this approach, and we also offer some guidelines for situations where this approach may be fruitful in revealing how the body expresses information. Finally, we provide data from a small study on how speakers alter their hand gestures in response to different characteristics of a stimulus to demonstrate the utility of analyzing continuous dimensions of motion.

"KeywordsEye tracking Digital classroom Shared gaze ","real time sharing of gaze data between multiple eye trackersevaluation tools and advice","Technological advancements in combination with significant reductions in price have made it practically feasible to run experiments with multiple eye trackers. This enables new types of experiments with simultaneous recordings of eye movement data from several participants, which is of interest for researchers in, e.g., social and educational psychology. The Lund University Humanities Laboratory recently acquired 25 remote eye trackers, which are connected over a local wireless network. As a first step toward running experiments with this setup, demanding situations with real time sharing of gaze data were investigated in terms of network performance as well as clock and screen synchronization. Results show that data can be shared with a sufficiently low packet loss (0.1 %) and latency (M = 3 ms, M A D = 2 ms) across 8 eye trackers at a rate of 60 Hz. For a similar performance using 24 computers, the send rate needs to be reduced to 20 Hz. To help researchers conduct similar measurements on their own multi-eye-tracker setup, open source software written in Python and PsychoPy are provided. Part of the software contains a minimal working example to help researchers kick-start experiments with two or more eye trackers.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","eye track digit classroom share gaze real time share gaze data multipl eye trackersevalu tool advic technolog advanc combin signific reduct price made practic feasibl run experi multipl eye tracker enabl type experi simultan record eye movement data particip interest research social educ psycholog lund univers human laboratori recent acquir remot eye tracker connect local wireless network step run experi setup demand situat real time share gaze data investig term network perform clock screen synchron result show data share suffici low packet loss latenc ms ms eye tracker rate hz similar perform comput send rate reduc hz research conduct similar measur multi eye tracker setup open sourc softwar written python psychopi provid part softwar minim work research kick start experi eye tracker",0
"KeywordsDistributed semantic representation Sematic vectors Corpus analysis Contextual self-organizing map ","contextual self organizing map software for constructing semantic representations","In this article, we introduce a software package that applies a corpus-based algorithm to derive semantic representations of words. The algorithm relies on analyses of contextual information extracted from a text corpus—specifically, analyses of word co-occurrences in a large-scale electronic database of text. Here, a target word is represented as the combination of the average of all words preceding the target and all words following it in a text corpus. The semantic representation of the target words can be further processed by a self-organizing map (SOM; Kohonen, Self-organizing maps, 2001), an unsupervised neural network model that provides efficient data extraction and representation. Due to its topography-preserving features, the SOM projects the statistical structure of the context onto a 2-D space, such that words with similar meanings cluster together, forming groups that correspond to lexically meaningful categories. Such a representation system has its applications in a variety of contexts, including computational modeling of language acquisition and processing. In this report, we present specific examples from two languages (English and Chinese) to demonstrate how the method is applied to extract the semantic representations of words.","Behavior Research Methods",2011,"No","distribut semant represent semat vector corpus analysi contextu organ map contextu organ map softwar construct semant represent articl introduc softwar packag appli corpus base algorithm deriv semant represent word algorithm reli analys contextu inform extract text corpus specif analys word occurr larg scale electron databas text target word repres combin averag word preced target word text corpus semant represent target word process organ map som kohonen organ map unsupervis neural network model effici data extract represent due topographi preserv featur som project statist structur context space word similar mean cluster form group correspond lexic meaning categori represent system applic varieti context includ comput model languag acquisit process report present specif exampl languag english chines demonstr method appli extract semant represent word",0
"KeywordsCollective behavior Collective decision-making Group cohesion Fission–fusion societies ","methods for the effective study of collective behavior in a radial arm maze","Collective behaviors are observed throughout nature, from bacterial colonies to human societies. Important theoretical breakthroughs have recently been made in understanding why animals produce group behaviors and how they coordinate their activities, build collective structures, and make decisions. However, standardized experimental methods to test these findings have been lacking. Notably, easily and unambiguously determining the membership of a group and the responses of an individual within that group is still a challenge. The radial arm maze is presented here as a new standardized method to investigate collective exploration and decision-making in animal groups. This paradigm gives individuals within animal groups the opportunity to make choices among a set of discrete alternatives, and these choices can easily be tracked over long periods of time. We demonstrate the usefulness of this paradigm by performing a set of refuge-site selection experiments with groups of fish. Using an open-source, robust custom image-processing algorithm, we automatically counted the number of animals in each arm of the maze to identify the majority choice. We also propose a new index to quantify the degree of group cohesion in this context. The radial arm maze paradigm provides an easy way to categorize and quantify the choices made by animals. It makes it possible to readily apply the traditional uses of the radial arm maze with single animals to the study of animal groups. Moreover, it opens up the possibility of studying questions specifically related to collective behaviors.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","collect behavior collect decis make group cohes fission fusion societi method effect studi collect behavior radial arm maze collect behavior observ natur bacteri coloni human societi import theoret breakthrough recent made understand anim produc group behavior coordin activ build collect structur make decis standard experiment method test find lack notabl easili unambigu determin membership group respons individu group challeng radial arm maze present standard method investig collect explor decis make anim group paradigm individu anim group opportun make choic set discret altern choic easili track long period time demonstr use paradigm perform set refug site select experi group fish open sourc robust custom imag process algorithm automat count number anim arm maze identifi major choic propos index quantifi degre group cohes context radial arm maze paradigm easi categor quantifi choic made anim make readili appli tradit radial arm maze singl anim studi anim group open possibl studi question specif relat collect behavior",0

Here, the design of an automated Y-maze equipped with three infrared optocouplers per arm, and commanded by a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microcontroller is described. The software was devised for recording only true entries and exits to the arms. Experimental settings are programmed via a keyboard with three buttons and a display. The sequence of arm entries and the time spent in each arm and the neutral zone (NZ) are saved as a text file in a non-volatile memory for later transfer to a USB flash memory. Data files are analyzed with a program developed under LabVIEW® environment, and the results are exported to an Excel® spreadsheet file. Variables measured are: latency to exit the starting arm, sequence and number of arm entries, number of alternations, alternation percentage, and cumulative times spent in each arm and NZ. The automated Y-maze accurately detected the SAB decrease produced in rats by the muscarinic antagonist trihexyphenidyl, and its reversal by caffeine, having 100 % concordance with the alternation percentages calculated by two trained observers who independently watched videos of the same experiments. Although the values of time spent in the arms and NZ measured by the automated system had small discrepancies with those calculated by the observers, Bland-Altman analysis showed 95 % concordance in three pairs of comparisons, while in one it was 90 %, indicating that this system is a reliable and inexpensive alternative for the study of continuous SAB in rodents.","Behavior Research Methods",2016,"No","behavior test locomot short term memori infrar sensor autom system anticholinerg autom maze base reduc instruct set comput risc microcontrol assess continu spontan altern rat continu spontan altern behavior sab maze evalu work memori rodent design autom maze equip infrar optocoupl arm command reduc instruct set comput risc microcontrol softwar devis record true entri exit arm experiment set program keyboard button display sequenc arm entri time spent arm neutral zone nz save text file volatil memori transfer usb flash memori data file analyz program develop labview environ result export excel spreadsheet file variabl measur latenc exit start arm sequenc number arm entri number altern altern percentag cumul time spent arm nz autom maze accur detect sab decreas produc rat muscarin antagonist trihexyphenidyl revers caffein concord altern percentag calcul train observ independ watch video experi valu time spent arm nz measur autom system small discrep calcul observ bland altman analysi show concord pair comparison indic system reliabl inexpens altern studi continu sab rodent",0

Often keyboards are employed to collect buttonpresses, but their imprecision and variability decreases test power and increases the risk of false positives.

We propose using open-source Arduino microcontroller boards as an inexpensive and flexible alternative. These boards connect to standard experimental software using a USB connection and a virtual serial port, or by emulating a keyboard. In our solution, an Arduino measures response latencies after being signaled the start of a trial, and communicates the latency and response back to the PC over a USB connection. We demonstrated the reliability, robustness, and precision of this communication in six studies. Test measures confirmed that the error added to the measurement had an SD of less than 1 ms. Alternatively, emulation of a keyboard results in similarly precise measurement. The Arduino performs as well as a serial response box, and better than a keyboard.

This allows for the measurement of the similarity between dictionaries and spans of text ranging from complete documents to individual words. We show how DDR enables dictionary authors to place greater emphasis on construct validity without sacrificing linguistic coverage. We further demonstrate the benefits of DDR on two real-world tasks and finally conduct an extensive study of the interaction between dictionary size and task performance. These studies allow us to examine how DDR and word count methods complement one another as tools for applying concept dictionaries and where each is best applied.

Results showed that, as in adulthood, the three-factor model of empathy (i.e., emotional contagion, cognitive empathy, and emotional disconnection) was more relevant than the one- and two-factor ones. This means that as early as 6 years of age, children’s responses should reflect the same organization of the three components of empathy as those of adults. In line with the literature, cognitive empathy increased and emotional disconnection decreased in middle childhood, while emotional contagion remained stable.

The four suboptimal strategies are discarding words with zero frequencies, giving words with zero frequencies a very low frequency, adding 1 to the frequency per million, and making use of the Good–Turing algorithm. The good algorithm is the Laplace transformation, which consists of adding 1 to each frequency count and increasing the total corpus size by the number of word types observed. A strategy that may be acceptable is to guess the frequency of absent words on the basis of other corpora and then increasing the total corpus size by the estimated summed frequency of the missing words.

To validate the MTLD approach, we compared it against the performances of the primary competing indices in the field, which include vocd-D, TTR, Maas, Yule’s K, and an HD-D index derived directly from the hypergeometric distribution function. The comparisons involved assessments of convergent validity, divergent validity, internal validity, and incremental validity. The results of our assessments of these indices across two separate corpora suggest three major findings. First, MTLD performs well with respect to all four types of validity and is, in fact, the only index not found to vary as a function of text length. Second, HD-D is a viable alternative to the vocd-D standard. And third, three of the indices—MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas—appear to capture unique lexical information.

CASSIM estimates the syntax similarity between conversations by automatically generating syntactical representations of the sentences in conversation, estimating the structural differences between them, and calculating an optimized estimate of the conversation-level syntax similarity. After introducing and explaining this method, we report results from two method validation experiments (Study 1) and conduct a series of analyses with CASSIM to investigate syntax accommodation in social media discourse (Study 2). We run the same experiments using two well-known existing syntactic metrics, LSM and Coh-Metrix, and compare their results to CASSIM. Overall, our results indicate that CASSIM is able to reliably measure syntax similarity and to provide robust evidence of syntax accommodation within social media discourse.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","syntax similar linguist style match communic accommod theori social media text analysi syntax prime convers level syntax similar metric syntax semant human languag illumin individu psycholog differ import dimens social interact psycholog psycholinguist research begun incorpor sophist represent semant content understand connect word choic psycholog process work introduc convers level syntax similar metric cassim method calcul convers level syntax similar cassim estim syntax similar convers automat generat syntact represent sentenc convers estim structur differ calcul optim estim convers level syntax similar introduc explain method report result method valid experi studi conduct seri analys cassim investig syntax accommod social media discours studi run experi exist syntact metric lsm coh metrix compar result cassim result cassim reliabl measur syntax similar provid robust evid syntax accommod social media discours",0

The program was developed because manual coding of large collections of computerized transcripts cannot possibly be completed within a reasonable time span. CHIP codes parent-child conversational data as stored in transcript files and computes a series of descriptive statistics based on these codes. Parental responses to child utterances and child responses to parent utterances are both coded. This allows for an analysis of the reciprocal relationship between parental and child language. Three longitudinal corpora from CHILDES (totaling 151,900 utterances) were coded and analyzed by CHIP. The results indicated a high degree of contingency between parental and child language for different word classes across a large span of development. Two main points are argued: (1) Automatic data coding and analysis programs are important new tools for transcript analysis, and (2) CHIP, as an example of such a tool, can provide detailed information concerning the exact nature of parent-child conversational interactions.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",1990,"No","exact match lexic item word class child languag child utter chip framework automat code analysi parent child convers interact chip comput program automat code analysi parent child convers interact program develop manual code larg collect computer transcript possibl complet reason time span chip code parent child convers data store transcript file comput seri descript statist base code parent respons child utter child respons parent utter code analysi reciproc relationship parent child languag longitudin corpora child total utter code analyz chip result high degre conting parent child languag word class larg span develop main point argu automat data code analysi program import tool transcript analysi chip tool provid detail inform exact natur parent child convers interact",0
"KeywordsLSA similarity Crowdsourcing Computerized summary scoring ","computerized summary scoring crowdsourcing based latent semantic analysis","In this study we developed and evaluated a crowdsourcing-based latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach to computerized summary scoring (CSS). LSA is a frequently used mathematical component in CSS, where LSA similarity represents the extent to which the to-be-graded target summary is similar to a model summary or a set of exemplar summaries. Researchers have proposed different formulations of the model summary in previous studies, such as pregraded summaries, expert-generated summaries, or source texts. The former two methods, however, require substantial human time, effort, and costs in order to either grade or generate summaries. Using source texts does not require human effort, but it also does not predict human summary scores well. With human summary scores as the gold standard, in this study we evaluated the crowdsourcing LSA method by comparing it with seven other LSA methods that used sets of summaries from different sources (either experts or crowdsourced) of differing quality, along with source texts. Results showed that crowdsourcing LSA predicted human summary scores as well as expert-good and crowdsourcing-good summaries, and better than the other methods. A series of analyses with different numbers of crowdsourcing summaries demonstrated that the number (from 10 to 100) did not significantly affect performance. These findings imply that crowdsourcing LSA is a promising approach to CSS, because it saves human effort in generating the model summary while still yielding comparable performance. This approach to small-scale CSS provides a practical solution for instructors in courses, and also advances research on automated assessments in which student responses are expected to semantically converge on subject matter content.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","lsa similar crowdsourc computer summari score computer summari score crowdsourc base latent semant analysi studi develop evalu crowdsourc base latent semant analysi lsa approach computer summari score css lsa frequent mathemat compon css lsa similar repres extent grade target summari similar model summari set exemplar summari research propos formul model summari previous studi pregrad summari expert generat summari sourc text method requir substanti human time effort cost order grade generat summari sourc text requir human effort predict human summari score human summari score gold standard studi evalu crowdsourc lsa method compar lsa method set summari sourc expert crowdsourc differ qualiti sourc text result show crowdsourc lsa predict human summari score expert good crowdsourc good summari method seri analys number crowdsourc summari demonstr number signific affect perform find impli crowdsourc lsa promis approach css save human effort generat model summari yield compar perform approach small scale css practic solut instructor cours advanc research autom assess student respons expect semant converg subject matter content",0

This package enables a variety of functions and computations based on Vector Semantic Models such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Landauer, Foltz and Laham (Discourse Processes 25:259–284, 1998), which are procedures to obtain a high-dimensional vector representation for words (and documents) from a text corpus. Such representations are thought to capture the semantic meaning of a word (or document) and allow for semantic similarity comparisons between words to be calculated as the cosine of the angle between their associated vectors. LSAfun uses pre-created LSA spaces and provides functions for (a) Similarity Computations between words, word lists, and documents; (b) Neighborhood Computations, such as obtaining a word’s or document’s most similar words, (c) plotting such a neighborhood, as well as similarity structures for any word lists, in a two- or three-dimensional approximation using Multidimensional Scaling, (d) Applied Functions, such as computing the coherence of a text, answering multiple choice questions and producing generic text summaries; and (e) Composition Methods for obtaining vector representations for two-word phrases.

"KeywordsCohesion network analysis, Computer-supported collaborative learning Cohesion-based discourse analysis Participation evaluation Dialogism Polyphonic model ","cohesion network analysis of cscl participation","The broad use of computer-supported collaborative-learning (CSCL) environments (e.g., instant messenger–chats, forums, blogs in online communities, and massive open online courses) calls for automated tools to support tutors in the time-consuming process of analyzing collaborative conversations. In this article, the authors propose and validate the cohesion network analysis (CNA) model, housed within the ReaderBench platform. CNA, grounded in theories of cohesion, dialogism, and polyphony, is similar to social network analysis (SNA), but it also considers text content and discourse structure and, uniquely, uses automated cohesion indices to generate the underlying discourse representation. Thus, CNA enhances the power of SNA by explicitly considering semantic cohesion while modeling interactions between participants. The primary purpose of this article is to describe CNA analysis and to provide a proof of concept, by using ten chat conversations in which multiple participants debated the advantages of CSCL technologies. Each participant’s contributions were human-scored on the basis of their relevance in terms of covering the central concepts of the conversation. SNA metrics, applied to the CNA sociogram, were then used to assess the quality of each member’s degree of participation. The results revealed that the CNA indices were strongly correlated to the human evaluations of the conversations. Furthermore, a stepwise regression analysis indicated that the CNA indices collectively predicted 54% of the variance in the human ratings of participation. The results provide promising support for the use of automated computational assessments of collaborative participation and of individuals’ degrees of active involvement in CSCL environments.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","cohes network analysi comput support collabor learn cohes base discours analysi particip evalu dialog polyphon model cohes network analysi cscl particip broad comput support collabor learn cscl environ instant messeng chat forum blog onlin communiti massiv open onlin cours call autom tool support tutor time consum process analyz collabor convers articl author propos valid cohes network analysi cna model hous readerbench platform cna ground theori cohes dialog polyphoni similar social network analysi sna consid text content discours structur uniqu autom cohes indic generat under discours represent cna enhanc power sna explicit semant cohes model interact particip primari purpos articl describ cna analysi provid proof concept ten chat convers multipl particip debat advantag cscl technolog particip contribut human score basi relev term cover central concept convers sna metric appli cna sociogram assess qualiti member degre particip result reveal cna indic strong correl human evalu convers stepwis regress analysi cna indic collect predict varianc human rate particip result provid promis support autom comput assess collabor particip individu degre activ involv cscl environ",0
"KeywordsMultiple documents integration Natural language processing Reading Writing ","assessing the use of multiple sources in student essays","The present study explored different approaches for automatically scoring student essays that were written on the basis of multiple texts. Specifically, these approaches were developed to classify whether or not important elements of the texts were present in the essays. The first was a simple pattern-matching approach called “multi-word” that allowed for flexible matching of words and phrases in the sentences. The second technique was latent semantic analysis (LSA), which was used to compare student sentences to original source sentences using its high-dimensional vector-based representation. Finally, the third was a machine-learning technique, support vector machines, which learned a classification scheme from the corpus. The results of the study suggested that the LSA-based system was superior for detecting the presence of explicit content from the texts, but the multi-word pattern-matching approach was better for detecting inferences outside or across texts.

The study was guided by the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion, which includes a central route (represented by formal discourse) versus a peripheral route (represented by informal discourse) to persuasion. The results revealed that these leaders adopted the formal, central route more when they were in power than before they came into power. The nation’s education level was a significant factor in the leaders’ adoption of the persuasion strategy. The leaders’ formality also decreased with their increasing age and in-power times.

"KeywordsPrint exposure Author recognition test Item response theory Eye movements Reading ","reading ability and print exposure item response theory analysis of the author recognition test","In the author recognition test (ART), participants are presented with a series of names and foils and are asked to indicate which ones they recognize as authors. The test is a strong predictor of reading skill, and this predictive ability is generally explained as occurring because author knowledge is likely acquired through reading or other forms of print exposure. In this large-scale study (1,012 college student participants), we used item response theory (IRT) to analyze item (author) characteristics in order to facilitate identification of the determinants of item difficulty, provide a basis for further test development, and optimize scoring of the ART. Factor analysis suggested a potential two-factor structure of the ART, differentiating between literary and popular authors. Effective and ineffective author names were identified so as to facilitate future revisions of the ART. Analyses showed that the ART is a highly significant predictor of the time spent encoding words, as measured using eyetracking during reading. The relationship between the ART and time spent reading provided a basis for implementing a higher penalty for selecting foils, rather than the standard method of ART scoring (names selected minus foils selected). The findings provide novel support for the view that the ART is a valid indicator of reading volume. Furthermore, they show that frequency data can be used to select items of appropriate difficulty, and that frequency data from corpora based on particular time periods and types of texts may allow adaptations of the test for different populations.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"No","print exposur author recognit test item respons theori eye movement read read abil print exposur item respons theori analysi author recognit test author recognit test art particip present seri name foil ask recogn author test strong predictor read skill predict abil general explain occur author knowledg acquir read form print exposur larg scale studi colleg student particip item respons theori irt analyz item author characterist order facilit identif determin item difficulti provid basi test develop optim score art factor analysi suggest potenti factor structur art differenti literari popular author effect ineffect author name identifi facilit futur revis art analys show art high signific predictor time spent encod word measur eyetrack read relationship art time spent read provid basi implement higher penalti select foil standard method art score name select minus foil select find provid support view art valid indic read volum show frequenc data select item difficulti frequenc data corpora base time period type text adapt test popul",0

The advantages of this automatic real-time approach are that obtaining speech data is nonobstrusive and is free from sensor application and calibration efforts. Different types of acoustic features derived from speech, speaker, and emotion recognition were employed (frame-level-based speech features). Combing these features with high-level contour descriptors, which capture the temporal information of frame-level descriptor contours, results in 45,088 features per speech sample. In general, the measurement proceß follows the speech-adapted steps of pattern recognition: (1) recording speech, (2) preproceßing, (3) feature computation (using perceptual and signal-proceßing-related features such as, e.g., fundamental frequency, intensity, pause patterns, formants, and cepstral coefficients), (4) dimensionality reduction, (5) claßification, and (6) evaluation. After a correlation-filter-based feature subset selection employed on the feature space in order to find most relevant features, different claßification models were trained.

In the first study reported here, we expanded on a previous study to examine how different semantic space models and modeling parameters affect the abilities of these computational models to predict brain activation in a data-driven set of 500 selected voxels. The findings suggest that these computational models may contain distinct types of semantic information that relate to different brain areas in different ways. On the basis of these findings, in a second study we conducted an additional exploratory analysis of theoretically motivated brain regions in the language network.

"KeywordsVirtual Reality Prediction Language Comprehension Eyetracking Visual World ","language driven anticipatory eye movements in virtual reality","Predictive language processing is often studied by measuring eye movements as participants look at objects on a computer screen while they listen to spoken sentences. This variant of the visual-world paradigm has revealed that information encountered by a listener at a spoken verb can give rise to anticipatory eye movements to a target object, which is taken to indicate that people predict upcoming words. The ecological validity of such findings remains questionable, however, because these computer experiments used two-dimensional stimuli that were mere abstractions of real-world objects. Here we present a visual-world paradigm study in a three-dimensional (3-D) immersive virtual reality environment. Despite significant changes in the stimulus materials and the different mode of stimulus presentation, language-mediated anticipatory eye movements were still observed. These findings thus indicate that people do predict upcoming words during language comprehension in a more naturalistic setting where natural depth cues are preserved. Moreover, the results confirm the feasibility of using eyetracking in rich and multimodal 3-D virtual environments.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","virtual realiti predict languag comprehens eyetrack visual world languag driven anticipatori eye movement virtual realiti predict languag process studi measur eye movement particip object comput screen listen spoken sentenc variant visual world paradigm reveal inform encount listen spoken verb give rise anticipatori eye movement target object peopl predict upcom word ecolog valid find remain question comput experi dimension stimuli mere abstract real world object present visual world paradigm studi dimension immers virtual realiti environ signific stimulus materi mode stimulus present languag mediat anticipatori eye movement observ find peopl predict upcom word languag comprehens naturalist set natur depth cue preserv result confirm feasibl eyetrack rich multimod virtual environ",0

"KeywordsNatural language processing Student constructed responses Computer-based assessment ","computer based assessment of student constructed responses","Student-constructed responses, such as essays, short-answer questions, and think-aloud protocols, provide a valuable opportunity to gauge student learning outcomes and comprehension strategies. However, given the challenges of grading student-constructed responses, instructors may be hesitant to use them. There have been major advances in the application of natural language processing of student-constructed responses. This literature review focuses on two dimensions that need to be considered when developing new systems. The first is type of response provided by the student—namely, meaning-making responses (e.g., think-aloud protocols, tutorial dialogue) and products of comprehension (e.g., essays, open-ended questions). The second corresponds to considerations of the type of natural language processing systems used and how they are applied to analyze the student responses. We argue that the appropriateness of the assessment protocols is, in part, constrained by the type of response and researchers should use hybrid systems that rely on multiple, convergent natural language algorithms.","Behavior Research Methods",2012,"No","natur languag process student construct respons comput base assess comput base assess student construct respons student construct respons essay short answer question aloud protocol provid valuabl opportun gaug student learn outcom comprehens strategi challeng grade student construct respons instructor hesit major advanc applic natur languag process student construct respons literatur review focus dimens consid develop system type respons provid student mean make respons aloud protocol tutori dialogu product comprehens essay open end question correspond consider type natur languag process system appli analyz student respons argu appropri assess protocol part constrain type respons research hybrid system reli multipl converg natur languag algorithm",0

Covariance structure analysis is frequently used for analyzing data obtained in nonexperimental or quasiexperimental research, but is seldom employed in experimental research.

"KeywordsSemantic memory Executive functions Creativity Research methods Psychometrics ","remote associates test an empirical proof of concept","Associative processes play a major role in research on human thinking, especially creativity. One of the most influential models emphasizing associative processes in creative thinking was introduced by Mednick (Psychological Review, 69, 220–232, 1962), who developed the remote associates test (RAT) as a domain-general measure of individual differences in associative hierarchies. Although S. Mednick’s theoretical framework has recently regained much attention, the fundamental psychometric assumptions and underlying cognitive processes involved in the RAT remain controversial. We carried out two studies to evaluate these issues. In the first, a confirmatory factor analysis showed that a single latent factor accounted for the ability to solve RAT problems, despite their psycholinguistic heterogeneity. Subsequent regression analyses indicated that cue–solution associative remoteness substantially determined the difficulty of RAT problems, accounting for about 80% of variance. In the second study we used a newly developed associative chain test (ACT), which assesses lexical–semantic and executive measures during associative processing. We found that performance on the RAT was related to lexical–semantic (higher response remoteness and lower response commonness) but not to executive (response inhibition and switching) ACT measures. Overall, our findings indicate that the RAT reflects a coherent ability to access and combine remote elements in lexical–semantic and associative networks without considerably engaging executive attention. Although the validity and utility of the RAT was supported, we propose that the ACT provides a more complex and fine-grained tool for the assessment of associative processing.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","semant memori execut function creativ research method psychometr remot associ test empir proof concept associ process play major role research human think creativ influenti model emphas associ process creativ think introduc mednick psycholog review develop remot associ test rat domain general measur individu differ associ hierarchi mednick theoret framework recent regain attent fundament psychometr assumpt under cognit process involv rat remain controversi carri studi evalu issu confirmatori factor analysi show singl latent factor account abil solv rat problem psycholinguist heterogen subsequ regress analys cue solut associ remot substanti determin difficulti rat problem account varianc studi newli develop associ chain test act assess lexic semant execut measur associ process found perform rat relat lexic semant higher respons remot lower respons common execut respons inhibit switch act measur find rat reflect coher abil access combin remot element lexic semant associ network consider engag execut attent valid util rat support propos act complex fine grain tool assess associ process",0

The AMT is regarded as one of the most important assessment tools to study memory dysfunctions (e.g., difficulty recalling the specific details of memories) in psychopathology. In Study 1, we utilized the Japanese corpus data of 12,400 cue-recalled memories tagged with observer-rated specificity. We extracted linguistic features of particular relevance to memory specificity, such as past tense, negation, and adverbial words and phrases pertaining to time and location. On the basis of these features, a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to classify the memories into specific and nonspecific categories, which achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of .92 in a performance test. In Study 2, the trained SVM was tested in terms of its robustness in classifying novel memories (n = 8,478) that were retrieved in response to cue words that were different from those used in Study 1. The SVM showed an AUC of .89 in classifying the new memories. In Study 3, we extended the binary SVM to a five-class classification of the AMT, which achieved 64%–65% classification accuracy, against the chance level (20%) in the performance tests. Our data suggest that memory specificity can be identified with a relatively small number of words, capturing the universal linguistic features of memory specificity across memories in diverse contents.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","autobiograph memori natur languag process machin learn support vector machin unravel linguist natur specif autobiograph memori computer classif algorithm present studi explor linguist natur specif memori generat autobiograph memori test amt develop computer classifi distinguish specif nonspecif memori amt regard import assess tool studi memori dysfunct difficulti recal specif detail memori psychopatholog studi util japanes corpus data cue recal memori tag observ rate specif extract linguist featur relev memori specif past tens negat adverbi word phrase pertain time locat basi featur support vector machin svm train classifi memori specif nonspecif categori achiev area curv auc perform test studi train svm test term robust classifi memori retriev respons cue word studi svm show auc classifi memori studi extend binari svm class classif amt achiev classif accuraci chanc level perform test data suggest memori specif identifi small number word captur univers linguist featur memori specif memori divers content",0
"KeywordsReading Speed Measurement Sentence Generator Psychophysics ","a new sentence generator providing material for maximum reading speed measurement","A new method is proposed to generate text material for assessing maximum reading speed of adult readers. The described procedure allows one to generate a vast number of equivalent short sentences. These sentences can be displayed for different durations in order to determine the reader’s maximum speed using a psychophysical threshold algorithm. Each sentence is built so that it is either true or false according to common knowledge. The actual reading is verified by asking the reader to determine the truth value of each sentence. We based our design on the generator described by Crossland et al. and upgraded it. The new generator handles concepts distributed in an ontology, which allows an easy determination of the sentences’ truth value and control of lexical and psycholinguistic parameters. In this way many equivalent sentence can be generated and displayed to perform the measurement. Maximum reading speed scores obtained with pseudo-randomly chosen sentences from the generator were strongly correlated with maximum reading speed scores obtained with traditional MNREAD sentences (r = .836). Furthermore, the large number of sentences that can be generated makes it possible to perform repeated measurements, since the possibility of a reader learning individual sentences is eliminated. Researchers interested in within-reader performance variability could use the proposed method for this purpose.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"No","read speed measur sentenc generat psychophys sentenc generat provid materi maximum read speed measur method propos generat text materi assess maximum read speed adult reader procedur generat vast number equival short sentenc sentenc display durat order determin reader maximum speed psychophys threshold algorithm sentenc built true fals common knowledg actual read verifi reader determin truth sentenc base design generat crossland al upgrad generat handl concept distribut ontolog easi determin sentenc truth control lexic psycholinguist paramet equival sentenc generat display perform measur maximum read speed score obtain pseudo random chosen sentenc generat strong correl maximum read speed score obtain tradit mnread sentenc larg number sentenc generat make perform repeat measur possibl reader learn individu sentenc elimin research interest reader perform variabl propos method purpos",0

Two issues are discussed that researchers must attend to when evaluating the utility of LSA for predicting psychological phenomena. First, the role of semantic relatedness in the psychological process of interest must be understood. LSA indices of similarity should then be derived from this theoretical understanding. Second, the knowledge base (semantic space) from which similarity indices are generated must contain “knowledge” that is appropriate to the task at hand. Proposed solutions are illustrated with data from an experiment in which LSA-based indices were generated from theoretical analysis of the processes involved in understanding two conflicting accounts of a historical event.

In Experiment 2, animals that were fitted binocularly with opaque eye covers performed as if blind on a task involving acquisition of pattern discrimination. In Experiment 3, binocular coverage with the opaque eye cover resulted in chance performance across 300 trials of a previously acquired pattern-discrimination habit. In Experiment 4, the base diameter of the eye cover was found to be a critical factor: Performance of a previously acquired brightness discrimination was reduced to chance levels by contact eye covers that approximated 7.0 mm in diameter. In Experiment 5, a smaller eye cover (6-mm diam) had no effect in limiting the visually evoked electrocortical response of the albino rat, while an eye cover of 7.2-mm diam produced a reliable attenuation of the response.

BRCA Gist appears to be the first ITS designed to assist patients’ health decision making. Two studies provide fine-grained analyses of the verbal interactions between BRCA Gist and women responding to five questions pertaining to breast cancer and genetic risk. We examined how “gist explanations” generated by participants during natural-language dialogues related to outcomes. Using reliable rubrics, scripts of the participants’ verbal interactions with BRCA Gist were rated for content and for the appropriateness of the tutor’s responses.

"KeywordsFixation duration Infant Eyetracker methodology Attention Naturalistic Free viewing ","parsing eye tracking data of variable quality to provide accurate fixation duration estimates in infants and adults","Researchers studying infants’ spontaneous allocation of attention have traditionally relied on hand-coding infants’ direction of gaze from videos; these techniques have low temporal and spatial resolution and are labor intensive. Eye-tracking technology potentially allows for much more precise measurement of how attention is allocated at the subsecond scale, but a number of technical and methodological issues have given rise to caution about the quality and reliability of high temporal resolution data obtained from infants. We present analyses suggesting that when standard dispersal-based fixation detection algorithms are used to parse eye-tracking data obtained from infants, the results appear to be heavily influenced by interindividual variations in data quality. We discuss the causes of these artifacts, including fragmentary fixations arising from flickery or unreliable contact with the eyetracker and variable degrees of imprecision in reported position of gaze. We also present new algorithms designed to cope with these problems by including a number of new post hoc verification checks to identify and eliminate fixations that may be artifactual.

"KeywordsVoice Expression Prosody Acoustic Frequency Intensity ","a psychometric investigation of macroscopic speech measures for clinical and psychological science","The analysis of vocal expression is a critical endeavor for psychological and clinical sciences and is an increasingly popular application for computer–human interfaces. Despite this, and despite advances in the efficiency, affordability, and sophistication of vocal analytic technologies, there is considerable variability across studies regarding what aspects of vocal expression are studied. Vocal signals can be quantified in a myriad of ways, and their underlying structure, at least with respect to “macroscopic” measures from extended speech, is presently unclear. To address this issue, we evaluated the psychometric properties—notably, the structural and construct validity—of a systematically defined set of global vocal features. Our analytic strategy focused on (a) identifying redundant variables among this set, (b) employing principal components analysis (PCA) to identify nonoverlapping domains of vocal expression, (c) examining the degrees to which the vocal variables are modulated as a function of changes in speech task, and (d) evaluating the relationship between the vocal variables and cognitive (i.e., verbal fluency) and clinical (i.e., depression, anxiety, and hostility) variables. Spontaneous speech samples from 11 independent studies of young adults (>60 s in length), employing one of three different speaking tasks, were examined (N = 1,350). Confounding variables (i.e., sex, ethnicity) were statistically controlled for. The PCA identified six distinct domains of vocal expression. Collectively, vocal expression (defined in terms of these domains) was modulated as a function of speech task and was related to the cognitive and clinical variables. These findings provide empirically grounded implications for the study of vocal expression in psychological and clinical sciences.","Behavior Research Methods",2016,"No","voic express prosodi acoust frequenc intens psychometr investig macroscop speech measur clinic psycholog scienc analysi vocal express critic endeavor psycholog clinic scienc increas popular applic comput human interfac advanc effici afford sophist vocal analyt technolog consider variabl studi aspect vocal express studi vocal signal quantifi myriad way under structur respect macroscop measur extend speech present unclear address issu evalu psychometr properti notabl structur construct valid systemat defin set global vocal featur analyt strategi focus identifi redund variabl set employ princip compon analysi pca identifi nonoverlap domain vocal express examin degre vocal variabl modul function speech task evalu relationship vocal variabl cognit verbal fluenci clinic depress anxieti hostil variabl spontan speech sampl independ studi young adult length employ speak task examin confound variabl sex ethnic statist control pca identifi distinct domain vocal express collect vocal express defin term domain modul function speech task relat cognit clinic variabl find provid empir ground implic studi vocal express psycholog clinic scienc",0

Next, ECHO predicted, a priori, subjects’ text-based believability ratings. Later, the bifurcation/bootstrapping method was developed to elicit and account for individuals’ background knowledge, while assessing intercoder reliability regarding ECHO simulations. Finally,Convince Me, our “reasoner’s workbench,” automated the explication both of subjects’ knowledge bases and of their belief assessments; theConvince Me software permits contrasts between the model’s predictions and subjects’ proposition-wise evaluations.

Mean activity in the lesioned baboon was 41% less than that of the nonlesioned baboon measured over a 14-day period. In addition, the daily maximum activity value was significantly less in the MPTP-treated baboon. Moreover, resting and sleeping periods were 30% greater in the lesioned animal. The akinesia and resting and sleeping periods were displayed by the lesioned baboon throughout the day, whereas the control baboon showed them only at night. The data representing summarized movement activity are in accordance with observations of bradykinesia, hypokinesia, and akinesia of the MPTP-treated baboon.

"KeywordsVideo Clip Video Code Startle Response Intercoder Reliability Startle Magnitude ","comparison of video and emg based evaluations of the magnitude of childrens emotion modulated startle response","We investigated the reliability and validity of a video-based method of measuring the magnitude of children’s emotion-modulated startle response when electromyographic (EMG) measurement is not feasible. Thirty-one children between the ages of 4 and 7 years were videotaped while watching short video clips designed to elicit happiness or fear. Embedded in the audio track of the video clips were acoustic startle probes. A coding system was developed to quantify from the video record the strength of the eye-blink startle response to the probes. EMG measurement of the eye blink was obtained simultaneously. Intercoder reliability for the video coding was high (Cohen’sκ = .90). The average within-subjects probe-by-probe correlation between the EMG- and video-based methods was .84. Group-level correlations between the methods were also strong, and there was some evidence of emotion modulation of the startle response with both the EMG- and the video-derived data. Although the video method cannot be used to assess the latency, probability, or duration of startle blinks, the findings indicate that it can serve as a valid proxy of EMG in the assessment of the magnitude of emotion-modulated startle in studies of children conducted outside of a laboratory setting, where traditional psychophysiological methods are not feasible.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",2003,"No","video clip video code startl respons intercod reliabl startl magnitud comparison video emg base evalu magnitud children emot modul startl respons investig reliabl valid video base method measur magnitud children emot modul startl respons electromyograph emg measur feasibl thirti children age year videotap watch short video clip design elicit happi fear embed audio track video clip acoust startl probe code system develop quantifi video record strength eye blink startl respons probe emg measur eye blink obtain simultan intercod reliabl video code high cohen averag subject probe probe correl emg video base method group level correl method strong evid emot modul startl respons emg video deriv data video method assess latenc probabl durat startl blink find serv valid proxi emg assess magnitud emot modul startl studi children conduct laboratori set tradit psychophysiolog method feasibl",0

During a computerized version of SERT practice, students read texts and typed self-explanations into a computer after each sentence. The use of SERT strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self-explanations. This assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and LSA. Both human judgments and LSA were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with SERT tended to paraphrase the text sentences, whereas students who were compliant with SERT tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context.

This study exemplarily used sentence reading as a stand-in for paradigms that assess pupil size in tasks during which changes in gaze position are unavoidable. The influence of gaze position on pupil size was first investigated by an artificial eye model with a fixed pupil size. Despite its fixed pupil size, the systematic measurements of the artificial eye model revealed substantial gaze-position-dependent changes in the measured pupil size. We evaluated two functions and showed that they can accurately capture and correct the gaze-dependent measurement error of pupil size recorded during a sentence-reading and an effortless z-string-scanning task.

"KeywordsMonocular occlusion Vision Learning Behavior Rodents ","design of a noninvasive face mask for ocular occlusion in rats and assessment in a visual discrimination paradigm","The rat visual system is structured such that the large (>90 %) majority of retinal ganglion axons reach the contralateral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortex (V1). This anatomical design allows for the relatively selective activation of one cerebral hemisphere under monocular viewing conditions. Here, we describe the design of a harness and face mask allowing simple and noninvasive monocular occlusion in rats. The harness is constructed from synthetic fiber (shoelace-type material) and fits around the girth region and neck, allowing for easy adjustments to fit rats of various weights. The face mask consists of soft rubber material that is attached to the harness by Velcro strips. Eyeholes in the mask can be covered by additional Velcro patches to occlude either one or both eyes. Rats readily adapt to wearing the device, allowing behavioral testing under different types of viewing conditions. We show that rats successfully acquire a water-maze-based visual discrimination task under monocular viewing conditions. Following task acquisition, interocular transfer was assessed. Performance with the previously occluded, “untrained” eye was impaired, suggesting that training effects were partially confined to one cerebral hemisphere. The method described herein provides a simple and noninvasive means to restrict visual input for studies of visual processing and learning in various rodent species.","Behavior Research Methods",2012,"No","monocular occlus vision learn behavior rodent design noninvas face mask ocular occlus rat assess visual discrimin paradigm rat visual system structur larg major retin ganglion axon reach contralater later genicul nucleus lgn visual cortex v anatom design select activ cerebr hemispher monocular view condit describ design har face mask allow simpl noninvas monocular occlus rat har construct synthet fiber shoelac type materi fit girth region neck allow easi adjust fit rat weight face mask consist soft rubber materi attach har velcro strip eyehol mask cover addit velcro patch occlud eye rat readili adapt wear devic allow behavior test type view condit show rat success acquir water maze base visual discrimin task monocular view condit task acquisit interocular transfer assess perform previous occlud untrain eye impair suggest train effect partial confin cerebr hemispher method simpl noninvas mean restrict visual input studi visual process learn rodent speci",0

"KeywordsLow-cost eye tracker Reading aid Fixation mapping algorithm Data quality Elementary school ","improving the performance of eye trackers with limited spatial accuracy and low sampling rates for reading analysis by heuristic fixation to word mapping","The recent growth in low-cost eye-tracking systems makes it feasible to incorporate real-time measurement and analysis of eye position data into activities such as learning to read. It also enables field studies of reading behavior in the classroom and other learning environments. We present a study of the data quality provided by two remote eye trackers, one being a low-sampling-rate, low-cost system. Then we present two algorithms for mapping fixations derived from the data to the words being read. One is for immediate (or real-time) mapping of fixations to words and the other for deferred (or post hoc) mapping. Following this, an evaluation study is reported. Both studies were carried out in the classroom of a Finnish elementary school with students who were second graders. This study shows very high success rates in automatically mapping fixations to the lines of text being read when the mapping is deferred. The success rates for immediate mapping are comparable with those obtained in earlier studies, although here the data is collected some 10 min after initial calibration of low-sample (30 Hz) remote eye trackers, rather than a laboratory setting using high-sampling-rate trackers. The results provide a solid basis for developing systems for use in classrooms and other learning environments that can provide immediate automatic support with reading, and share data between a group of learners and the teacher of that group. This makes possible new approaches to the learning of reading and comprehension skills.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","low cost eye tracker read aid fixat map algorithm data qualiti elementari school improv perform eye tracker limit spatial accuraci low sampl rate read analysi heurist fixat word map recent growth low cost eye track system make feasibl incorpor real time measur analysi eye posit data activ learn read enabl field studi read behavior classroom learn environ present studi data qualiti provid remot eye tracker low sampl rate low cost system present algorithm map fixat deriv data word read real time map fixat word defer post hoc map evalu studi report studi carri classroom finnish elementari school student grader studi show high success rate automat map fixat line text read map defer success rate map compar obtain earlier studi data collect min initi calibr low sampl hz remot eye tracker laboratori set high sampl rate tracker result provid solid basi develop system classroom learn environ provid automat support read share data group learner teacher group make approach learn read comprehens skill",0

Interest is growing in this type of stimulus for research in neuroscience. This interest stems from the advantage of separating the component of pure human action kinematics from other pictorial information, such as facial expression and muscle contraction. Although several groups have previously developed datasets of human point-light actions, due to the lack of datasets composed of daily actions with short durations, we developed 20 biological and 40 control (scrambled) point-light movements by using the technique of recording people wearing reflector patches. The videos are about 1 s long. Subsequently, we performed a judgment task in which 100 participants (50 male and 50 female) evaluated each video according to three categories: human action resemblance, performed action, and gender of actor. We present the mean scores of each evaluation for each video, and further propose a selection of the most suitable videos to be used as human point-light action displays and scrambled point-light displays for control.

"KeywordsInteraction effects Mixed models Additive mixed models Regression splines Non-parametric curve estimation ","on the ambiguity of interaction and nonlinear main effects in a regime of dependent covariates","The analysis of large experimental datasets frequently reveals significant interactions that are difficult to interpret within the theoretical framework guiding the research. Some of these interactions actually arise from the presence of unspecified nonlinear main effects and statistically dependent covariates in the statistical model. Importantly, such nonlinear main effects may be compatible (or, at least, not incompatible) with the current theoretical framework. In the present literature, this issue has only been studied in terms of correlated (linearly dependent) covariates. Here we generalize to nonlinear main effects (i.e., main effects of arbitrary shape) and dependent covariates. We propose a novel nonparametric method to test for ambiguous interactions where present parametric methods fail. We illustrate the method with a set of simulations and with reanalyses (a) of effects of parental education on their children’s educational expectations and (b) of effects of word properties on fixation locations during reading of natural sentences, specifically of effects of length and morphological complexity of the word to be fixated next.

It is unique in supporting binocular data analysis for unicode, proportional, and nonproportional fonts and spaced and unspaced scripts. Consequently, it is well suited for research on a wide range of writing systems. To date, it has been used with English, German, Thai, Korean, and Chinese.

"KeywordsNonverbal behavior Gesture Annotation Coding system Analysis tool Reliability ","the revised neurogeselan system an objective and reliable interdisciplinary analysis tool for nonverbal behavior and gesture","As visual media spread to all domains of public and scientific life, nonverbal behavior is taking its place as an important form of communication alongside the written and spoken word. An objective and reliable method of analysis for hand movement behavior and gesture is therefore currently required in various scientific disciplines, including psychology, medicine, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, and computer science. However, no adequate common methodological standards have been developed thus far. Many behavioral gesture-coding systems lack objectivity and reliability, and automated methods that register specific movement parameters often fail to show validity with regard to psychological and social functions. To address these deficits, we have combined two methods, an elaborated behavioral coding system and an annotation tool for video and audio data. The NEUROGES–ELAN system is an effective and user-friendly research tool for the analysis of hand movement behavior, including gesture, self-touch, shifts, and actions. Since its first publication in 2009 in Behavior Research Methods, the tool has been used in interdisciplinary research projects to analyze a total of 467 individuals from different cultures, including subjects with mental disease and brain damage. Partly on the basis of new insights from these studies, the system has been revised methodologically and conceptually. The article presents the revised version of the system, including a detailed study of reliability. The improved reproducibility of the revised version makes NEUROGES–ELAN a suitable system for basic empirical research into the relation between hand movement behavior and gesture and cognitive, emotional, and interactive processes and for the development of automated movement behavior recognition methods.","Behavior Research Methods",2016,"No","nonverb behavior gestur annot code system analysi tool reliabl revis neurogeselan system object reliabl interdisciplinari analysi tool nonverb behavior gestur visual media spread domain public scientif life nonverb behavior take place import form communic alongsid written spoken word object reliabl method analysi hand movement behavior gestur requir scientif disciplin includ psycholog medicin linguist anthropolog sociolog comput scienc adequ common methodolog standard develop behavior gestur code system lack object reliabl autom method regist specif movement paramet fail show valid regard psycholog social function address deficit combin method elabor behavior code system annot tool video audio data neurog elan system effect user friend research tool analysi hand movement behavior includ gestur touch shift action public behavior research method tool interdisciplinari research project analyz total individu cultur includ subject mental diseas brain damag part basi insight studi system revis methodolog conceptu articl present revis version system includ detail studi reliabl improv reproduc revis version make neurog elan suitabl system basic empir research relat hand movement behavior gestur cognit emot interact process develop autom movement behavior recognit method",0

The capacity coefficient is a function across time that provides a useful measure of this construct. Until now, most analyses of the capacity coefficient have focused on the magnitude of this function, and often only in terms of a qualitative comparison (greater than or less than one). This work explains how a functional extension of principal components analysis can capture the time-extended information of these functional data, using a small number of scalar values chosen to emphasize the variance between participants and conditions.

However, such a pupillary effect may be due to the process of executing a response, instead of being an index of word processing. With the aim of exploring this possibility, we recorded the pupillary responses in two experiments involving a lexical decision task (LDT). In the first experiment, participants completed a standard LDT, whereas in the second they performed a delayed LDT. The delay in the response allowed us to compare pupil dilations with and without the response execution component. The results showed that pupillary response was modulated by word frequency in both the standard and the delayed LDT. This finding supports the reliability of using pupillometry for word recognition research. Importantly, our results also suggest that tasks that do not require a response during pupil recording lead to clearer and stronger effects.","Behavior Research Methods",2017,"No","visual word recognit pupillometri lexic decis task delay lexic decis task word frequenc effect pupillari respons reliabl index word recognit evid delay lexic decis task previous word recognit studi shown pupillari respons sensit word frequenc pupillari effect due process execut respons index word process aim explor possibl record pupillari respons experi involv lexic decis task ldt experi particip complet standard ldt perform delay ldt delay respons allow compar pupil dilat respons execut compon result show pupillari respons modul word frequenc standard delay ldt find support reliabl pupillometri word recognit research import result suggest task requir respons pupil record lead clearer stronger effect",0

Factor analysis revealed low-demand, non-functional tasks formed one factor (“Voluntary Talkativeness”), while higher demand tasks formed a second factor (“Speech Ability”). This finding and examination of relationships with IQ, personality and gender indicate “Voluntary Talkativeness” is not wholly accounted for by verbal ability, and is only weakly related to self-reported personality.

To obtain an adequate diagnosis, it is often necessary to record the EEG for several hours or several days. A computer system was developed to perform data reduction and quantification by continuously monitoring seizures and automatically recognizing interictal spikes and sharp waves. The past 2 min of EEG are kept on the computer disk at every instant. When an epileptic seizure occurs or when a spike is detected, a sample of EEG, including a section preceding the event itself, is written on the EEG polygraph and on magnetic tape. A continuous recording is thus replaced by samples of varying lengths, containing only the important aspects of the EEG, reducing considerably the original data. After the monitoring session, the spatial and temporal distributions of the interictal activity are presented in a quantified form on the terminal. The seizures are recorded on digital tape and are available for several types of processing.

These variables include choices of sampling parameters, auto- and cross-spectral algorithms, smoothing techniques, and use of the γ2(f) or γ(f) value for coherence. These variables in the analysis itself have a net interactive effect on the calculated results that often makes comparability of data across studies impossible. Thus, it is proposed that studies include a graph showing the authors’ derived coherence values for a set of standard test signals to enhance scientific communication.","Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation",1981,"No","coher phase angl power spectral densiti dyslex child smooth techniqu user interact graphic base comput system analysi eeg comput technolog power high resolut tool analysi understand electroencephalogram eeg system user interact graphic base comput program analyz power spectral densiti psd coher phase angl relationship eeg mathemat algorithm analyt variabl inher coher analysi review variabl includ choic sampl paramet auto cross spectral algorithm smooth techniqu coher variabl analysi net interact effect calcul result make compar data studi imposs propos studi includ graph show author deriv coher valu set standard test signal enhanc scientif communic",0
"KeywordsDigital Filter Filter Coefficient Vestibular Nystagmus Kaiser Window Ideal Transfer Function ","application of digital filters in the processing of eye movement data","Digital filter techniques have been applied to the analysis of eye movement data. Methods were developed to calculate eye velocity and eye acceleration in real-time from an electronystag-mogram (ENG) signal that was recorded using a one-pole RC high-pass filter in the preamplifier. Nonrecursive, finite impulse-response digital filters were designed to remove the effects of the RC high-pass filter and calculate the first and second time derivatives of the ENG signal, as well as remove high-frequency noise. Applying these new techniques to the analysis of vestibular nystagmus enables estimation of the transfer characteristics of the vestibuloocular system.","Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation",1982,"No","digit filter filter coeffici vestibular nystagmus kaiser window ideal transfer function applic digit filter process eye movement data digit filter techniqu appli analysi eye movement data method develop calcul eye veloc eye acceler real time electronystag mogram eng signal record pole rc high pass filter preamplifi nonrecurs finit impuls respons digit filter design remov effect rc high pass filter calcul time deriv eng signal remov high frequenc nois appli techniqu analysi vestibular nystagmus enabl estim transfer characterist vestibuloocular system",0
"KeywordsCognitive Test Impulse Control Complex Attention Sine Tracking Standard Neuropsychological Test ","performance in normal subjects on a novel battery of driving related sensory motor and cognitive tests","Currently, there is no international standard for the assessment of fitness to drive for cognitively or physically impaired persons. A computerized battery of driving-related sensory-motor and cognitive tests (SMCTests) has been developed, comprising tests of visuoperception, visuomotor ability, complex attention, visual search, decision making, impulse control, planning, and divided attention. Construct validity analysis was conducted in 60 normal, healthy subjects and showed that, overall, the novel cognitive tests assessed cognitive functions similar to a set of standard neuropsychological tests. The novel tests were found to have greater perceived face validity for predicting on-road driving ability than was found in the equivalent standard tests. Test—retest stability and reliability of SMCTests measures, as well as correlations between SMCTests and on-road driving, were determined in a subset of 12 subjects. The majority of test measures were stable and reliable across two sessions, and significant correlations were found between on-road driving scores and measures from ballistic movement, footbrake reaction, hand-control reaction, and complex attention. The substantial face validity, construct validity, stability, and reliability of SMCTests, together with the battery’s level of correlation with on-road driving in normal subjects, strengthen our confidence in the ability of SMCTests to detect and identify sensory-motor and cognitive deficits related to unsafe driving and increased risk of accidents.","Behavior Research Methods",2009,"No","cognit test impuls control complex attent sine track standard neuropsycholog test perform normal subject batteri drive relat sensori motor cognit test intern standard assess fit drive cognit physic impair person computer batteri drive relat sensori motor cognit test smctest develop compris test visuopercept visuomotor abil complex attent visual search decis make impuls control plan divid attent construct valid analysi conduct normal healthi subject show cognit test assess cognit function similar set standard neuropsycholog test test found greater perceiv face valid predict road drive abil found equival standard test test retest stabil reliabl smctest measur correl smctest road drive determin subset subject major test measur stabl reliabl session signific correl found road drive score measur ballist movement footbrak reaction hand control reaction complex attent substanti face valid construct valid stabil reliabl smctest batteri level correl road drive normal subject strengthen confid abil smctest detect identifi sensori motor cognit deficit relat unsaf drive increas risk accid",0

"KeywordsSpeech Signal Acoustic Measure Acoustic Analysis Speech Sample Small Business Innovation Research ","standardization of pitch range settings in voice acoustic analysis","Voice acoustic analysis is typically a labor-intensive, time-consuming process that requires the application of idiosyncratic parameters tailored to individual aspects of the speech signal. Such processes limit the efficiency and utility of voice analysis in clinical practice as well as in applied research and development. In the present study, we analyzed 1,120 voice files, using standard techniques (case-by-case hand analysis), taking roughly 10 work weeks of personnel time to complete. The results were compared with the analytic output of several automated analysis scripts that made use of preset pitch-range parameters. After pitch windows were selected to appropriately account for sex differences, the automated analysis scripts reduced processing time of the 1,120 speech samples to less than 2.5 h and produced results comparable to those obtained with hand analysis. However, caution should be exercised when applying the suggested preset values to pathological voice populations.","Behavior Research Methods",2009,"No","speech signal acoust measur acoust analysi speech sampl small busi innov research standard pitch rang set voic acoust analysi voic acoust analysi typic labor intens time consum process requir applic idiosyncrat paramet tailor individu aspect speech signal process limit effici util voic analysi clinic practic appli research develop present studi analyz voic file standard techniqu case case hand analysi take rough work week personnel time complet result compar analyt output autom analysi script made preset pitch rang paramet pitch window select appropri account sex differ autom analysi script reduc process time speech sampl produc result compar obtain hand analysi caution exercis appli suggest preset valu patholog voic popul",0

The cigarette holder contains both smoke-mixing and flow-measurement orifices and a smoke-concentration sensor. Smoke flow through the holder and smoke concentration in the holder are determined simultaneously. The two signals are multiplied electronically and the product signal integrated. The integrated response is directly proportional to the amount of particulate matter collected immediately downstream of the holder, regardless of cigarette type or the particular way in which the cigarette is smoked. The CSM is sufficiently sensitive to quantitatively determine the amount of smoke TPM generated from cigarettes in the 1-mg Federal Trade Commission tar-delivery category.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",1984,"No","nicotin smoke feder trade commiss total particul matter puff volum instrument cigarett smoke monitor design direct measur smoke particul matter generat human smoke studi instrument cigarett smoke monitor csm system design human smoke studi develop valid smoke machin human surrog cigarett holder smoke mix flow measur orific smoke concentr sensor smoke flow holder smoke concentr holder determin simultan signal multipli electron product signal integr integr respons direct proport amount particul matter collect immedi downstream holder cigarett type cigarett smoke csm suffici sensit quantit determin amount smoke tpm generat cigarett mg feder trade commiss tar deliveri categori",0

Key elements were content created by experts, high-quality video segments, satellite-based interaction, off-line interactions among teams of parents and caregivers, workshops, and team building exercises. For pragmatic reasons, it was necessary to develop brief assessment instruments concurrently with training. A large set of survey items were created from draft materials and reduced empirically through piloting to those with the best psychometric properties. To avoid the appearance of traditional testing, knowledge was assessed with Likert items. Surveys measured participant satisfaction, knowledge, attitudes, and the application and articulation of concepts. Participant satisfaction was high. Participants increased positive attitudes and learned appropriate vocabulary. Training was more effective than no training or watching videotapes. The program appears to represent a viable model of training that could successfully be applied to Internet technologies.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",1999,"No","video segment team build particip satisfact likert item signific posit chang assess win team program interact satellit base train research assess interact satellit base train program integr interact audiovisu experi face face interact key element content creat expert high qualiti video segment satellit base interact line interact team parent caregiv workshop team build exercis pragmat reason develop assess instrument concurr train larg set survey item creat draft materi reduc empir pilot psychometr properti avoid appear tradit test knowledg assess likert item survey measur particip satisfact knowledg attitud applic articul concept particip satisfact high particip increas posit attitud learn vocabulari train effect train watch videotap program appear repres viabl model train success appli internet technolog",0

Presented are the SLOT communication task and the software and hardware that has been developed to run SLOT experiments and record the participants’ multimodal behavior. SLOT offers a high level of flexibility in varying the context of the communication and is particularly useful in studies of the relationship between pen gestures and speech. We illustrate the use of the SLOT platform by discussing the results of some early experiments. The first is an experiment on negotiation with a one-way mirror between the participants, and the second is an exploratory study of automatic recognition of spontaneous pen gestures. The results of these studies demonstrate the usefulness of the SLOT platform for conducting multimodal communication research in both human-human and human-computer interactions.","Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers",2003,"No","visual modal graphic tablet slot data negoti time multimod communic slot research platform investig multimod communic articl present spatial logist task slot platform investig multimod communic human particip present slot communic task softwar hardwar develop run slot experi record particip multimod behavior slot offer high level flexibl vari context communic studi relationship pen gestur speech illustr slot platform discuss result earli experi experi negoti mirror particip exploratori studi automat recognit spontan pen gestur result studi demonstr use slot platform conduct multimod communic research human human human comput interact",0
"KeywordsReadability Multilevel Linguistic features Support vector machine Validity ","constructing and validating readability models the method of integrating multilevel linguistic features with machine learning","Multilevel linguistic features have been proposed for discourse analysis, but there have been few applications of multilevel linguistic features to readability models and also few validations of such models. Most traditional readability formulae are based on generalized linear models (GLMs; e.g., discriminant analysis and multiple regression), but these models have to comply with certain statistical assumptions about data properties and include all of the data in formulae construction without pruning the outliers in advance. The use of such readability formulae tends to produce a low text classification accuracy, while using a support vector machine (SVM) in machine learning can enhance the classification outcome. The present study constructed readability models by integrating multilevel linguistic features with SVM, which is more appropriate for text classification. Taking the Chinese language as an example, this study developed 31 linguistic features as the predicting variables at the word, semantic, syntax, and cohesion levels, with grade levels of texts as the criterion variable. The study compared four types of readability models by integrating unilevel and multilevel linguistic features with GLMs and an SVM. The results indicate that adopting a multilevel approach in readability analysis provides a better representation of the complexities of both texts and the reading comprehension process.","Behavior Research Methods",2015,"No","readabl multilevel linguist featur support vector machin valid construct valid readabl model method integr multilevel linguist featur machin learn multilevel linguist featur propos discours analysi applic multilevel linguist featur readabl model valid model tradit readabl formula base general linear model glms discrimin analysi multipl regress model compli statist assumpt data properti includ data formula construct prune outlier advanc readabl formula produc low text classif accuraci support vector machin svm machin learn enhanc classif outcom present studi construct readabl model integr multilevel linguist featur svm text classif take chines languag studi develop linguist featur predict variabl word semant syntax cohes level grade level text criterion variabl studi compar type readabl model integr unilevel multilevel linguist featur glms svm result adopt multilevel approach readabl analysi represent complex text read comprehens process",0
"KeywordsTone monitoring Processing load Position effect ERPs Wrap-up ","disentangling perceptual and psycholinguistic factors in syntactic processing tone monitoring via erps","Franco, Gaillard, Cleeremans, and Destrebecqz (Behavior Research Methods, 47, 1393–1403, 2015), in a study on statistical learning employing the click-detection paradigm, conclude that more needs to be known about how this paradigm interacts with statistical learning and speech perception. Past results with this monitoring technique have pointed to an end-of-clause effect in parsing—a structural effect—but we here show that the issues are a bit more nuanced. Firstly, we report two Experiments (1a and 1b), which show that reaction times (RTs) are affected by two factors: (a) processing load, resulting in a tendency for RTs to decrease across a sentence, and (b) a perceptual effect which adds to this tendency and moreover helps neutralize differences between sentences with slightly different structures. These two factors are then successfully discriminated by registering event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during a monitoring task, with Experiment 2 establishing that the amplitudes of the N1 and P3 components—the first associated with temporal uncertainty, the second with processing load in dual tasks—correlate with RTs. Finally, Experiment 3 behaviorally segregates the two factors by placing the last tone at the end of sentences, activating a wrap-up operation and thereby both disrupting the decreasing tendency and highlighting structural effects. Our overall results suggest that much care needs to be employed in designing click-detection tasks if structural effects are sought, and some of the now-classic data need to be reconsidered.","Behavior Research Methods",2018,"No","tone monitor process load posit effect erp wrap disentangl perceptu psycholinguist factor syntact process tone monitor erp franco gaillard cleereman destrebecqz behavior research method studi statist learn employ click detect paradigm conclud paradigm interact statist learn speech percept past result monitor techniqu point end claus effect pars structur effect show issu bit nuanc first report experi a b show reaction time rts affect factor process load result tendenc rts decreas sentenc perceptu effect add tendenc help neutral differ sentenc slight structur factor success discrimin regist event relat brain potenti erp monitor task experi establish amplitud n p compon tempor uncertainti process load dual task correl rts final experi behavior segreg factor place tone end sentenc activ wrap oper disrupt decreas tendenc highlight structur effect result suggest care employ design click detect task structur effect sought classic data reconsid",0
