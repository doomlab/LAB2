# LAB2
Update to the Linguistic Annotated Bibliography

- Last work through of sources was November 4th, 2019.

# Workflow

## The `Sources` Folder

First, update all relevant search files, which are stored in the `input_data` folder:

- `lab_table.csv`: The current version of the LAB table, which is also stored in our shiny app folder.
- `mendeley.bib`: A bibtex file that includes all the LAB citations, which is also stored in our shiny app folder. 

Searches: 

To do these searches, we used "" to keep like terms together to avoid articles that only used `norms` or `lexical` when appropriate. 

- `lexical_DB_*.csv/bib`: The search term "lexical database" on source websites.
- `linguistic_DB_*.csv/bib`: The search term "linguistic database" on source websites. 
- `lexical_norms_*.csv/bib`: The search term "lexical norms" on source websites.
- `linguistic_norms_*.csv/bib`: The search term "linguistic norms" on source websites. 
- `corpus_*.csv/bib`: The search term "corpus" only on journal websites.
- `norms_*.csv/bib`: The search term "norms" only on journal websites.

Websites and journals currently used:
- EBSCO host for PSYCInfo
- PLoS One
- Behavior Research Methods
- Language Resources and Evaluation 

Second, run the data creation script:

- `data_creation.Rmd`: This file creates the data for examination in the project. Run this file to update to the newest datasets.
