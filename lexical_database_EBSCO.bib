Abstract = {The Lesser Sunda Islands in eastern Indonesia cover a longitudinal distance of some 600 kilometres. They are the westernmost place where languages of the Austronesian family come into contact with a family of Papuan languages and constitute an area of high linguistic diversity. Despite its diversity, the Lesser Sundas are little studied and for most of the region, written historical records, as well as archaeological and ethnographic data are lacking. In such circumstances the study of relationships between languages through their lexicon is a unique tool for making inferences about human (pre-)history and tracing population movements. However, the lack of a collective body of lexical data has severely limited our understanding of the history of the languages and peoples in the Lesser Sundas. The LexiRumah database fills this gap by assembling lexicons of Lesser Sunda languages from published and unpublished sources, and making those lexicons available online in a consistent format. T)},

Abstract = {Presents a study which aims to investigate SPALEX, a Spanish lexical decision database by focusing on native Spanish speakers at a global scale and with a vast amount of words, to provide a useful tool for researchers exploring the acquisition and processing of this language in native and foreign contexts. SPALEX contains data from a Spanish crowd-sourced lexical decision mega study. The authors collected the data through an online platform from May 12th, 2014 to December 19th, 2017. The majority of the data was acquired during the first month of the experiment, when an advertising campaign was done in order to attract the public’s attention. Participants also had the option of publishing their results via social networks, which led to attract more participants in a snow-ball sampling fashion. Additionally, the database contains information on participants that voluntarily provided information about their gender, age, country of origin, education level, handedness, native language, and best foreign language. In each experimental session, participants responded to 70 words and 30 non-words presented randomly and without repetition. Accuracy in SPALEX is expressed as 1 for correct answers and 0 for incorrect answers. Based on participants’ responses, the authors calculated percentage known, a measure of the percentage of participants that know a particular word.

To obtain these metrics, researchers can choose between two word queries in the application: (i) analyze words previously selected for specific attributes and/or lexical and sublexical characteristics, or (ii) generate word lists that meet word requirements defined by the user in the menu of analyses. For the measures it provides and the flexibility it allows, P-PAL will be a key resource to support research in all cognitive areas that use EP verbal stimuli.

In the last ten years, a number of lexical databases have been developed for Greek. However, these lack important part-of-speech information. Furthermore, the need for alternative procedures for calculating syllabic measurements and stress information, as well as combination of several metrics to investigate linguistic properties of the Greek language are highlighted. To address these issues, we present a new extensive lexical database of Modern Greek (GreekLex 2) with part-of-speech information for each word and accurate syllabification and orthographic information predictive of stress, as well as several measurements of word similarity and phonetic information.

Abstract = {This article presents K-SPAN (Korean Surface Phonetics and Neighborhoods), a database of surface phonetic forms and several measures of phonological neighborhood density for 63,836 Korean words. Currently publicly available Korean corpora are limited by the fact that they only provide orthographic representations in Hangeul, which is problematic since phonetic forms in Korean cannot be reliably predicted from orthographic forms. We describe the method used to derive the surface phonetic forms from a publicly available orthographic corpus of Korean, and report on several statistics calculated using this database; namely, segment unigram frequencies, which are compared to previously reported results, along with segment-based and syllable-based neighborhood density statistics for three types of representation: an 'orthographic' form, which is a quasi-phonological representation, a 'conservative' form, which maintains all known contrasts, and a 'modern' form, which represents the pronunciation of contemporary Seoul Korean. These representations are rendered in an ASCII-encoded scheme, which allows users to query the corpus without having to read Korean orthography, and permits the calculation of a wide range of phonological measures.

But computing the semantic similarity/relatedness of geographic terminology is still an urgent issue to tackle. The thesaurus is a ubiquitous and sophisticated knowledge representation tool existing in various domains. In this article, we combined the generic lexical database (WordNet or HowNet) with the Thesaurus for Geographic Science and proposed a thesaurus-lexical relatedness measure (TLRM) to compute the semantic relatedness of geographic terminology. This measure quantified the relationship between terminologies, interlinked the discrete term trees by using the generic lexical database and realized the semantic relatedness computation of any two terminologies in the thesaurus.

One of its uses is to facilitate the searching process of models in the repository. Business process similarity is closely related to semantic string similarity.

The activity name of the business process uses terms that specifically related to the business field. However, most of the terms in business domain are not available in WordNet. This case would decrease the semantic analysis quality of business process model. Therefore, this study would try to improve semantic analysis of business process model.

Abstract = {Research into lexical retrieval requires pictorial stimuli standardised for key psycholinguistic variables. Such databases exist in a number of languages but not in Arabic. In addition there are few studies of the effects of psycholinguistic and morpho-syntactic variables on Arabic lexical retrieval. The current study identified a set of culturally and linguistically appropriate concept labels, and corresponding photographic representations for Levantine Arabic. The set included masculine and feminine nouns, nouns from both types of plural formation (sound and broken), and both rational and irrational nouns. Levantine Arabic speakers provided norms for visual complexity, imageability, age of acquisition, naming latency and name agreement. This delivered a normative database for a set of 186 Arabic nouns. The effects of the morpho-syntactic and the psycholinguistic variables on lexical retrieval were explored using the database. Imageability and age of acquisition were the only significant determinants of successful lexical retrieval in Arabic. None of the other variables, including all the linguistic variables, had any effect on production time. The normative database is available for the use of clinicians and researchers in the Arab world in the domains of speech and language pathology, neurolinguistics and psycholinguistics. The database and the photographic representations will be soon available for free download from the first author's personal webpage or via email.},

Like other children’s grade-level databases (e.g., Carroll, Davies, & Richman, 1971; Corral, Ferrero, & Goikoetxea, Behavior Research Methods, 41, 1009–1017, 2009; Lété, Sprenger-Charolles, & Colé, Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers, 36, 156–166, 2004; Zeno, Ivens, Millard, Duvvuri, 1995), ESCOLEX provides four frequency indices for each grade: overall word frequency (F), index of dispersion across the selected textbooks (D), estimated frequency per million words (U), and standard frequency index (SFI). It also provides a new measure, contextual diversity (CD). In addition, the number of letters in the word and its part(s) of speech, number of syllables, syllable structure, and adult frequencies taken from P-PAL (a European Portuguese corpus-based lexical database; Soares, Comesaña, Iriarte, Almeida, Simões, Costa, …, Machado, 2010; Soares, Iriarte, Almeida, Simões, Costa, França, …, Comesaña, in press) are provided.

Abstract = {A widely agreed-upon feature of spoken word recognition is that multiple lexical candidates in memory are simultaneously activated in parallel when a listener hears a word, and that those candidates compete for recognition (Luce, Goldinger, Auer, & Vitevitch, Perception 62:615–625, 2000; Luce & Pisoni, Ear and Hearing 19:1–36, 1998; McClelland & Elman, Cognitive Psychology 18:1–86, 1986). Because the presence of those competitors influences word recognition, much research has sought to quantify the processes of lexical competition. Metrics that quantify lexical competition continuously are more effective predictors of auditory and visual (lipread) spoken word recognition than are the categorical metrics traditionally used (Feld & Sommers, Speech Communication 53:220–228, 2011; Strand & Sommers, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 130:1663–1672, 2011). A limitation of the continuous metrics is that they are somewhat computationally cumbersome and require access to existing speech databases. This article describes the Phi-square Lexical Competition Database (Phi-Lex): an online, searchable database that provides access to multiple metrics of auditory and visual (lipread) lexical competition for English words, available at www.juliastrand.com/phi-lex.

Abstract = {All words have properties linked to form, meaning and usage patterns which influence how easily they are accessed from the mental lexicon in language production, perception and comprehension. Examples of such properties are imageability, phonological and morphological complexity, word class, argument structure, frequency of use and age of acquisition. Due to linguistic and cultural variation the properties and the values associated with them differ across languages. Hence, for research as well as clinical purposes, language specific information on lexical properties is needed. To meet this need, an electronically searchable lexical database with more than 1600 Norwegian words coded for more than 12 different properties has been established. This article presents the content and structure of the database as well as the search options available in the interface. Finally, it briefly describes some of the ways in which the database can be used in research, clinical practice and teaching. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In an auditory lexical decision experiment, 5541 spoken content words and pseudowords were presented to 20 native speakers of Dutch. The words vary in phonological make-up and in number of syllables and stress pattern, and are further representative of the native Dutch vocabulary in that most are morphologically complex, comprising two stems or one stem plus derivational and inflectional suffixes, with inflections representing both regular and irregular paradigms; the pseudowords were matched in these respects to the real words. The BALDEY ('biggest auditory lexical decision experiment yet') data file includes response times and accuracy rates, with for each item morphological information plus phonological and acoustic information derived from automatic phonemic segmentation of the stimuli. Two initial analyses illustrate how this data set can be used. First, we discuss several measures of the point at which a word has no further neighbours and compare the degree to which each measure predicts our lexical decision response outcomes. Second, we investigate how well four different measures of frequency of occurrence (from written corpora, spoken corpora, subtitles, and frequency ratings by 75 participants) predict the same outcomes. These analyses motivate general conclusions about the auditory lexical decision task. The (publicly available) BALDEY database lends itself to many further analyses.

Abstract = {This paper describes the evolution of a lexical resource project for Nxa?amxcín, an endangered Salish language, from the project's inception in the 1990s, based on legacy materials recorded in the 1960s and 1970s, to its current form as an online database that is transformable into various print and web-based formats for varying uses. We illustrate how we are using TEI P5 for data-encoding and archiving and show that TEI is a mature, reliable, flexible standard which is a valuable tool for lexical and morphological markup and for the production of lexical resources. Lexical resource creation, as is the case with language documentation and description more generally, benefits from portability and thus from conformance to standards (Bird and Simons 2003, Thieberger 2011). This paper therefore also discusses standards-harmonization, focusing on our attempt to achieve interoperability in format and terminology between our database and standards proposed for LMF, RELISH and GOLD. We show that, while it is possible to achieve interoperability, ultimately it is difficult to do so convincingly, thus raising questions about what conformance to standards means in practice.},

Abstract = {In this article we introduce childLex, an online database for children’s print language in German. childLex is based on a large corpus of children’s books and textbooks used in school that comprises ca. 8 million words. It includes linguistic norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level. Such norms are urgently needed in psychological research for the design of age-adequate stimulus and training materials. Separate norms are available for three age groups: 6–8 years (1st and 2nd grade), 9–10 years (3rd and 4th grade), and 11–12 years (5th and 6th grade). Moreover, childLex is directly comparable to the DWDS corpus, a large corpus for adults’ print language. Here, we describe how childLex was collected and analyzed and compare frequency norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level with frequency norms obtained from the DWDS corpus. Results show moderate levels of correspondence in the high-frequency range and on the sub-lexical level, but strong discrepancies for medium- and low-frequency elements on the lexical and super-lexical level. Finally, we illustrate which variables are available in childLex and how they can be retrieved using a web interface. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The processing of human and nonhuman concepts (e.g., agreeable vs. edible) during basic comprehension and reasoning tasks has become a major topic of scientific inquiry. To ensure that the experimental effects obtained from such studies reflect the hypothesised semantic distinction, potential confounds such as psycholinguistic and/or lexical properties of the exact stimuli chosen need to be addressed. In the current study, normative data of such properties were obtained for a series of 875 French adjectives by asking 8 groups of 20 participants to each rate all words on one dimension of theoretical interest. The collected ratings indicate the extent to which each adjective evokes a sensory experience (concreteness), captures an enduring attribute (temporal stability), refers to a visible characteristic (visibility), denotes a neutral or an affectively laden concept (valence), signifies an attribute of low or high intensity, is familiar to the reader and can be used to describe people )},

Abstract = {Malay, a language spoken by 250 million people, has a shallow alphabetic orthography, simple syllable structures, and transparent affixation—characteristics that contrast sharply with those of English. In the present article, we first compare the letter–phoneme and letter–syllable ratios for a sample of alphabetic orthographies to highlight the importance of separating language-specific from language-universal reading processes. Then, in order to develop a better understanding of word recognition in orthographies with more consistent mappings to phonology than English, we compiled a database of lexical variables (letter length, syllable length, phoneme length, morpheme length, word frequency, orthographic and phonological neighborhood sizes, and orthographic and phonological Levenshtein distances) for 9,592 Malay words. Separate hierarchical regression analyses for Malay and English revealed how the consistency of orthography–phonology mappings selectively modulates the effects of different lexical variables on lexical decision and speeded pronunciation performance.

Abstract = {In this paper we develop a formalization of semantic relations that facilitates efficient implementations of relations in lexical databases or knowledge representation systems using bases. The formalization of relations is based on a modeling of hierarchical relations in Formal Concept Analysis. Further, relations are analyzed according to Relational Concept Analysis, which allows a representation of semantic relations consisting of relational components and quantificational tags. This representation utilizes mathematical properties of semantic relations. The quantificational tags imply inheritance rules among semantic relations that can be used to check the consistency of relations and to reduce the redundancy in implementations by storing only the basis elements of semantic relations. The research presented in this paper is an example of an application of Relational Concept Analysis to lexical databases and knowledge representation systems (cf.

Abstract = {This paper presents an overview of a project that aims at creating a representative catalogue of crosslinguistically recurring semantic shifts in the languages of the world and at implementing this catalogue in the form of a searchable computer database. Such a catalogue is useful in several theoretical and methodological respects. First of all, both universal and language-specific semantic shifts can be considered a window onto human cognitive mechanisms operative in the domain of linguistic conceptualization. Second, the catalogue provides a rich empirical basis for the study of genetic and areal tendencies in semantic change, as well as in polysemy patterns. Another potential application is historical reconstruction, since the catalogue gives evidence for attested paths of diachronic semantic evolution. In Section 1 we outline the general concept of the catalogue of semantic shifts. Section 2 describes the design of the computer database. In Section 3 we discuss some difficulties that we have faced while working on the catalogue. The next three sections demonstrate how the catalogue can be used in linguistic research and present an analysis of three selected issues, namely semantic shifts in the domain of dimension (Section 4), motivation strategies in the domain of folk biology (Section 5), and euphemization as a mechanism of semantic change (Section 6).

Abstract = {The LEXIN database offers psycholinguistic indexes of the 13,184 different words (types) computed from 178,839 occurrences of these words (tokens) contained in a corpus of 134 beginning readers widely used in Spain. This database provides four statistical indicators: F (overall word frequency), D (index of dispersion across selected readers), U (estimated frequency per million words), and SFI (standard frequency index). It also gives information about the number of letters, syntactic category, and syllabic structure of the words included. To facilitate comparisons, LEXIN provides data from LEXESP’s (Sebastián-Gallés, Martí, Cuetos, & Carreiras, 2000), Alameda and Cuetos’s (1995), and Martínez and García’s (2004) Spanish adult psycholinguistic frequency databases. Access to the LEXIN database is facilitated by a computer program. The LEXIN program allows for the creation of word lists by letting the user specify searching criteria. LEXIN can be useful for researchers in cognitive psychology, particularly in the areas of psycholinguistics and education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this article, we present a new lexical database for French: Lexique. In addition to classical word information such as gender, number, and grammatical category, Lexique includes a series of interesting new characteristics. First, word frequencies are based on two cues: a contemporary corpus of texts and the number of Web pages containing the word. Second, the database is split into a graphemic table with all the relevant frequencies, a table structured around lemmas (particularly interesting for the study of the inflectional family), and a table about surface frequency cues. Third, Lexique is distributed under a GNU-like license, allowing people to contribute to it. Finally, a metasearch engine, Open Lexique, has been developed so that new databases can be added very easily to the existing ones. Lexique can either be downloaded or interrogated freely from http://www.lexique.org. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Several studies on auditory word recognition indicate that word processing is influenced by phonological similarity with other words. We describe a lexical database, VoColex, which provides several statistical indexes of phonological similarity between French words. Phonological similarity is computed according to two distinct principles. According to the first principle, phonologically similar words share initial phonemes with the target word. According to the second principle, phonological neighbours correspond to any words which can be derived from the target by a single phoneme change (substitution, addition, or deletion) whatever the position of the modified phoneme. The statistical data provided by VoCoLex allow the control and the empirical manipulation of various measures of phonological similarity, as well as quantitative descriptions of the auditory lexicon.

Abstract = {The article focuses on WordNet, an online lexical database designed for use under program control. WordNet database links English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs to sets of synonyms that are in turn linked through semantic relations that determine word definitions. On WordNet, a form is represented by a string of ASCII characters and a sense is represented by the set of one or more synonyms that have that sense. It contains more than 118,000 different word forms and more than 90,000 different word senses. Approximately 17% of the words in WordNet are polysemous and approximately 40% have one or more synonyms. It lists the alternatives from which choices must be made. WordNet would be much more useful if incorporated the means for determining appropriate senses, allowing the program to evaluate the contexts in which words are used. Choosing between alternative senses of a polysemous word is a matter of distinguishing between different sets of linguistic contexts in which the word form can be used to express the world sense.},

Word frequencies are provided for four levels: first grade (G1), second grade (G2), third to fifth grades (G3-5), and all grades (Gl-5). The frequencies were computed following the methods described by Carroll, Davies, and Richman (1971) and Zeno, Ivenz, Millard, and Duvvuri (1995), with four statistics at each level (F, overall word frequency; D, index of dispersion across the selected readers; U, estimated frequency per million words; and SFI, standard frequency index). The database also provides the number of letters in the word and syntactic category information. MANULEX is intended to be a useful tool for studying language development through the selection of stimuli based on precise frequency norms. Researchers in artificial intelligence can also use it as a source of information on natural language processing to simulate written language acquisition in children. Finally, it may serve an educational purpose by providing basic vocabulary lists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This paper describes the characteristics of lexicographic software programs used in a module on Alexander Pope's "The Rape of the Lock," a major component of a course on computer-assisted learning (CAL) at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Two of the databases are specific to that school and are small, individualized, and frequently adapted in response to student request. The other is the New Oxford English Dictionary (NOED), which is being developed jointly by Oxford University Press and the University of Waterloo. At the time of this study, the only segment of NOED available for use was the alphabetical range of M through Moonless. This became a prototype of one of three sources of research for students using the CAL module, the other two being a bibliography and a  lexicon specific to an understanding of terms in the context of Pope's work. The NOED has a projected 500,000 main headwords, 2.2 million citations, and 425,000 cross-references, and cannot be altered or annotated. Because accessing and managing the information from an unrestricted dictionary of this size can be intimidating for the naive user (i.e., the student), the two smaller database systems were assimilated into files extracted from NOED which are easily modifiable by instructors. Also discussed are questions about defining user need, the sophistication level of users, and awareness, and the overall effectiveness of lexical materials. (SD)},

This system constitutes one of the two main disambiguation subsystems that are responsible for the morphological disambiguation of the corpora of synchronic Czech within the Czech National Corpus project. We will show that although the part of texts constituted by collocations/phrasemes (generally multiword expressions - MWEs) is relatively small and consequently the errorfree morphological disambiguation of MWEs covers only a small portion of textual material, such perfectly disambiguated fragments in sentences help to improve the disambiguation of the rest, non-MWE part of sentences.

Based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, every single word is related to a set of topics with different weight. The weights are further estimated in order to determine the semantic relation between the words and the rest of the documents. Apparently the chief drawback of topic modeling techniques, specifically LDA, lies on their incapability in clustering short texts in which semantic relation between words is neglected. This issue is deemed more severe when analyzing social networks such as Twitter wherein short texts are the case. It is assumed that semantic relation between a document and the target short text helps obtain efficient clustering of short texts via topic modeling.

Abstract = {Okazaki and Nitta (2005) developed an e-learning program called PLIMA (your Personal LIstening Manager) which focuses on improving poor phonological analysis such as the inability to hear liaison or unstressed sounds. However, the fact remains that there are certain types of liaison sounds that learners do not catch, and some types they do. This means if we specify what type, in other words, what level of liaison sounds they cannot catch, that will help PLIMA offer more effective learning to learners who lack certain listening skills. To automatically determine the difficulty levels of the English audio materials, text evaluation techniques using lexical databases have been employed in many cases so far. However, automatic judging systems on the difficulty levels of the English audio materials themselves, not using lexical databases, are almost unseen. In this paper, we are going to propose a listening difficulty level determination system, to overcome such a challenging task. It applies a processing technique to extract the acoustic feature quantities that are employed in speech recognition engines. [For full proceedings, see ED565087.]},

Abstract = {Studies of context effects in speech production have shown that semantic feature overlap produces interference in naming of categorically related objects. In neuroimaging studies, this semantic interference effect is consistently associated with involvement of left superior and middle temporal gyri. However, at least part of this effect has recently been shown to be attributable to visual form similarity, as categorically related objects typically share visual features. This fMRI study examined interference produced by visual form overlap in the absence of a category relation in a picture–word interference paradigm. Both visually similar and visually dissimilar distractors led to increased BOLD responses in the left inferior frontal gyrus compared with the congruent condition. Naming pictures in context with a distractor word denoting an object visually similar in form slowed RTs compared with unrelated words and was associated with reduced activity in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. This area is reliably observed in lexical level processing during language production tasks. No significant differential activity was observed in areas typically engaged by early perceptual or conceptual feature level processing or in areas proposed to be engaged by postlexical language processes, suggesting that visual form interference does not arise from uncertainty or confusion during perceptual or conceptual identification or after lexical processing. We conclude that visual form interference has a lexical locus, consistent with the predictions of competitive lexical selection models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

The present study examined foveal load effects on parafoveal processing in natural Chinese reading. Parafoveal preview of a single-character parafoveal target word was manipulated by using the boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975; pseudocharacter or identity previews) under high foveal load (low-frequency pretarget word) compared with low foveal load (high-frequency pretarget word) conditions. Despite an effective manipulation of foveal processing load, we obtained no evidence of any modulatory influence on parafoveal processing in first-pass reading times. However, our results clearly showed that saccadic targeting, in relation to forward saccade length from the pretarget word and in relation to target word skipping, was influenced by foveal load and this influence occurred independent of parafoveal preview. Given the optimal experimental conditions, these results provide very strong evidence that)},

Abstract = {The aim of this longitudinal study is to evaluate 3 views on the relationship between nonword repetition and vocabulary: (i) the storage-based view that considers nonword repetition, a measure of phonological storage, as the driving force behind vocabulary development, (ii) the lexical restructuring view that considers improvements in nonword repetition as the result of vocabulary growth, and (iii) the 'combined' view that assumes that both storage-based learning and lexical restructuring play a role, resulting in reciprocal relationships between nonword repetition and vocabulary during language development. Data are analyzed from 471 monolingual Dutch children who performed tasks assessing nonword repetition and vocabulary at yearly intervals, from ages 2 to 5. Latent Change Score (LCS) modeling of Item Response Theory-scaled scores was used to investigate the relationships between nonword repetition and vocabulary growth over time. Additionally, the statistical techniques used in earlier work—cross-lagged and latent growth modeling—were applied to see whether the results changed as a function of the analytical technique used. Results from a bivariate LCS model showed positive reciprocal influences from nonword repetition on vocabulary between 2 and 5 years. Such positive cross-influences also emerged from the cross-lagged and latent growth models. Predictive relationships from vocabulary to nonword repetition were stronger than vice versa. These results indicate that both storage-based learning and lexical restructuring play a role in vocabulary learning, at least in early stages of language development, with the clearest support found for lexical restructuring.

Abstract = {Interactive models of language production predict that it should be possible to observe long-distance interactions; effects that arise at one level of processing influence multiple subsequent stages of representation and processing. We examine the hypothesis that disruptions arising in nonform-based levels of planning—specifically, lexical selection—should modulate articulatory processing. A novel automatic phonetic analysis method was used to examine productions in a paradigm yielding both general disruptions to formulation processes and, more specifically, overt errors during lexical selection. This analysis method allowed us to examine articulatory disruptions at multiple levels of analysis, from whole words to individual segments. Baseline performance by young adults was contrasted with young speakers’ performance under time pressure (which previous work has argued increases interaction between planning and articulation) and performance by older adults (who may have difficulties inhibiting nontarget representations, leading to heightened interactive effects). The results revealed the presence of interactive effects. Our new analysis techniques revealed these effects were strongest in initial portions of responses, suggesting that speech is initiated as soon as the first segment has been planned. Interactive effects did not increase under response pressure, suggesting interaction between planning and articulation is relatively fixed. Unexpectedly, lexical selection disruptions appeared to yield some degree of facilitation in articulatory processing (possibly reflecting semantic facilitation of target retrieval) and older adults showed weaker, not stronger interactive effects (possibly reflecting weakened connections between lexical and form-level representations).

Abstract = {In this study, we conducted a lexical decision test using masked priming paradigm to examine the morphological and orthographic priming effects in word recognition. Morphologically related word pairs can be derivational, sharing the same root or not (pseudo derivational). However, the orthographically related pairs share the same letters in different positions. Two groups of native Arabic-speaking children (N = 57) from grade 4 and 5 participated in this study: typical readers (n = 39) and dyslexic readers (n = 18). To examine whether a potential morphological priming effect is driven by semantic or orthographic properties of shared morphemes, we compared prime-target pairs with derivation morphology and pseudo-derivation word related pairs. Between groups comparisons showed that a priming effect occurred only in typical readers. Comparisons between conditions revealed that a priming effect only occurred for accuracy in derivational morphology. No priming effect occurred in reaction times (RTs) between groups or conditions. These results provide evidence for root-based word recognition in Arabic children and give support to semantically rather than orthographically driven lexical access.

Abstract = {This study examines second language (L2) reading by individuals with a Chinese or Korean native literacy (L1) background. It tests a hypothesis about the L1-L2 transfer of word reading procedures, which predicts that Chinese-English (CE) bilinguals transfer a bias towards lexical reading procedures and holistic orthographic coding to L2 English reading, whereas Korean-English (KE) bilinguals transfer a bias towards sublexical reading procedures and analytic orthographic coding. To test this hypothesis, we gave a word naming task to CE and KE groups matched on English language experience and use. The stimuli were English words that varied in frequency and orthographic-phonological consistency, and pronounceable English nonwords. Items were presented in an upright or inverted orientation. The CE bilinguals exhibited slower naming latencies, especially for inverted stimuli. Further, the effects of inversion interacted differently with frequency and consistency across the two groups, with CE bilinguals more sensitive to frequency and KE bilinguals more sensitive to consistency. Group differences in naming accuracy were also observed, even when differences in reading skill were taken into account. Overall, these findings provide evidence for L1-L2 transfer of word reading procedures and demonstrate that stimulus inversion can unmask individual differences in reading style. More generally, they indicate that both lexical and sublexical procedures can support skilled English reading, though the pace of reading development will likely be poorer for readers biased towards lexical reading procedures.

Abstract = {Background Students with intellectual disabilities (IDs) have various learning difficulties and are at risk for school failure. Large inter‐individual differences are described for reading, but it is unclear how these vary as a function of grade. The aim of this study was to examine various reading fluency, accuracy and comprehension parameters in second‐to‐eighth‐grade Italian children with either borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) or mild ID (MID). Methods We examined 106 children with BIF (67 M and 39 F) and 168 children with MID (107 M and 61 F). The children were in the second to eighth grade and were comparable for chronological age (7 to 14 years). They were administered a battery of tests that assessed fluency and accuracy of word, pseudo‐word and text reading, as well as text comprehension. Standardised scores allowed us to compare the performance of the two groups with normative values. Results Children with ID obtained generally low scores compared with normative values. Those with MID had greater difficulty than those with BIF. Furthermore, difficulty was greater for speed than for accuracy measures and for words than for pseudo‐words. Difficulty (particularly in the case of reading speed) tended to be pronounced at later grades. Marked individual differences were present independently of MID–BIF subgrouping, as well as stimulus category and reading parameter. Conclusions As a group, children with ID showed difficulty in reading acquisition; the effect was greater for children with more severe ID, but large individual differences were observed in children with both BIF and MID. Relatively spared pseudo‐word reading skills indicate efficient use of the grapheme‐to‐phoneme conversion routine. This processing mode may prove more ineffective at higher levels of schooling when even in regular orthographies such as Italian typically developing children rely on lexical activation.

Abstract = {Heterogeneous effects of semantic distance in language production have sparked a debate on the central assumption of many language production models, namely that lexical selection is a competitive process. In the present ERP study, we manipulated semantic distance in the picture word interference (PWI) paradigm systematically within taxonomic hierarchies. Target–distractor pairs were either closely related members of the same basic level category, hence sharing many semantic features (e.g., orangutan and gorilla), or distantly related members of the same superordinate category, sharing fewer features (e.g., orangutan and horse). Across related conditions, broad category membership (e.g., animals) was kept constant. Naming times reflected a systematic increase of semantic interference as semantic distance decreased. Early and later ERP modulations related to the semantic distance manipulation were observed at posterior regions starting at 234 ms and with an additional fronto-central cluster starting at 346 ms. Early effects are interpreted as indexing lexical selection while the late effects may reflect an N400-like component. Taking the behavioral and ERP modulations together, these results are in line with models of lexical selection that include an early competitive lexical selection process.

Abstract = {Punctuated equilibrium theory (PET) suggests that the policy process is characterized by long periods of incremental change and short periods of punctuated change. The impetus for the latter is usually a focusing event that breaks open policy monopolies, allowing for major changes in legislative decision making. While a burgeoning body of literature, a shortcoming in the PET literature is that it has yet to explain why focusing events and subsequent breakdowns in policy monopolies sometimes fail to result in punctuated policy. We integrate theories on cultural change with punctuated equilibrium to explain why focusing events do not always result in the dramatic policy changes that we might expect. Specifically, we use the context of national energy policy and the lexical database, Google Ngram Viewer, to trace punctuating energy-related events and the occurrence or lack thereof subsequent policy change from 1952 to 2000.

Abstract = {Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) is a thriving national sign language used by tens of thousands of signers in Kenya, and which emerged out of two deaf schools in western Kenya in the early 1960s. In this thesis, I provide a thorough description and analysis of the basic phonological components of the KSL lexicon used in the southwestern region of Kenya (formerly south Nyanza Province). This phonological grammar of (SoNy)KSL makes contributions in three domains. In the descriptive domain, it provides a thorough report of the basic units in the main phonological parameters; i.e., Handshape (Ch. 4), Location (Ch. 5), and Movement (Ch 6, 7), as well as the evidence for the distinctiveness of each unit. The description for Movement and Location are particularly noteworthy because those parameters have received less attention in sign linguistics in general compared to Handshape. In the methodological domain, the grammar is based on a KSL Lexical Database built for this project, in which over 50 phonetic characteristics of 1,880 non-compound signs were coded. This database is currently one of only a few such richly coded lexical databases of sign languages. In addition, this grammar employs a rigorous approach to determining lexical contrast, which has yielded a separate dataset of 461 minimal pairs (Ch. 3). This dataset is unique in sign linguistics and reveals patterns of lexical contrast that were not previously known--and which have generated new hypotheses about how lexical contrast may be constrained by degrees of visual similarity. Finally, this thesis makes a theoretical contribution by comparing how different models of sign phonology can account for sign types in KSL. By evaluating the explanatory power of the main theories of sign phonology on the basis of specific descriptive data, this thesis gives unique insights into the theoretical validity of these models. It also proposes modifications in some cases, especially with regard to how the Dependency Model (DPM) can account for the representation of movement features and their relationship to the timing tier. In addition, a new movement feature, [dispersed], is described and its implementation worked out in the DPM.

In this paper, we address the problem of semantic-aware querying and provide a general framework for modeling and processing semantic-based keyword queries in textual databases, i.e., considering the lexical and semantic similarities/disparities when matching user query and data index terms.

Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD), which involves the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia, has long been associated with motor deficits. Increasing evidence suggests that language can also be impaired, including aspects of syntactic and lexical processing. However, the exact pattern of these impairments remains somewhat unclear, for several reasons. Few studies have examined and compared syntactic and lexical processing within subjects, so their relative deficits remain to be elucidated. Studies have focused on earlier stages of PD, so syntactic and lexical processing in later stages are less well understood. Research has largely probed English and a handful of other European languages, and it is unclear whether findings generalize more broadly. Finally, few studies have examined links between syntactic/lexical impairments and their neurocognitive substrates, such as measures of basal ganglia degeneration or dopaminergic processes. We addressed these gaps by investigating multiple aspects of Farsi syntactic and lexical processing in 40 Farsi native-speaking moderate-to-severe non-demented PD patients, and 40 healthy controls. Analyses revealed equivalent impairments of syntactic comprehension and syntactic judgment, across different syntactic structures. Lexical processing was impaired only for motor function-related objects (e.g., naming ‘hammer’, but not ‘mountain’), in line with findings of PD deficits at naming action verbs as compared to objects, without the verb/noun confound. In direct comparisons between lexical and syntactic tasks, patients were better at naming words like ‘mountain’ (but not words like ‘hammer’) than at syntactic comprehension and syntactic judgment. Performance at syntactic comprehension correlated with the last levodopa equivalent dose. No other correlations were found between syntactic/lexical processing measures and either levodopa equivalent dose or hypokinesia, which reflects degeneration of basal ganglia motor-related circuits. All critical significant main effects, interactions, and correlations yielded large effect sizes. The findings elucidate the nature of syntactic and lexical processing impairments in PD.

Abstract = {The ability to use visual speech cues does not fully develop until late adolescence. The cognitive and neural processes underlying this slow maturation are not yet understood. We examined electrophysiological responses of younger (8–9 years) and older (11–12 years) children as well as adults elicited by visually perceived articulations in an audiovisual word matching task and related them to the amount of benefit gained during a speech-in-noise (SIN) perception task when seeing the talker’s face. On each trial, participants first heard a word and, after a short pause, saw a speaker silently articulate a word. In half of the trials the articulated word matched the auditory word (congruent trials), whereas in the other half it did not (incongruent trials). In all three age groups, incongruent articulations elicited the N400 component and congruent articulations elicited the late positive complex (LPC). Groups did not differ in the mean amplitude of N400. The mean amplitude of LPC was larger in younger children compared with older children and adults. Importantly, the relationship between event-related potential measures and SIN performance varied by group. In 8- and 9-year-olds, neither component was predictive of SIN gain. The LPC amplitude predicted the SIN gain in older children but not in adults. Conversely, the N400 amplitude predicted the SIN gain in adults. We argue that although all groups were able to detect correspondences between auditory and visual word onsets at the phonemic/syllabic level, only adults could use this information for lexical access.

Abstract = {Language understanding requires the integration of the input with preceding context. Event-related potentials (ERPs) have contributed significantly to our understanding of what contextual information is accessed and when. Much of this research has, however, been limited to experimenter-designed stimuli with highly atypical lexical and context statistics. This raises questions about the extent to which previous findings generalise to everyday language processing of natural stimuli with typical linguistic statistics. We ask whether context can affect ERPs over natural stimuli early before the N400 time window. We re-analyse a data set of ERPs over ∼700 visually presented content words in sentences from English novels. To increase power, we employ trial-level ms-by-ms linear mixed-effects regression simultaneously modelling random variance by subject and by item. To reduce concerns about Type I error inflation common to time series analyses, we introduce a simple approach to model and discount auto-correlations at multiple, empirically determined, time lags. We compare this approach to Bonferroni correction. Planned follow-up analyses employ Generalized Additive Mixed Models to assess the linearity of contextual effects, including lexical surprisal, within the N400 time window. We found that contextual information affects ERPs in both early (∼200 ms after word onset) and late (N400) time windows, in line with a cascading, interactive account of lexical access.

Abstract = {The study aimed to explore the effect of group dynamic assessment on word learning through lexical inferencing and to compare it to that of vocabulary enhancement exercises. Through purposive sampling, 45 intermediate EFL learners were selected as participants and randomly assigned to three groups. The participants read six texts over a 6-day period and answered comprehension questions for each text. In the second phase of each treatment session, the first group engaged in lexical inferencing of the underlined words within group dynamic assessment framework. The second group did two vocabulary exercises for each target word. The third group engaged in lexical inferencing of target words through group dynamic assessment framework and also did one vocabulary exercise for each target word. Vocabulary Knowledge Scale (Wesche and Paribakht in Can Mod Lang Rev 53:13–40, 1996) was used to measure learners’ knowledge of the target words 1 day prior to the treatment and 1 day and 28 days after the treatment. The results showed that in terms of gains in depth and size of vocabulary knowledge the first and the second groups were not significantly different. However, the third group significantly outperformed the first and the second groups. It was concluded that group dynamic assessment is as effective as vocabulary exercises in enhancing word learning through lexical inferencing and that the combination of group dynamic assessment and vocabulary exercises could enhance word learning through lexical inferencing even more.

Abstract = {One of the strategies that researchers have used to investigate the role of sensorimotor information in lexical–semantic processing is to examine the effects of words’ rated body–object interaction (BOI; i.e., the ease with which the human body can interact with a word’s referent). Processing tends to be facilitated for words with high as compared with low BOI, across a wide variety of tasks. Such effects have been referenced in debates over the nature of semantic representations, but their theoretical import has been limited by the fact that BOI is a fairly coarse measure of sensorimotor experience with words’ referents. In the present study, we collected ratings for 621 words on seven semantic dimensions (graspability, ease of pantomime, number of actions, animacy, size, danger, and usefulness), in order to investigate which attributes are most strongly related to BOI ratings and to lexical–semantic processing. BOI ratings were obtained from previous norming studies (Bennett, Burnett, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 43, 1100–1109, 2011; Tillotson, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 40, 1075–1078, 2008), and measures of lexical–semantic processing were obtained from previous behavioral megastudies involving either the semantic categorization task (concrete/abstract decision; Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017) or the lexical decision task (Balota et al., Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007). The results showed that the motor dimensions of graspability, ease of pantomime, and number of actions were all related to BOI, and that these dimensions together explained more variance in semantic processing than did the BOI ratings alone. These ratings will be useful for researchers who wish to study how different kinds of bodily interactions influence lexical–semantic processing and cognition.

Abstract = {Listeners resolve ambiguities in speech perception using multiple sources, including non-local or distal speech rate (i.e., the speech rate of material surrounding a particular region). The ability to resolve ambiguities is particularly important for the perception of casual, everyday productions, which are often produced using phonetically reduced forms. Here, we examine whether the distal speech rate effect is specific to a lexical class of words and/or to particular lexical or phonological contexts. In Experiment 1, we examined whether distal speech rate influenced perception of phonologically similar content words differing in number of syllables (e.g., form/forum). In Experiment 2, we used both transcription and word-monitoring tasks to examine whether distal speech rate influenced perception of a reduced vowel, causing lexical reorganization (e.g., cease, see us). Distal speech rate influenced perception of lexical content in both experiments. This demonstrates that distal rate influences perception of a lexical class other than function words and affects perception in a variety of phonological and lexical contexts. These results support a view that distal speech rate is a pervasive source of information with far-reaching consequences for perception of lexical content and word segmentation.

Abstract = {Repetition blindness (RB) is the inability to detect both instances of a repeated stimulus during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Prior work has demonstrated RB for semantically related critical items presented as pictures, but not for word stimuli. It is not known whether the type of semantic relationship between critical items (i.e., conceptual similarity or lexical association) determines the manifestation of semantically mediated RB, or how this is affected by the format of the stimuli. These questions provided the motivation for the present study. Participants reported items presented in picture or word RSVP streams in which critical items were either low-associate category coordinates (horse–camel), high-associate noncoordinates (horse–saddle), or unrelated word pairs (horse–umbrella). Report accuracy was reduced for category coordinate critical items only when they were presented in pictorial form; accuracy for coordinate word pairs did not differ from that of their unrelated counterparts. Associated critical items were reported more accurately than unrelated critical items in both the picture and word versions of the task. We suggest that semantic RB for pictorial stimuli results from intracategory interference in the visuosemantic space; words do not reliably suffer from semantic RB because they do not necessitate semantic mediation to be reported successfully. Conversely, the associative facilitation observed in both picture and word versions of the task reflects the spread of activation between the representations of associates in the lexical network.

Abstract = {It was previously shown that words representing living things are better remembered than those representing nonliving things. Here we address the influence of animacy on novel word memory formation in adults, dissecting its effect on semantic and orthographic learning. Participants received training on a set of new picture-name-description mappings corresponding to animate or inanimate items, simulating word learning in the first language. The integration of novel words was indexed in a semantic judgment task, performed at 30 min or 48 h after learning. Results show that novel word forms and meanings corresponding to animate items are better recalled than inanimate ones. In addition, animate items are processed faster than inanimate items in a semantic judgment task 30 min after learning, while the speed advantage is not evident in the long-term. Thus, animacy is a pervasive memory enhancer during novel word acquisition but its effects on lexical processing are short-lived. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Vowel harmony is a linguistic phenomenon whereby vowels within a word share one or several of their phonological features, constituting a nonadjacent, and thus challenging, dependency to learn. It can be found in a large number of agglutinating languages, such as Hungarian and Turkish, and it may apply both at the lexical level (i.e., within word stems) and at the morphological level (i.e., between stems and their affixes). Thus, it might affect both lexical and morphological development in infants whose native language has vowel harmony. The current study asked at what age infants learning an irregular harmonic language, Hungarian, become sensitive to vowel harmony within word stems. In a head-turn preference study, 13-month-old, but not 10-month-old, Hungarian-learning infants preferred listening to nonharmonic VCV (vowel–consonant–vowel) pseudowords over vowel-harmonic ones. A control experiment with 13-month-olds exposed to French, a nonharmonic language, showed no listening preference for either of the sequences, suggesting that this finding cannot be explained by a universal preference for nonharmonic sequences but rather reflects language-specific knowledge emerging between 10 and 13 months of age. We discuss the implications of this finding for morphological and lexical learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The current study explored whether the metaphorical meaning of novel words can be learned and how the metaphorical meaning was acquired during contextual reading. The novel words were embedded in two types of learning contexts: one supported the metaphorical meaning (metaphorical meaning learning condition: ML condition), and the other supported the literal meaning (literal meaning learning condition: LL condition). The learning effect was assessed via a semantic-relatedness judgment task with event-related potentials (ERPs) being recorded. In this task, the novel words served as primes, the literal corresponding concepts of the novel words (CC), the metaphorically related words (MR) and unrelated words (NR) served as targets. The results showed that the N400 amplitudes in response to the targets varied as a function of targets type in a graded manner increasing from the CC targets, to the MR targets, and to the NR targets in both learning conditions over the lateral electrodes. Furthermore, over the midline electrodes, the N400 difference between the CC and MR targets was gone in the ML condition; the N400 effect between the MR and NR targets was absent in the LL condition. These results suggested that learners could get the metaphorical meaning of newly learned words, and this process was influenced by the learning contexts. The study broadens our understanding on the learning of the lexical meaning of words. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Rapid automatized naming (RAN) of visual items is a powerful predictor of reading skills. However, the direction and locus of the association between RAN and reading is still largely unclear. Here, we investigated whether literacy acquisition directly bolsters RAN efficiency for objects, adopting a strong methodological design, by testing three groups of adults matched in age and socioeconomic variables, who differed only in literacy/schooling: unschooled illiterate and ex‐illiterate, and schooled literate adults. To investigate in a fine‐grained manner whether and how literacy facilitates lexical retrieval, we orthogonally manipulated the word‐form frequency (high vs. low) and phonological neighborhood density (dense vs. spare) of the objects' names. We observed that literacy experience enhances the automaticity with which visual stimuli (e.g., objects) can be retrieved and named: relative to readers (ex‐illiterate and literate), illiterate adults performed worse on RAN. Crucially, the group difference was exacerbated and significant only for those items that were of low frequency and from sparse neighborhoods. These results thus suggest that, regardless of schooling and age at which literacy was acquired, learning to read facilitates the access to and retrieval of phonological representations, especially of difficult lexical items.

Abstract = {The present study investigated how lexical selection is influenced by the number of semantically related representations (semantic neighbourhood density) and their similarity (semantic distance) to the target in a speeded picture-naming task. Semantic neighbourhood density and similarity as continuous variables were used to assess lexical selection for which competitive and noncompetitive mechanisms have been proposed. Previous studies found mixed effects of semantic neighbourhood variables, leaving this issue unresolved. Here, we demonstrate interference of semantic neighbourhood similarity with less accurate naming responses and a higher likelihood of producing semantic errors and omissions over accurate responses for words with semantically more similar (closer) neighbours. No main effect of semantic neighbourhood density and no interaction between semantic neighbourhood density and similarity was found. We assessed further whether semantic neighbourhood density can affect naming performance if semantic neighbours exceed a certain degree of semantic similarity. Semantic similarity between the target and each neighbour was used to split semantic neighbourhood density into two different density variables: The number of semantically close neighbours versus distant neighbours. The results showed a significant effect of close, but not of distant, semantic neighbourhood density: Naming pictures of targets with more close semantic neighbours led to longer naming latencies, less accurate responses, and a higher likelihood for the production of semantic errors and omissions over accurate responses. The results show that word inherent semantic attributes such as semantic neighbourhood similarity and the number of coactivated close semantic neighbours modulate lexical selection supporting theories of competitive lexical processing.

Abstract = {Part of learning a language includes determining what variation is meaningful and what variation is not meaningful. This dissertation presents a series of artificial language learning experiments to provide a timeline of early phonological acquisition in naive adult learners. The core contribution of this dissertation is to propose a domain-general, two-stage model of distributional learning consisting of a Bias Stage followed by a Sensitivity Stage. Additionally, this dissertation will explore the relation that distributional learning holds with three factors, attention, environmental context, and lexical acquisition. Chapter 3 presents a set of experiments to make the core argument that distributional learning occurs in two stages. It is argued that the underlying mechanism behind distributional learning is not to directly warp the learner's perceptual space, contrary to models which have been proposed. Chapter 3 will also examine the role of attention and its relation to distributional learning. Chapter 4 presents an experiment which investigates the relationship between environmental context and distributional learning. Results of this experiment will be used to support a one-stage model of allophony acquisition. Chapter 5 presents a set of experiments which explore the disparity between distributional learning and lexical acquisition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was twofold: first, to obtain a neuropsychological characterization of children with language disorders, and second, to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program on working memory. We used a pretest-instruction–posttest design, carefully identifying a sample of 32 children with language disorders whom we then evaluated for short-term verbal and visuospatial memory, verbal and visuospatial working memory, attention, processing speed, and lexical-semantic skills. We then implemented an intervention program on working memory consisting of 72 sessions of 15 minutes each, after which we repeated the neuropsychological assessment of these functions. Children with language disorders performed worse than children in the control group in all memory tasks evaluated and in the lexical-semantic processing task. After the intervention, children with language disorders showed a significant increase over their own previous performance in all variables. Children with language disorders show significant cognitive deficits and not just linguistic impairment. We offer conclusive findings on the effectiveness of the intervention program used. Finally, we obtained partial support for the existence of a causal link between improved performance on memory tasks and performance in a lexical-semantic task.

Abstract = {Research in the past few decades has generally supported a nonselective view of bilingual lexical access where a bilinguals' two languages are both active during monolingual processing. However, recent work by Costa et al., 2016, has brought this into question by reinterpreting evidence for nonselectivity in a selective manner: bilinguals are capable of activating their target language without simultaneous activation of the nontarget language due to the bilingual organization of the second language (L2) during learning. This dissertation manipulated the factor of first language (L1) attrition in two event-related potential (ERP) experiments to disentangle Costa and colleague's selective processing proposal versus the traditional nonselective processing view of bilingual lexical access. In Experiment 1, Spanish-English bilinguals demonstrated an N400 effect of L1 attrition during implicit L1 processing in an L2 semantic judgment task, indicating the contribution of variable L1 lexical access during L2 processing. A follow-up experiment indicated that this effect was due to L1 lexical properties, confirming the presence of L1 processing during L2 processing. These results are incompatible with Costa and colleagues' selective view, adding to the literature supporting a nonselective view of bilingual lexical access.

Abstract = {Word frequency is an important predictor of lexical-decision task performance. The current study further examined the role of this variable by exploring the influence of frequency trajectory. Frequency trajectory is measured by how often a word occurs in childhood relative to adulthood. Past research on the role of this variable in word recognition has produced equivocal results. In the current study, words were selected based on their frequencies in Grade 1 (child frequency) and Grade 13 (college frequency). In Experiment 1, four frequency trajectory conditions were factorially examined in a lexical-decision task with English words: high-to-high (world), high-to-low (uncle), low-to-high (brain) and low-to-low (opera). an interaction between Grade 1 and college frequency demonstrated that words in the low-to-high condition were processed significantly faster and more accurately than words in the low-to-low condition, whereas the high-to-high and high-to-low conditions did not differ significantly. In Experiment 2, an advantage for words with an increasing frequency trajectory was also supported in regression analyses on both lexical decision and naming times for 3,039 items selected from the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007). This was replicated in Experiment 3, based on a regression analysis of 2,680 words from the British Lexicon Project (BLP; Keuleers, Lacey, Rastle, & Brysbaert, 2012). In all analyses, rated age-of-acquisition also significantly impacted word recognition. Together, the results suggest that the age at which a word is initially learned as well as its frequency trajectory across childhood impact performance in the lexical-decision task.

Abstract = {Plagiarism takes place when we use any person’s work without giving due acknowledgment. There are several fields where the text similarity is involved like web document retrieval, information mining, and searching related articles. Several approaches have been introduced for detecting plagiarism in the text documents based on the syntactic structure of the text, string similarity, fingerprinting, semantic meaning underlying the text, etc. The basic limitation of plagiarism detection systems these days is that they fail to detect tough cases of plagiarism. The proposed plagiarism detection approach is the hybrid of semantic and syntactic similarity between the text documents. This novel approach exploits linguistic information sources non-linearly using the lexical database for finding the relatedness between text documents. The proposed approach uses semantic knowledge to perform cognitive-inspired computing. The framework is capable of detecting intelligent plagiarism cases like a verbatim copy, paraphrasing, rewording in a sentence, and sentence transformation. The approach has been evaluated on the standard PAN-PC-11 dataset. The experiments show that our technique has outperformed other strong baseline techniques in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and plagiarism detection (PlagDet) score.

As in the case of the Princeton wordnet, the African wordnet groups African language words into sets of synonyms along with short definitions and usage examples, as well as records relations between synonyms. This article examines a number of synsets in order to identify the word-formation processes used by various linguists in constructing the AWN. Since the English Princeton wordnet was used as the basis for the lexical database in the creation of the African wordnet, various word-formation strategies had to be used to account for lexical items that are not lexicalised in the African languages. Access to the created synsets was gained via a web browser, which is an automated text analysis application. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR], Copyright of Southern African Lingui)},

Abstract = {Background: Curious parallels between the processes of species and language evolution have been observed by many researchers. Retracing the evolution of Indo-European (IE) languages remains one of the most intriguing intellectual challenges in historical linguistics. Most of the IE language studies use the traditional phylogenetic tree model to represent the evolution of natural languages, thus not taking into account reticulate evolutionary events, such as language hybridization and word borrowing which can be associated with species hybridization and horizontal gene transfer, respectively. More recently, implicit evolutionary networks, such as split graphs and minimal lateral networks, have been used to account for reticulate evolution in linguistics. Results: Striking parallels existing between the evolution of species and natural languages allowed us to apply three computational biology methods for reconstruction of phylogenetic networks to model the evolution of IE languages.

Abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate the time course of syllabic and sub-syllabic encoding in Cantonese Chinese spoken word production using the picture-word interference task with concurrent recording of event-related brain potential (ERP) signals. Cantonese-speaking participants were asked to name aloud individually presented pictures and ignore an accompanying auditory word distractor. Participants’ naming responses were faster, relative to an unrelated control, when the target (e.g. /gu2/, meaning 'drum') was presented together with a distractor sharing the same atonal syllable (e.g. /gu3/), or syllable body (e.g. /gung1/). More importantly, the ERP effects associated with syllable-related priming appeared earlier than those associated with body-related priming. The earlier effects of syllable-related priming relative to body-related priming indicate that syllable retrieval precedes sub-syllabic specification in Cantonese phonological encoding, consistent with the proximate unit hypothesis that the nature of the proximate phonological unit (i.e. the first selectable phonological unit following lexical access) is language dependent.

Abstract = {Previous research suggests that meaningful gestures in the absence of speech (i.e. pantomimed gestures) influence lexical processing, but, the extent to which pantomimes affect word retrieval is poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between pantomimes and action verb retrieval. Across two experiments, we showed that naming an action picture with a verb was facilitated by the observation of a congruent gesture, relative to both an unrelated gesture and a neutral stimulus which did not differ in their effects. Priming effects were also found to be affected by gesture transparency. This study provides the first demonstration of cross-modal gesture priming of verb retrieval in picture naming. We suggest that facilitation of verb retrieval from pantomimed gestures is consistent with priming at either the semantic level or lexical level.

Abstract = {In stroke-induced aphasia, left hemispheric lesions generally disturb the word production network. The left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the left middle temporal gyrus (LMTG) are involved in word production, but their respective contribution remains ambiguous. Previous investigations have largely focused on semantic interference to gather information about word production. Here we assessed the sensitivity of twenty-five aphasic speakers with either LIFG or LMTG lesions and matched controls to both semantic facilitation and interference in word production using the picture-word (PWP) and the blocked-cyclic naming (BCNP) paradigms. In the PWP (Exp. 1), semantic facilitation was exaggerated in participants with LIFG damage as compared to age-matched controls. In the BCNP (Exp. 2), repetition priming on production speed was larger in participants with LMTG damage than in controls, without any decrease of semantic errors. In the light of the results in the PWP, the LIFG appears to be a necessary structure to shape semantic facilitation. It might play an important role in properly adjusting the lexical selection threshold within the word production network. The results in the BCNP suggest that the LMTG conveys semantic-to-lexical connections likely involved in repetition priming and in mapping concepts to their correct lexical label. As consequences, participants with LIFG lesions possibly rely more on strategic vs automatic processes to efficiently select lexical entries in semantically competitive contexts, whereas participants with LMTG might exploit residual semantic-to-lexical activation.

Abstract = {Leading neural models of visual word recognition assume that letter rotation slows down the conversion of the visual input to a stable orthographic representation (e.g., local detectors combination model; Dehaene, Cohen, Sigman, & Vinckier, 2005, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9, 335–341). If this premise is true, briefly presented rotated primes should be less effective at activating word representations than those primes with upright letters. To test this question, we conducted a masked priming lexical decision experiment with vertically presented words either rotated 90° or in marquee format (i.e., vertically but with upright letters). We examined the impact of the format on both letter identity (masked identity priming: identity vs. unrelated) and letter position (masked transposed-letter priming: transposed-letter prime vs. replacement-letter prime). Results revealed sizeable masked identity and transposed-letter priming effects that were similar in magnitude for rotated and marquee words. Therefore, the reading cost from letter rotation does not arise in the initial access to orthographic/lexical representations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Phonological similarity affects bilingual lexical access of etymologically-related translation equivalents (ETEs). Jinan Mandarin (JM) and Standard Chinese (SC) are closely related and share many ETEs, which are usually orthographically and segmentally identical but vary in tonal similarity. Using an auditory lexical decision experiment and Generalised Additive Modelling, the present study investigates how cross-linguistic tonal similarity interacts with language of operation and how the switching of language across blocks influences SC-JM bilinguals’ auditory lexical processing of ETEs. Bilinguals showed a language dominance effect, indicating that ETEs are specified with separated word-form representations. Compared with SC tonal monolinguals, bilinguals showed a discontinuous bilingual auditory lexical advantage, instead of a classical bilingual lexical disadvantage. The dynamic role of cross-linguistic tonal similarity in auditory word processing is discussed in light of the bilinguals’ attentional shift with the change of language mode at the pre-lexical and lexical stages.

Abstract = {Traditional models of neural reorganization of language skills in patients with chronic stroke-induced aphasia (PWA) propose activation of reperfused or spared left hemisphere tissue results in the most favorable language outcomes. However, these models do not fully explain variable behavioral recovery patterns observed in chronic patients. Instead, investigation of connectivity patterns of critical network nodes may elucidate better-informed recovery models. In the present study, we combined fMRI and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to examine effective connectivity of a simple three-node left hemisphere network during a semantic feature decision task in 25 PWA and 18 age-matched neurologically intact healthy controls. The DCM model space utilized in Meier, Kapse, & Kiran (2016), which was organized according to exogenous input to one of three regions (i.e., left inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis [LIFGtri], left posterior middle temporal gyrus [LpMTG], or left middle frontal gyrus [LMFG]) implicated in various levels of lexical-semantic processing, was interrogated. This model space included all possible combinations of uni- and bidirectional task-modulated connections between LIFGtri, LMFG and LpMTG, resulting in 72 individual models that were partitioned into three separate families (i.e., Family #1: Input to LIFGtri, Family #2: Input to LMFG, Family #3: Input to LpMTG). Family-wise Bayesian model selection revealed Family #2: Input to LMFG best fit both patient and control data at a group level. Both groups relied heavily on LMFG's modulation of the other two model regions. By contrast, between-group differences in task-modulated coupling of LIFGtri and LpMTG were observed. Within the patient group, the strength of activity in LIFGtri and connectivity of LpMTG → LIFGtri were positively associated with lexical-semantic abilities inside and outside of the scanner, whereas greater recruitment of LpMTG was associated with poorer lexical-semantic skills.

Abstract = {Speakers show syntactic priming—that is, a tendency to repeat syntactic constructions they have recently comprehended or produced—and this tendency is even stronger when adjacent utterances share the same main verb, termed the lexical boost. Some have suggested that abstract syntactic priming (i.e., with no lexical overlap) derives from implicit learning, whereas the lexical boost derives from explicit short-term memory (STM) for the prime (e.g., Chang, Dell, & Bock, 2006). To address this issue, we assessed twelve people with aphasia (PWA) with varying degrees of STM and language deficits and eleven age-matched healthy control speakers in a syntactic priming experiment. Despite the PWA's difficulty in maintaining phonological, semantic, and structural information, as evidenced by various STM and sentence repetition measures, they showed lexical boost effects comparable to those of healthy speakers. Moreover, the size of the lexical boost was unrelated to the degree of STM deficit, suggesting that the lexical boost does not rely on explicit memory. Alternative explanations for the differing patterns for syntactic priming with and without lexical overlap are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Expert readers have been repeatedly reported to misperceive the centre of visual stimuli, shifting systematically to the left the bisection of any lines (pseudoneglect) while showing a cross‐over effect while bisecting different types of orthographic strings (Arduino et al., 2010, Neuropsychologia, 48, 2140). This difference has been attributed to asymmetrical allocation of attention that visuo‐verbal material receives when lexical access occurs (e.g., Fischer, 2004, Cognitive Brain Research, 4, 163). The aim of this study was to further examine which visual features guide recognition of potentially orthographic materials. To disentangle the role of orthography, heterogeneity, and visuo‐perceptual discreteness, we presented Italian unimpaired adults with four experiments exploiting the bisection paradigm. The results showed that a cross‐over effect emerges in most discrete strings, especially when their internal structure, that is being composed of heterogeneous elements, is suggestive of orthographically relevant material. Interestingly, the cross‐over effect systematically characterized the processing of letter strings (Experiment 2) and words (Experiments 3 and 4), whether visually discrete or not. Overall, this pattern of results suggests that neither discreteness nor heterogeneity per se are responsible for activating visual scanning mechanisms implied in text exploration, although both contribute to increasing the chance of a visual stimulus undergoing a perceptual analysis dedicated to pre‐lexical processing.

Abstract = {The present study aims at analyzing the role of nativeness, the amount of input in L1 acquisition and the multilingual competence in the performance of Italian–German bilingual speakers. We compare novel data from the performance of adult L2 learners (L1: Italian; late L2: German) and that of heritage speakers (heritage language: Italian; majority language: German) to previous data from monolingual speakers of Italian. The comparison deals with the produced word order at the syntax-discourse interface in sentences containing New Information Subjects in answers to questions that prompt the identification of the clausal subject. Overall, adult L2 speakers and heritage speakers perform alike but crucially differently from Italian monolinguals. These data reveal that multilingual proficiency determines an increased variety in the adopted answering strategies; in particular, the German-like strategy is active in Italian. Nativeness alone is thus no guarantee for a homogeneous performance across groups, nor do we find similar patterns of performance in speakers who grew up as monolinguals. Data also show heritage speakers’ sensitivity to verb classes, with answering strategies varying in accordance with the verb argument structure. Participants’ productions reveal an interesting relation in sentences with transitive verbs between subject position (pre-/postverbal) and object form (lexical DP/clitic pronoun).

Abstract = {In past decades, researchers have conducted a myriad of masked priming lexical decision experiments aimed at unveiling the early processes underlying lexical access. A relatively overlooked question is whether a masked unrelated wordlike/unwordlike prime influences the processing of the target stimuli. If participants apply to the primes the same instructions as to the targets, one would predict a response congruency effect (e.g., book-TRUE faster than fiok-TRUE). Critically, the Bayesian Reader model predicts that there should be no effects of response congruency in masked priming lexical decision, whereas interactive-activation models offer more flexible predictions. We conducted 3 masked priming lexical decision experiments with 4 unrelated priming conditions differing in lexical status and wordlikeness (high-frequency word, low-frequency word, orthographically legal pseudoword, consonant string). Experiment 1 used wordlike nonwords as foils, Experiment 2 used illegal nonwords as foils, and Experiment 3 used orthographically legal hermit nonwords as foils. When the foils were orthographically legal (Experiments 1 and 3; i.e., a standard lexical decision scenario), lexical decision responses were not affected by the lexical status or wordlikeness of the unrelated primes, as predicted by the Bayesian Reader model and the selective inhibition hypothesis in interactive-activation models. When the foils were illegal (Experiment 2), consonant-string primes produced the slowest responses for word targets and the fastest responses for nonword targets. The Bayesian Reader model can capture this pattern, assuming that participants in Experiment 2 were making an orthographic legality decision (i.e., anything legal must be a word) rather than a lexical decision.

Abstract = {Many studies show that it is challenging to encode morphosyntactic information while writing. Spelling plurals is especially demanding in French as these are inaudible. Even by the end of primary school, monolingual French pupils still have difficulties marking plurals of some grammatical categories. We investigate (1) how multilingual pupils learning French as a second written language deal with silent plural markers and (2) the effects of a morphosyntactic training explicitly focussing on grammatical categories and their markers, as well as visualizing the plural agreement. 228 fifth graders were quasi-randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 137) and a control group (n = 91) based on the results of a spelling pre-test. The results of the pre-test show that multilingual learners have similar spelling patterns as French monolinguals. They pluralize nouns more accurately than verbs and perform lowest on adjectives. After the pre-test, both groups were trained over six sessions of 20 minutes. The control group participated in French listening comprehension activities. The post-test shows that the intervention group significantly improved in spelling plurals compared to the control group. A greater focus on morphosyntactic structures is highly effective especially in second language contexts where children might lack broad lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {The current study examines the relationship between 18‐month‐old toddlers’ vocabulary size and their ability to inhibit attention to no‐longer relevant information using the backward semantic inhibition paradigm. When adults switch attention from one semantic category to another, the former and no‐longer‐relevant semantic category becomes inhibited, and subsequent attention to an item that belongs to the inhibited semantic category is impaired. Here we demonstrate that 18‐month‐olds can inhibit attention to no‐longer relevant semantic categories, but only if they have a relatively large vocabulary. These findings suggest that an increased number of items (word knowledge) in the toddler lexical‐semantic system during the 'vocabulary spurt' at 18‐months may be an important driving force behind the emergence of a semantic inhibitory mechanism. Possessing more words in the mental lexicon likely results in the formation of inhibitory links between words, which allow toddlers to select and deselect words and concepts more efficiently. Our findings highlight the role of vocabulary growth in the development of inhibitory processes in the emerging lexical‐semantic system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Contextual L2 word learning may be facilitated by increasing readers’ engagement with form and meaning of novel words. In the present study, two adult L2 populations, Chinese and Dutch speakers, read English sentences that contained novel vocabulary. These contextual exposures were accompanied either by form-focused elaboration (i.e. word-writing) or by meaning-focused elaboration (i.e. actively deriving word meaning from context). Immediate and delayed offline and online measures of word knowledge showed superior learning outcomes for the word-writing treatment. This finding is aligned with the predictions of the lexical quality hypothesis (Perfetti and Hart 2002), highlighting the added value of more precise encoding of a word’s form, in addition to learning its meaning. The key pedagogical implication of this study is that a simple act of copying novel words, while processing meaningful L2 input, may significantly boost quality of lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the existence of differences in lexical development as a function of day care attendance and maternal education. Data were collected using the MacArthur–Bates Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Sentences. The reports of 2084 toddlers were analysed. The results for toddlers older than 24 months indicated that those from mothers with higher educational levels produced a higher number of words in all lexical categories than those from mothers with lower educational levels. When considering younger toddlers, a significant effect of maternal education was only found on the number of common nouns produced. Nevertheless, the size of these effects was small. Quantity of day care attendance had no effect on the number of words produced. No interaction effects between maternal education and day care attendance were found. These findings indicate that maternal education may be differently associated with the production of words from different lexical categories.

Abstract = {Humans use time-varying pitch patterns to convey information in music and speech. Recognition of musical melodies and lexical tones relies on relative pitch (RP), the ability to identify intervals between two pitches. RP processing in music is usually more fine-grained than that in tonal languages. In Western music, there are twelve pitch categories within an octave, whereas there are only three level (non-glide) lexical tones in Taiwanese (or Taiwanese Hokkien, a tonal language). The present study aimed at comparing the neural substrates underlying RP processing of musical melodic intervals with that of level lexical tones in Taiwanese. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data from fourteen participants with good RP were analyzed. The results showed that imagining the sounds of visually presented musical intervals was associated with enhanced activity in the central subregion of the right dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), right posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and right dorsal precuneus compared to auditory imagery of visually presented Taiwanese bi-character words with level lexical tones. During the sound-congruence-judgement task (auditory imagery of musical intervals or bi-character words, and subsequently judging if the imagined sounds were melodically congruent with heard sounds), the contrast of the musical minus linguistic conditions yielded activity in the bilateral dPMC-PPC network and dorsal precuneus, with the dPMC activated in the rostral subregion. The central dPMC and PPC may mediate the attention-based maintenance of pitch intervals, whereas the dorsal precuneus may support attention control and the spatial/sensorimotor processing of the fine-grained pitch structures of music. When judging the congruence between the imagined and heard musical intervals, the bilateral rostral dPMC may play a role in attention control, working memory, evaluation of motor activities, and monitoring mechanisms. Based on the findings of this study and recent studies of amusia, we suggest that higher order cognitive operations are critical to the more fine-grained pitch processing of musical melodies compared to lexical tones.

Abstract = {We investigated how native language experience shapes anticipatory language processing. Two groups of bilinguals (either Spanish or Basque natives) performed a word matching task (WordMT) and a picture matching task (PictureMT). They indicated whether the stimuli they visually perceived matched with the noun they heard. Spanish noun endings were either diagnostic of the gender (transparent) or ambiguous (opaque). ERPs were time‐locked to an intervening gender‐marked determiner preceding the predicted noun. The determiner always gender agreed with the following noun but could also introduce a mismatching noun, so that it was not fully task diagnostic. Evoked brain activity time‐locked to the determiner was considered as reflecting updating/reanalysis of the task‐relevant preactivated representation. We focused on the timing of this effect by estimating the comparison between a gender‐congruent and a gender‐incongruent determiner. In the WordMT, both groups showed a late N400 effect. Crucially, only Basque natives displayed an earlier P200 effect for determiners preceding transparent nouns. In the PictureMT, both groups showed an early P200 effect for determiners preceding opaque nouns. The determiners of transparent nouns triggered a negative effect at ∼430 ms in Spanish natives, but at ∼550 ms in Basque natives. This pattern of results supports a 'retracing hypothesis' according to which the neurocognitive system navigates through the intermediate (sublexical and lexical) linguistic representations available from previous processing to evaluate the need of an update in the linguistic expectation concerning a target lexical item.

Abstract = {The CELEX lexical database (Baayen, Piepenbrock & van Rijn 1995) was developed in the 1990s, providing a database of the syntactic, morphological, phonological and orthographic forms of between 50,000 and 125,000 words of Dutch, English and German. This database was used as the basis for the development of the PolyLex lexicons, which included syntactic, morphological and phonological information for around 3,000 words of Dutch, English and German. Orthographic information was subsequently added in the PolyOrth project. The PolyOrth project was based on the assumption that the underlying, lexical phonological forms could be used to derive the surface orthographic forms by means of a combination of phoneme-grapheme mappings and sets of autonomous spelling rules for each language. One of the complications encountered during the project was the fact that the phonological forms in CELEX were not always genuinely underlying forms which made deriving the orthographic forms tricky. This paper discusses the nature and status of underlying phonological forms, their relation to orthography and the issues of finding this information in databases.

Abstract = {Listening to speech entails adapting to vast amounts of variability in the signal. The present study examined the relationship between flexibility for adaptation in a second language (L2) and robustness of L2 phonolexical representations. Phonolexical encoding and phonetic flexibility for German learners of English were assessed by means of a lexical decision task containing nonwords with sound substitutions and a distributional learning task, respectively. Performance was analyzed for an easy (/i/-/ɪ/) and a difficult contrast (/ɛ/-/æ/, where /æ/ does not exist in German). Results showed that for /i/-/ɪ/ listeners were quite accurate in lexical decision, and distributional learning consistently triggered shifts in categorization. For /ɛ/-/æ/, lexical decision performance was poor but individual participants’ scores related to performance in distributional learning: the better learners were in their lexical decision, the smaller their categorization shift. This suggests that, for difficult L2 contrasts, rigidity at the phonetic level relates to better lexical performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study examines the relation between lexical and phonological variables in 40 French-speaking children, aged 2;5. Specifically, it examines the influence of phonetic complexity, phonological production, phonological memory and neighbourhood density (ND) on vocabulary size. Children were divided into four groups on the basis of their scores on the French version of the Communicative Developmental Inventory (CDI): late1 (< 10%ile), late2 (15–25%ile), middle (40–60%ile) and precocious (> 90%ile). The children’s lexicons were coded in terms of phonetic complexity and ND (one-and two-syllable words), and their production capacities were determined from measuring percent consonants correct (PCC) and the number of syllable-initial (CSI) and -final (CSF) consonants in their phonetic inventories. The children also took part in a non-word repetition (NWR) task. Results indicated significant group differences in all four sets of variables. Children with larger vocabularies selected words with greater phonetic complexity and with lower ND values. They had superior PCC, CSI and NWR scores compared to children with smaller vocabularies. Linear regression analyses indicated that 76% of variance in vocabulary size could be accounted for by ND in combination with phonetic complexity and CSI. Our findings are consistent with previous studies which show that ND plays an important role in accounting for variance in vocabulary size. They also indicate that phonetic complexity and phonological production influence lexical acquisition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study is to analyze the changes in temporal synchrony between gesture and speech of multimodal communicative behaviors in the transition from babbling to two-word productions. Method: Ten Spanish-speaking children were observed at 9, 12, 15, and 18 months of age in a semistructured play situation. We longitudinally analyzed the synchrony between gestures and vocal productions and between their prominent parts. We also explored the relationship between gestural– vocal synchrony and independent measures of language development. Results: Results showed that multimodal communicative behaviors tend to be shorter with age, with an increasing overlap of its constituting elements. The same pattern is found when considering the synchrony between the prominent parts. The proportion of overlap between gestural and vocal elements at 15 months of age as well as the proportion of the stroke overlapped with vocalization appear to be related to lexical development 3 months later. Conclusions: These results suggest that children produce gestures and vocalizations as coordinated elements of a single communication system before the transition to the two-word stage. This coordination is related to subsequent lexical development in this period. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Speech is an inherently noisy and ambiguous signal. To fluently derive meaning, a listener must integrate contextual information to guide interpretations of the sensory input. Although many studies have demonstrated the influence of prior context on speech perception, the neural mechanisms supporting the integration of subsequent context remain unknown. Using MEG to record from human auditory cortex, we analyzed responses to spoken words with a varyingly ambiguous onset phoneme, the identity of which is later disambiguated at the lexical uniqueness point. Fifty participants (both male and female) were recruited across two MEG experiments. Our findings suggest that primary auditory cortex is sensitive to phonological ambiguity very early during processing at just 50msafter onset. Subphonemic detail is preserved in auditory cortex over long timescales and re-evoked at subsequent phoneme positions. Commitments to phonological categories occur in parallel, resolving on the shorter timescale of ∼450 ms. These findings provide evidence that future input determines the perception of earlier speech sounds by maintaining sensory features until they can be integrated with top-down lexical information.

Abstract = {Young adults show consistent neural benefits of predictable contexts when processing upcoming words, but these benefits are less clear-cut in older adults. Here we disentangle the neural correlates of prediction accuracy and contextual support during word processing, in order to test current theories that suggest that neural mechanisms underlying predictive processing are specifically impaired in older adults. During a sentence comprehension task, older and younger readers were asked to predict passage-final words and report the accuracy of these predictions. Age-related reductions were observed for N250 and N400 effects of prediction accuracy, as well as for N400 effects of contextual support independent of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, temporal primacy of predictive processing (i.e., earlier facilitation for successful predictions) was preserved across the lifespan, suggesting that predictive mechanisms are unlikely to be uniquely impaired in older adults. In addition, older adults showed prediction effects on frontal post-N400 positivities (PNPs) that were similar in amplitude to PNPs in young adults. Previous research has shown correlations between verbal fluency and lexical prediction in older adult readers, suggesting that the production system may be linked to capacity for lexical prediction, especially in aging. The current study suggests that verbal fluency modulates PNP effects of contextual support, but not prediction accuracy. Taken together, our findings suggest that aging does not result in specific declines in lexical prediction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

The effects of stimulus variability on lexical tone and musical interval tasks among non-tone language speakers were compared using a matching (XAB) task under varying levels of stimulus variability. Listeners perceived Mandarin words better with single rather than multiple speakers and showed similar advantages in melodic interval perception for low (single instrument) versus high (multiple instruments) variability sets. Lexical tone and musical interval perception were affected similarly by increasing stimulus variability, on average. However, the magnitude of variability effects within subjects was not well correlated between the tasks, providing no evidence for shared category-mapping mechanism for the two domains. Instead, it suggests that crossover between tone and melody processing is driven by shared encoding of acoustic-phonetic features, and that differences in performance and learning by tone language speakers and musicians in the other domain represent progress along a phonetic–phonological–lexical continuum.

Abstract = {Many experiments have studied attraction errors in number agreement (e.g. ‘The key to the cabinets were rusty’). It has been noted that singular heads with plural dependents (attractors) trigger larger attraction effects than plural heads with singular attractors, and that in languages with morphological case, morphologically ambiguous attractors trigger larger effects (accusative plural forms coinciding with nominative plural were compared to unambiguous case forms). In Russian, the nominative plural forms of some nouns coincide not only with their accusative plural forms but also with the genitive singular. In one production and two comprehension experiments, such genitive singular forms were found to trigger larger attraction effects than morphologically unambiguous genitive plural forms. Accusative plural forms coinciding with the nominative plural were shown to be the most effective attractors. These results have implications for different models of attraction and for other discussions in morphology concerning ambiguity processing, different approaches to syncretism and the problem of lexical insertion.

Abstract = {With 40,000 words in the average vocabulary, how can speakers find the specific words that they want so quickly and easily? Cumulative semantic interference in language production provides a clue: when naming a large series of pictures, with a few mammals sprinkled about, naming each subsequent mammal becomes slower and more error-prone. Such interference mirrors predictions from an incremental learning algorithm applied to meaning-driven retrieval from an established vocabulary, suggesting retrieval benefits from a constant, implicit, re-optimization process (Oppenheim et al., 2010). But how quickly would a new mammal (e.g. paca) engage in this re-optimization? In this experiment, 18 participants studied 3 novel and 3 familiar exemplars from each of six semantic categories, and immediately performed a timed picture-naming task. Consistent with the learning model’s predictions, naming latencies revealed immediate cumulative semantic interference in all directions: from new words to new words, from new words to old words, from old words to new words, and from old words to old words. Repeating the procedure several days later produced similar-magnitude effects, demonstrating that newly acquired words can be immediately semantically integrated, at least to the extent necessary to produce typical cumulative semantic interference. These findings extend the Dark Side model’s scope to include novel word production, and are considered in terms of mechanisms for lexical selection.

Abstract = {The current fMRI study was designed to investigate whether the processing of different gender-related cues embedded in nouns affects the computation of agreement dependencies and, if so, where this possible interaction is mapped in the brain. We used the Spanish gender agreement system, which makes it possible to manipulate two different factors: the agreement between different sentence constituents (i.e., by contrasting congruent versus incongruent determiner-noun pairs) and the formal (i.e., orthographical/morphological) and/or lexical information embedded in the noun –i.e., by contrasting transparent (e.g., libromasc. [book]; lunafem. [moon]) and opaque nouns (e.g., lápizmasc. [pencil]; vejezfem. [old age]). Crucially, these data illustrated, for the first time, how the network underlying agreement is sensitive to different gender-to-ending cues: different sources of gender information associated with nouns affect the neural circuits involved in the computation of local agreement dependencies. When the gender marking is informative (as in the case of transparent nouns), both formal and lexical information is used to establish grammatical relations. In contrast, when no formal cues are available (as in the case of opaque nouns), gender information is retrieved from the lexicon. We demonstrated the involvement of the posterior MTG/STG, pars triangularis within the IFG, and parietal regions during gender agreement computation. Critically, in order to integrate the different available information sources, the dynamics of this fronto-temporal loop change and additional regions, such as the hippocampus, the angular and the supramarginal gyri are recruited. These results underpin previous neuroanatomical models proposed in the context of both gender processing and sentence comprehension. But, more importantly, they provide valuable information regarding how and where the brain's language system dynamically integrates all the available form-based and lexical cues during comprehension.

Abstract = {Current models of word-meaning access typically assume that lexical-semantic representations of ambiguous words (e.g., ‘bark of the dog/tree’) reach a relatively stable state in adulthood, with only the relative frequencies of meanings and immediate sentence context determining meaning preference. However, recent experience also affects interpretation: recently encountered word-meanings become more readily available (Rodd et al., 2016, 2013). Here, 3 experiments investigated how multiple encounters with word-meanings influence the subsequent interpretation of these ambiguous words. Participants heard ambiguous words contextually-disambiguated towards a particular meaning and, after a 20- to 30-min delay, interpretations of the words were tested in isolation. We replicate the finding that 1 encounter with an ambiguous word biased the later interpretation of this word towards the primed meaning for both subordinate (Experiments 1, 2, 3) and dominant meanings (Experiment 1). In addition, for the first time, we show cumulative effects of multiple repetitions of both the same and different meanings. The effect of a single subordinate exposure persisted after a subsequent encounter with the dominant meaning, compared to a dominant exposure alone (Experiment 1). Furthermore, 3 subordinate word-meaning repetitions provided an additional boost to priming compared to 1, although only when their presentation was spaced (Experiments 2, 3); massed repetitions provided no such boost (Experiments 1, 3). These findings indicate that comprehension is guided by the collective effect of multiple recently activated meanings and that the spacing of these activations is key to producing lasting updates to the lexical-semantic network.

Abstract = {Even single words in isolation can evoke emotional reactions, but the mechanisms by which emotion is involved in automatic lexical processing are unclear. Previous studies using extremely similar materials and methods have yielded apparently incompatible patterns of results. In much previous work, however, words' emotional content is entangled with other non-emotional characteristics such as frequency of occurrence, familiarity and age of acquisition, all of which have potential consequences for lexical processing themselves. In the present study, the authors compare different models of emotion using the British Lexicon Project, a large-scale freely available lexical decision database. After controlling for the potentially confounding effects of non-emotional variables, a variety of statistical approaches revealed that emotional words, whether positive or negative, are processed faster than neutral words.

Contrary to expectations, 94.4% of the WordNet 1.5 synsets still persisted in the latest 2012 version, compared to only 89.1% of the corresponding sense keys.

Furthermore, for the first time, data for both adults and children are available.

Abstract = {Cognitive mechanisms for sign language lexical access are fairly unknown. This study investigated whether phonological similarity facilitates lexical retrieval in sign languages using measures from a new lexical database for American Sign Language. Additionally, it aimed to determine which similarity metric best fits the present data in order to inform theories of how phonological similarity is constructed within the lexicon and to aid in the operationalization of phonological similarity in sign language. Sign repetition latencies and accuracy were obtained when native signers were asked to reproduce a sign displayed on a computer screen. Results indicated that, as predicted, phonological similarity facilitated repetition latencies and accuracy as long as there were no strict constraints on the type of sublexical features that overlapped. The data converged to suggest that one similarity measure, MaxD, defined as the overlap of any 4 sublexical features, likely best represents mechanisms of phonological similarity in the mental lexicon. Together, these data suggest that lexical access in sign language is facilitated by phonologically similar lexical representations in memory and the optimal operationalization is defined as liberal constraints on overlap of 4 out of 5 sublexical features--similar to the majority of extant definitions in the literature.},

Age of acquisition is compared to a measure of lexical development based on vocabulary size rather than age, and robust regression models are used to assess the individual and joint effects of word class, frequency, imageability and phonological neighbourhood density on Norwegian children's early lexical development. The Norwegian Communicative Development Inventories (CDI) norms were used to calculate each CDI word's age of acquisition and vocabulary size of acquisition. Lexical properties were downloaded from the lexical database Norwegian Words, supplemented with data on frequency in adult and child-directed speech. Age of acquisition correlated highly with vocabulary size of acquisition, but the new measure was more evenly distributed and more sensitive to lexical effects. Frequency in child-directed speech was the most important predictor of lexical development, followed by imageability, which seems to account for the dominance of nominals over predicates in Norwegian.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of the mental lexicon, the way meaning is extracted from word forms, is almost entirely built on data from spoken languages. While there is much work demonstrating that in many ways the linguistic structure and psychological mechanisms for processing signed language and spoken language processing are the same, less is known about the signed language mental lexicon. In this dissertation, I examine the structure of the American Sign Language mental lexicon, and the ways meaning can be extracted from the manual/visual signal. In the third chapter of this dissertation I ask whether a single cognitive architecture might explain diverse behavioral patterns in signed and spoken language. Chen and Mirman (2012) presented a computational model of word processing that unified opposite effects of neighborhood density in speech production, perception, and written word recognition. Carreiras et al. (2008) demonstrate that neighborhood density effects in Spanish Sign Language (LSE) also vary depending on whether the neighbors share the same handshape or location. We present a spreading activation architecture that borrows the principles proposed by Chen and Mirman (2012), and show that if this architecture is elaborated to incorporate relatively minor facts about either 1) the time course of sign perception or 2) the frequency of sub-lexical units in sign languages, it produces data that match the experimental findings from sign languages. This work serves as a proof of concept that a single cognitive architecture could underlie both sign and word recognition. In the second chapter I present ASL-LEX, a lexical database for ASL that catalogues more than forty properties about almost 1,000 signs. The database includes, for example, information about each sign's iconicity, phonological make-up, and neighborhood density. I use this information to better understand the structure of the ASL lexicon, the distribution of each of these properties, and the relationships between these properties. This lexical database is the largest and most comprehensive database of ASL, and can be used by researchers to develop experiments and by educators to identify and support vocabulary development. In the fourth chapter, I use ASL-LEX to develop a tightly-controlled study of sign perception. I ask whether neighborhood density and sub-lexical frequency play a role in sign perception, and if the mechanisms of sign perception are affected by early language experience. Eighty deaf participants with varying early language backgrounds completed a lexical decision task. I find that neighborhood density inhibits sign perception in people with low early ASL exposure, but has no effect in people with high early ASL exposure. Location frequency inhibits sign perception in all people, but the effect is stronger in people with low early ASL exposure. This suggests that impoverished access to ASL early in life has lasting consequences for sign perception. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of how semantic information can be automatically assigned to compound terms, i.e. both a definition and a set of semantic relations. This is particularly crucial when elaborating multilingual databases and when developing cross-language information retrieval systems. The paper shows how morphosemantics can contribute in the constitution of multilingual lexical networks in biomedical corpora. It presents a system capable of labelling terms with morphologically related words, i.e. providing them with a definition, and grouping them according to synonymy, hyponymy and proximity relations. The approach requires the interaction of three techniques: (1) a language-specific morphosemantic parser, (2) a multilingual table defining basic relations between word roots and (3) a set of language-independent rules to draw up the list of related terms. This approach has been fully implemented for French, on an about 29,000 terms biomedical lexicon, resulting )},

Abstract = {Insight problem solving has been conceptualized as a dynamic search through a constrained search space, where a non-obvious solution needs to be found. Multiple sources of task difficulty have been defined that can keep the problem solver from finding the right solution such as an overly large search space or knowledge constraints requiring a change of the problem representation. Up to now, there are very few accounts that focus on different aspects of difficulty within an insight problem-solving context and how they affect task performance as well as the probability of finding a solution that is accompanied by an Aha! experience. In addition, we are not aware of any approaches investigating how knowledge constraints parametrically modulate task performance and the Aha! experience in compound remote associates (CRA) when controlling for other sources of task difficulty. Therefore, we first developed, tested, and externally validated a modified CRA paradigm in combination with lexical priming that is more likely to elicit representational change than the classical CRA tasks. Second, we parametrically estimated the effect of the knowledge constraint together with other sources of difficulty (size of the problem and search space, word length and frequency) using general linear mixed models. The knowledge constraint (and the size of the search space) was operationalized as lexical distance (measured as cosine distances) between different word pairs within this task. Our results indicate that the experimentally induced knowledge constraint still affects task performance and is negatively related to the Aha! experience when controlling for various other types of task difficulties. Finally, we will present the complete stimulus set in German language together with their statistical (i.e., item difficulty and mean solution time) and lexical properties.

Abstract = {Previous work on English and Korean demonstrates that words are more quickly identified as real words when they are produced by a voice congruent with the age of the talkers who are most likely to use the word (Kim, 2016, Laboratory Phonology, 7, 18; Walker & Hay, 2011, Laboratory Phonology, 2, 219–237). However, this previous work presents stimuli blocked by voice, giving the participant ample time to form expectations about the talker and the words that the talker would likely use. To test whether the effect can be observed in the absence of cues to talker age prior to word onset, the current experiment replicates Kim (2016, Laboratory Phonology, 7, 18) but without blocking by talker. Results from the current experiment confirm earlier findings and they demonstrate that the effect can be observed even without the listener having any expectations about the talker prior to hearing the word. We discuss the implications of these results for models of speech perception, suggesting that lexical access is rapidly boosted by socio‐indexical phonetic cues that are congruent with socio‐indexical lexical information.

Abstract = {Morphological complexity is a highly debated issue in visual word recognition. Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that speakers are sensitive to degrees of morphological complexity. Two‐step derived complex words (bridging through bridgeN > bridgeV > bridging) led to more enhanced activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus than their 1‐step derived counterparts (running through runV > running). However, it remains unclear whether sensitivity to degrees of morphological complexity extends to pseudowords. If this were the case, it would indicate that abstract knowledge of morphological structure is independent of lexicality. We addressed this question by investigating the processing of two sets of pseudowords in German. Both sets contained morphologically viable two‐step derived pseudowords differing in the number of derivational steps required to access an existing lexical representation and therefore the degree of structural analysis expected during processing. Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, we found lexicality effects to be distinct from processing signatures relating to structural analysis in pseudowords. Semantically‐driven processes such as lexical search showed a more frontal distribution while combinatorial processes related to structural analysis engaged more parietal parts of the network. Specifically, more complex pseudowords showed increased activation in parietal regions (right superior parietal lobe and left precuneus) relative to pseudowords that required less structural analysis to arrive at an existing lexical representation. As the two sets were matched on cohort size and surface form, these results highlight the role of internal levels of morphological structure even in forms that do not possess a lexical representation.

Abstract = {To investigate phonological effects in visual word recognition, a visual lexical decision task was used in which the critical stimuli were two types of highly familiar Hebrew acronyms: ‘phonological’ acronyms that are conventionally pronounced as single words via letter‐to‐sound translation (ד'ש (d'ʃ) = /daʃ/), and ‘lexical’ acronyms that are conventionally pronounced according to their full multiword name (ת'א(t'ʔ) = /tel/ /aviv/). Thus, in the case of ‘phonological’ acronyms, phonological recoding may contribute to the recognition process, while in the case of ‘lexical’ acronyms, it may interfere ((ת'אt'ʔ) ≠ taʔ/). If familiar letter strings are accessed mainly orthographically, as assumed by dual route models, then no difference is expected between these two types of acronyms. Alternatively, if phonological recoding influences word recognition, then ‘phonological’ acronyms should be easier to recognise. Consistent with this latter interactive‐connectionist view, responses were faster and more accurate in the ‘phonological’ than in the ‘lexical’ condition.

Abstract = {We tested the theoretically driven hypotheses that children’s orthographic and semantic learning are associated with their word reading and reading comprehension skills, even when orthographic and semantic knowledge are taken into account. A sample of 139 English-speaking Grade 3 children completed a learning task in which they read stories about new inventions. Then they were tested on their learning of the spelling and meaning of the inventions (i.e., orthographic and semantic learning, respectively). Word reading and reading comprehension were assessed with standardised tasks, and orthographic and semantic knowledge were assessed with choice tasks targeting the spelling and meaning of existing words. The results of our structural equation modeling indicated that orthographic learning predicted word reading directly and reading comprehension indirectly via word reading. We also found that semantic learning predicted reading comprehension directly. These findings support integration of the self-teaching hypothesis and the lexical quality hypothesis.

Abstract = {Research on nonnative auditory word recognition makes use of a lexical decision task with phonological priming to explore the role of phonological form in nonnative lexical access. In a medium-lag lexical decision task with phonological priming, nonnative speakers treat minimal pairs of words differentiated by a difficult phonological contrast as a repetition of the same word. While native speakers show facilitation in medium-lag priming only for identical word pairs, nonnative speakers also show facilitation for minimal pairs. In short-lag phonological priming, when the prime and the target have phonologically overlapping onsets, nonnative speakers show facilitation, while native speakers show inhibition. This review discusses two possible reasons for facilitation in nonnative phonological priming: reduced sensitivity to nonnative phonological contrasts, and reduced lexical competition of nonnative words with under differentiated, or fuzzy phonolexical representations. Nonnative words may be processed sublexically, which leads to sublexical facilitation instead of the inhibition resulting from lexical competition.

Abstract = {Frontal and temporal white matter pathways play key roles in language processing, but the specific computations supported by different tracts remain a matter of study. A role in speech planning has been proposed for a recently described pathway, the frontal aslant tract (FAT), which connects the posterior inferior frontal gyrus to the pre-SMA. Here, we use longitudinal functional and structural MRI and behavioral testing to evaluate the behavioral consequences of a lesion to the left FAT that was incurred during surgical resection of a frontal glioma in a 60-year-old woman, Patient AF. The pattern of performance in AF is compared, using the same measures, with that in a 37-year-old individual who underwent a left anterior temporal resection and hippocampectomy (Patient AG). AF and AG were both cognitively intact preoperatively but exhibited specific and doubly dissociable behavioral deficits postoperatively: AF had dysfluent speech but no word finding difficulty, whereas AG had word finding difficulty but otherwise fluent speech. Probabilistic tractography showed that the left FAT was lesioned postoperatively in AF (but not AG) whereas the inferior longitudinal fasciculus was lesioned in AG (but not AF). Those structural changes were supported by corresponding changes in functional connectivity to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus: decreased functional connectivity postoperatively between the posterior inferior frontal gyrus and pre-SMA in AF (but not AG) and decreased functional connectivity between the posterior inferior frontal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus in AG (but not AF). We suggest from these findings that the left FAT serves as a key communicative link between sentence planning and lexical access processes.

Abstract = {Although the relationship between sound and meaning in language is assumed to be largely arbitrary, reliable correspondences between sound and meaning in natural language appear to facilitate word learning. Using a set of independently normed pseudoword and shape stimuli, we examined the real-time effects of sound-to-shape correspondences at initial presentation and throughout an extended learning process resulting in high accuracy. In addition to accuracy and response time (RT) measures, we monitored participants’ eye movements to investigate the extent to which visual orienting to objects is influenced by the sound symbolic characteristics of novel labels at initial exposure and throughout learning. Over the course of word learning, congruency of sound and shape properties affected both accuracy and RT with higher accuracy and faster responses for congruent than incongruent items. Eye tracking data reveal that congruent targets were fixated faster than incongruent targets throughout learning and that nontargets consistent with the sound symbolic properties of the word remained attractive distracters, even after overt behavioral differences in accuracy disappeared. This demonstrates the sustained influence of sound symbolism and the importance of sensitive, continuous measures of assessing sound symbolic effects in word learning and lexical processing. Arbitrariness resulted in better final individuation performance only when the arbitrary items were more phonologically distinct than the sound symbolic stimuli. These findings suggest that the advantages of sound symbolism may persist beyond early word learning and serve to significantly influence online lexical processing.

Abstract = {Neurocognitive models of written-word processing from low-level perceptual up to semantic analysis include the notion of a strongly left-lateralized posterior-to-anterior stream of activation. Two left-lateralized components in the event-related brain potential (ERP), N170 and temporo-parietal PSA (posterior semantic asymmetry; peak at 300 ms), have been suggested to reflect sublexical analysis and semantic processing, respectively. However, for intermediate processing steps, such as lexical access, no posterior left-lateralized ERP signature has yet been observed under single-word reading conditions. In combination with a recognition task, lexicality and depth of processing were varied. Left-minus-right difference ERPs optimally suited to accentuate left-lateralized language processes revealed an occipito-temporal processing negativity (210–270 ms) for all stimuli except alphanumerical strings. This asymmetry showed greater sensitivity to the combined effects of attention and lexicality than other ERPs in this time range (i.e., N170, P1, and P2). It is therefore introduced as 'lexical asymmetry.' (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A central issue in spoken word production concerns how activation is transmitted from semantic to phonological levels. Recent evidence from studies of speakers of Western languages supports a cascaded view, according to which under certain circumstances, lexical candidates other than the target can activate their corresponding phonological properties. In the current study, we investigated possible differences between English and Mandarin speakers concerning the degree of cascadedness in the production system, based on the broader recent claim that properties of word form encoding might differ according to languages. With English speakers (Experiment 1), we found that when activation of targets and semantic competitors was boosted via a manipulation of semantic context, then concurrently presented 'mediated' distractor words (which were phonologically related to a semantic competitor) generated interference. However, no such mediated priming was found in a parallel experiment with Chinese materials and Mandarin speakers (Experiment 2). These results suggest potential fundamental differences across the target languages in how activation is transmitted during lexical access.

Abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that Chinese-learning children use lexical pitch pattern to disambiguate words throughout development but English-learning children do not. To determine which linguistic properties lead children to retain such sensitivity, we focused on Japanese, a pitch accent language in which pitch pattern accompanies every word but plays a far weaker role in word discrimination than in Chinese. We observed Japanese-learning 24-month-olds’ responses to a familiar word with an incorrect pitch pattern in a picture fixation task. The results show that children could identify the referent familiar object, although they needed more time to do so than when the word was presented with the correct pitch pattern. These results suggest that young Japanese children do not treat pitch pattern as a determinant of word meanings, although they can easily detect changes in pitch patterns. The findings are discussed in terms of the language properties that affect children’s sensitivity to lexical pitch information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

The former method, however, is time-consuming, and the latter method, owing to a lack of language resources, cannot be performed on PQAC. As a result, a method based on word definitions in a monolingual dictionary is proposed. Specifically, for each sense, kernel words are first extracted from its definition, and the senses of each kernel word are then determined by graph-based Word Sense Disambiguation. Finally, one optimal sense is )},

Abstract = {We present Chinese translation norms for 1,429 English words. Chinese-English bilinguals (N = 28) were asked to provide the first Chinese translation that came to mind for 1,429 English words. The results revealed that 71 % of the English words received more than one correct translation indicating the large amount of translation ambiguity when translating from English to Chinese. The relationship between translation ambiguity and word frequency, concreteness and language proficiency was investigated. Although the significant correlations were not strong, results revealed that English word frequency was positively correlated with the number of alternative translations, whereas English word concreteness was negatively correlated with the number of translations. Importantly, regression analyses showed that the number of Chinese translations was predicted by word frequency and concreteness. Furthermore, an interaction between these predictors revealed that the number of translations was m)},

Abstract = {Human language relies on a finite lexicon to express a potentially infinite set of ideas. A key result of this tension is that words acquire novel senses over time. However, the cognitive processes that underlie the historical emergence of new word senses are poorly understood. Here, we present a computational framework that formalizes competing views of how new senses of a word might emerge by attaching to existing senses of the word. We test the ability of the models to predict the temporal order in which the senses of individual words have emerged, using an historical lexicon of English spanning the past millennium. Our findings suggest that word senses emerge in predictable ways, following an historical path that reflects cognitive efficiency, predominantly through a process of nearest-neighbor chaining. Our work contributes a formal account of the generative processes that underlie lexical evolution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this study a picture–word interference paradigm was used to investigate how grammatical mass/count information is processed during noun phrase production in English. Theories of lexical processing distinguish between two different types of lexical–syntactic information: variable extrinsic lexical–syntactic features, such as number (singular, plural), and fixed intrinsic lexical–syntactic properties, such as grammatical gender (e.g., masculine, feminine). Previous research using the picture–word interference paradigm has found effects of distractor lexical–syntactic congruency for grammatical gender but no congruency effects for number. We used this phenomenon to investigate whether mass/count information is processed similarly to grammatical gender. In two experiments, participants named pictures of mass or count objects using determiner noun phrases (e.g., Experiment 1 with mass and plural count nouns: 'not muchmass ricemass', 'not manycount pegscount'; Experiment 2 with mass and singular count nouns: 'some ricemass', 'a pegcount'), while ignoring distractors that were countability congruent or incongruent nouns. The results revealed a countability congruency effect for mass and plural count nouns in Experiment 1 and for singular count nouns, but not mass nouns in Experiment 2. This is similar to grammatical gender suggesting that countability processing is predominantly driven by a noun’s lexical–syntactic information.

We hypothesize that compared to individual, social leisure activities explain better the ON performance in the older adults, which is explained by a mechanism of neural reserve. Our results in older adults indicate (a) a significant correlation between leisure social activities and the response time for ON, (b) a significant correlation between link the neural activity of the left superior and medial frontal (SmFG) for ON and leisure social activities.

Abstract = {Atypical neural responses to language have been found in toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and in their unaffected siblings. However, given that language difficulties are often seen in these children, it is difficult to interpret whether these neural differences are a result of the diagnosis of ASD or impairments in their language abilities. In this study, we recorded event‐related potentials (ERPs) from four groups of 36‐month‐olds: low‐risk control (LRC), high risk for ASD defined as having an older sibling with ASD (HRA) but who do not have ASD or milder autism‐like symptoms (HRA‐Typ), HRA children who do not have ASD but exhibit milder autism‐like symptoms (HRA‐Atyp) and HRA children diagnosed with ASD (ASD). Children listened to words expected to be acquired early (e.g. ball) and words expected to be acquired late (e.g. calf). ERPs were analysed over time windows sensitive to word processing as well as frontal and temporo‐parietal sites over the left and right hemispheres. When controlling for language abilities, there were group differences within the temporo‐parietal sites. Specifically, the HRA‐Atyp group showed a different timed response to late words compared to the ASD and LRC groups. In addition, we found a relation between neural responses in the left frontal sites and ASD severity. Our results suggest that both language abilities and ASD diagnoses are important to consider when interpreting neural differences in lexical processing.

Abstract = {What are the effects of word‐by‐word predictability on sentence processing times during the natural reading of a text? Although information complexity metrics such as surprisal and entropy reduction have been useful in addressing this question, these metrics tend to be estimated using computational language models, which require some degree of commitment to a particular theory of language processing. Taking a different approach, this study implemented a large‐scale cumulative cloze task to collect word‐by‐word predictability data for 40 passages and compute surprisal and entropy reduction values in a theory‐neutral manner. A separate group of participants read the same texts while their eye movements were recorded. Results showed that increases in surprisal and entropy reduction were both associated with increases in reading times. Furthermore, these effects did not depend on the global difficulty of the text. The findings suggest that surprisal and entropy reduction independently contribute to variation in reading times, as these metrics seem to capture different aspects of lexical predictability.

Abstract = {We report five experiments using the picture-word task to examine lexical selection by comparing the effects of translation distractors in bilinguals and synonym distractors in monolinguals. Three groups of bilinguals named objects in their L1 or L2, and English monolinguals named objects using common names (e.g., DOG ='dog') or, in a novel manipulation, using synonymous alternative names (e.g., DOG ='hound', GLASSES ='spectacles'). All studies produced strikingly similar results. When bilinguals named in L1, there was a small facilitation effect from translation distractors, but larger facilitation when they named in L2. When monolinguals produced common names, there was no reliable effect from synonym distractors, but facilitation when they produced alternative names. (There were also strong identity facilitation effects in all naming conditions.) We discuss the relevance of these results for the debate concerning the role of competition in lexical selection and propose that for speech production there are direct facilitatory connections between the lexical representations of translations in bilinguals (and between synonyms in monolinguals). The effects of synonyms in monolinguals appear to 'simulate' the effects found for translations in bilinguals, which suggest that there are commonalities in monolingual and bilingual lexical selection.

Abstract = {In everyday conversations, we take advantage of lexical-semantic contexts to facilitate speech production, but at the same time, we also have to reduce interference and inhibit semantic competitors. The blocked cyclic naming paradigm (BCNP) has been used to investigate such context effects. Typical results on production latencies showed semantic facilitation (or no effect) during the first presentation cycle, and interference emerging in subsequent cycles. Even if semantic contexts might be just as facilitative as interfering, previous BCNP studies focused on interference, which was interpreted as reflecting lemma selection and self-monitoring processes. Facilitation in the first cycle was rarely considered/analysed, although it potentially informs on word production to the same extent as interference. Here we contrasted the event-related potential (ERP) signatures of both semantic facilitation and interference in a BCNP. ERPs differed between homogeneous and heterogeneous blocks from about 365 msec post picture onset in the first cycle (facilitation) and in an earlier time-window (270 msec post picture onset) in the third cycle (interference). Three different analyses of the ERPs converge towards distinct processes underlying semantic facilitation and interference (post-lexical vs lexical respectively). The loci of semantic facilitation and interference are interpreted in the context of different theoretical frameworks of language production: the post-lexical locus of semantic facilitation involves interactive phonological-semantic processes and/or self-monitoring, whereas the lexical locus of semantic interference is in line with selection through increased lexical competition.

Abstract = {The predictive validity of various corpus-based frequency norms in first-language lexical processing has been intensively investigated in previous research, but less attention has been paid to this issue in second-language (L2) processing. To bridge the gap, in the present study we took English as a case in point and compared the predictive power of a large set of corpus-based frequency norms for the performance of an L2 English visual lexical decision task (LDT). Our results showed that, in general, the frequency norms from SUBTLEX-US and WorldLex–Blog tended to predict L2 performance better in reaction times, whereas the frequency norms from corpora with a mixture of written and spoken genres (CELEX, WorldLex–Blog, BNC, ANC, and COCA) tended to predict L2 accuracy better. Although replicated in both low- and high-proficiency L2 English learners, these patterns were not exactly the same as those found in LDT data from native English speakers. In addition, we only observed some limited advantages of the lemma frequency and contextual diversity measures over the wordform frequency measure in predicting L2 lexical processing. The results of the present study, especially the detailed comparisons among the different corpora, provide methodological implications for future L2 lexical research.

Abstract = {Four language production experiments examine how English speakers plan compound words during phonological encoding. The experiments tested production latencies in both delayed and online tasks for English noun-noun compounds (e.g., daytime), adjective-noun phrases (e.g., dark time), and monomorphemic words (e.g., denim). In delayed production, speech onset latencies reflect the total number of prosodic units in the target sentence. In online production, speech latencies reflect the size of the first prosodic unit. Compounds are metrically similar to adjective-noun phrases as they contain two lexical and two prosodic words. However, in Experiments 1 and 2, native English speakers treated the compounds as single prosodic units, indistinguishable from simple words, with RT data statistically different than that of the adjective-noun phrases. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrate that compounds are also treated as single prosodic units in utterances containing clitics (e.g., dishcloths are clean) as they incorporate the verb into a single phonological word (i.e. dishcloths-are). Taken together, these results suggest that English compounds are planned as single recursive prosodic units. Our data require an adaptation of the classic model of phonological encoding to incorporate a distinction between lexical and postlexical prosodic processes, such that lexical boundaries have consequences for post-lexical phonological encoding.

Abstract = {Language control, bilinguals’ ability to regulate which language is used, has been posited to recruit domain-general cognitive control. However, studies relating language control and cognitive control have yielded mixed results in adults and have not been undertaken in children. The current study examined the contributions of nonlinguistic task-shifting to language control in Spanish–English bilingual children (ages 5–7) during a cued-switch picture-naming task. Language control was assessed at two levels: (1) cross-language errors, which indexed the success of language selection, and (2) naming speed, which indexed the efficiency of lexical selection. Nonlinguistic task-shifting was a robust predictor of children's cross-language errors, reflecting a role for domain-general cognitive control during language selection. However, task-shifting predicted naming speed only in children's non-dominant language, suggesting a more nuanced role for cognitive control in the efficiency of selecting a particular lexical target.

The series of experiments reported in this chapter was aimed at refining our understanding of mechanisms in the way bilinguals process language production by examining two different paradigms—primed picture naming and picture-word interference.

Abstract = {Lexical acquisition requires the ability to identify word boundaries in a continuous auditory speech stream. This complex task is even more challenging when learning a new language in adulthood. Previous studies have shown that word boundary identification can be enhanced by pairing musical tones with native language phonemes. The objective of this dissertation study was to investigate whether musical tones also have this effect in a novel pseudo-language that uses non-native speech sounds. The N400, a brain event-related potential that has been linked with familiarity responses and detection of statistical regularities during exposure to pseudowords, provides an index of brain activation associated with semantico-lexical processing. In this study, language-like stimuli incorporating a French phoneme (a high, front, rounded vowel that is not part of the English phonetic inventory) were presented to typically developing English monolingual adults. Participants were presented to one of two types of exposure conditions for 7 minutes: monotone presentation of the concatenated language-like stimuli; or the same speech stream with a musical tone associated with each syllable. The exposure protocol was based on Schon, Boyer, Moreno et. al. (2008). Exposure was followed by a lexical decision task, requiring participants to distinguish 'words' (heard during the exposure in a concatenated speech stream) from 'part words' (end of one word and the beginning of another, crossing word boundaries). High-density EEG was recorded during the lexical decision and analyzed offline to determine N400 event-related responses to the stimuli in each condition. Although behavioral measures did not reveal any significant differences between groups or conditions, we found a N4 significantly different response to 'partword' in the tone-exposed group, compared to the monotone. This difference only occurred in a frontal region with a right-hemisphere bias, and was not found to be significant over the left hemisphere. This difference suggests that participants in the tone group were supported in differentiating 'words' from 'partwords', supporting the view that the inclusion of tonal information is beneficial in the early stages of L2 lexical learning.

Abstract = {The current research examined the processes involved in speech perception and the relation of speech perception to phonological short-term memory (pSTM). Contrary to traditional models which assume that sublexical processing necessarily precedes lexical processing (e.g., McClelland & Elman, 1986; Norris, 1994), several studies have demonstrated that patients may perform better on lexical than sublexical speech perception tasks (e.g., Miceli, Gainotti, Caltagirone, & Masullo, 1980). These findings have led to proposals of separate sublexical and lexical routes in speech perception (dual route models; e.g., Hickok & Poeppel, 2000). However, studies demonstrating these dissociations did not closely match the phonological similarity of targets and distractors or task demands between sublexical and lexical tasks. Experiment 1, which rectified these design problems, demonstrated a close correspondence between sublexical and lexical processing across several speech discrimination tasks for brain damaged patients and supported obligatory sublexical processing models of speech perception. Experiment 2 sought to provide converging evidence by tracking patients' eye movements while they performed sublexical and lexical identification tasks. As in Experiment 1, there was evidence a) of a close correspondence between sublexical and lexical processing and b) for obligatory sublexical processing. However, there were some dependent measures that failed to support the obligatory sublexical processing framework. Dual route models additionally claim that pSTM depends on the brain regions involved in perception, including a sensory-motor interface region involved in rehearsal (e.g., Hickock & Poeppel, 2000). In contrast, traditional models of pSTM assume a phonological maintenance buffer separate from perceptual processes (Martin & Breedin, 1992). In Experiment 3 we found behavioral and structural neuroimaging (lesion-symptom mapping) support for the buffer approach, though no significant results were found in attempts to localize sublexical and lexical processing.

Abstract = {This study is a cross-sectional investigation into the relationship among Japanese EFL learners' vocabulary size, two aspects of depth of vocabulary knowledge, polysemy and collocational knowledge, and automaticity of word recognition specified as orthographic decoding speed and lexical meaning access speed, and the roles these aspects of lexical knowledge play in general academic reading comprehension as well as in each of five Reading Comprehension item types---Main Idea, Stated Details, Paraphrased Details, Guessing Vocabulary from Context, and Making Inferences. The participants (N = 166) were first- and second-year, non-English majors at a four-year, co-educational university in western Japan. The participants were gathered from seven intact classes, where they focused on developing reading skills for TOEIC. Data were obtained from six major instruments: the Reading Comprehension Test, the Vocabulary Size Measure, the Revised Word Associates Polysemy Test, the Revised Word Associates Collocation Test, the Lexical Decision Task, and the Antonym Semantic Decision Task. The first four tests were administered with pencil and paper over two months, and the latter two tests were administered during the summer vacation with individual participants using computer software that produced reaction time data. Before conducting the quantitative analyses, the paper and pencil based tests were analyzed using the Rasch dichotomous model to examine the validity and reliability of the instruments and to transform the raw scores into equal interval Rasch measures. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate how these aspects of lexical knowledge were related, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine to what extent these aspects of lexical knowledge contributed to the prediction of general reading comprehension as well as each of the five reading comprehension item types. The results showed strong correlations among the Vocabulary Size Measure, the Revised Word Associates Polysemy Test, and the Revised Word Associates Collocation Test, which suggested that vocabulary size and depth of vocabulary knowledge are closely related. This indicated that the more learners expand their written receptive vocabulary, the more likely they are to learn about various aspects of those words, such as their common collocation. On the contrary, none of the three lexical knowledge tests correlated significantly with the Lexical Decision Task and the Antonym Semantic Decision Task, which suggested that increases in vocabulary size and depth of lexical knowledge were not accompanied by the development of faster recognition of orthographic form or faster access to word meaning. Hence, this result implied that developing greater speed of lexical access lags behind increases in overall vocabulary size. Furthermore, the micro-analysis of 12 anchor words indicated that item dependency and considerable individual variation for each anchor word was present for the three aspects of lexical knowledge. The results also indicated that both vocabulary size and depth of lexical knowledge play significant roles in academic reading comprehension. Moreover, the two aspects of depth of vocabulary, polysemy and collocational knowledge, made unique contributions to the prediction of academic reading comprehension, which suggested that as learners' vocabulary size approaches 3,000 words families, depth of lexical knowledge becomes increasingly important for academic reading comprehension. In a similar vein, the strong correlations among Guessing Vocabulary from Context item type, vocabulary size, and the two aspects of depth of vocabulary knowledge suggested that successful lexical guessing requires both a reasonably large vocabulary size and depth of lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {The cross-language relationship of lexical knowledge between typologically dissimilar languages has not received much attention in previous studies. The relationship between lexical depth and reading comprehension in English and Mandarin was thus investigated in two studies. In Study 1, 139 Mandarin-English speaking children (n= 87, aged 8-9 years; n= 52, aged 10-11 years) completed parallel measures of two aspects of lexical depth, paradigmatic and syntagmatic knowledge in both English and Mandarin, along with measures of lexical breadth and non-verbal reasoning. Regression analyses showed a cross-language relationship for paradigmatic but not syntagmatic knowledge for both the younger and older children. In Study 2, the same children were measured for working memory, word reading, morphological awareness and reading comprehension in both languages in addition to the measures used in Study 1. Paradigmatic knowledge was found to be a significant predictor of reading comprehension in both languages but syntagmatic knowledge was a unique predictor only for comprehension in Mandarin for both age cohorts. A cross-language relationship was only observed in the older children between Mandarin paradigmatic knowledge and English reading comprehension. Study 1 results provide evidence of a link between the mental lexicons of both languages in Mandarin-English speaking children at the paradigmatic level. Study 2 findings point to the importance of lexical depth in reading comprehension in both English and Mandarin. The cross-language paradigmatic knowledge-reading comprehension link was found in bilingual children learning contrasting languages but was limited to older children. These findings have implications for instructional practice to facilitate lexical development in bilingual children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Recent research investigating embedded stem priming effects with the masked priming paradigm and pseudoword primes (e.g., quickify–quick) has shown that priming effects can be obtained even when the embedded target word is followed by a non-morphological ending (e.g., quickald–quick). Here we examine the specific nature of such priming effects by testing whether they are modulated by morphological family size. We reasoned that if the effects are driven by pre-lexical orthographic processing then they should not be influenced by the family size of the embedded target word. On the contrary, we found that embedded words having several morphologically related family members (e.g., serpentoche–SERPENT [English: snakerel–SNAKE]—serpents, serpentin, serpentine, serpenter, serpentant) generated greater priming than embedded words having only the plural form in the morphological family (e.g., dauphingri–DAUPHIN [English: dolphinald–DOLPHIN]). We therefore conclude that embedded stem priming is at least partly driven by processing at the level of lexical and morpho-semantic representations.

Abstract = {This paper presents a new method of analysis by which structural similarities between brain data and linguistic data can be assessed at the semantic level. It shows how to measure the strength of these structural similarities and so determine the relatively better fit of the brain data with one semantic model over another. The first model is derived from WordNet, a lexical database of English compiled by language experts. The second is given by the corpus-based statistical technique of latent semantic analysis (LSA), which detects relations between words that are latent or hidden in text. The brain data are drawn from experiments in which statements about the geography of Europe were presented auditorily to participants who were asked to determine their truth or falsity while electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made. The theoretical framework for the analysis of the brain and semantic data derives from axiomatizations of theories such as the theory of differences in utility )},

Abstract = {Learning vocabulary and understanding texts present difficulty for language learners due to, among other things, the high degree of lexical ambiguity. By developing an intelligent tutoring system, this dissertation examines whether automatically providing enriched sense-specific information is effective for vocabulary learning and reading comprehension of second language learners. The system developed in this study contributes to an extended understanding of how NLP techniques can be applied more effectively in an educational environment. The system allows learners to upload texts and click on any content word in order to obtain sense-appropriate lexical information for unfamiliar or unknown words during reading. The system consists of three components: (1) the system manager controls the interaction among each learner, the NLP server, and the lexical database; (2) the NLP server converts a raw input text to a linguistically-analyzed text; (3) the lexical database is used to provide a sense-appropriate definition and example sentences of a word to the learner. To obtain the sense-appropriate information, the system first performs word sense disambiguation (WSD) on the input text. Pointing to appropriate examples tuned for language learners, however, is complicated by the fact that the database of examples is from one repository (COBUILD), while automatic WSD systems generally rely on senses from another (WordNet). The lexical database, then, is indexed by WordNet senses, each of which points to an appropriate corresponding COBUILD sense. The fact that every sense inventory has its own standards of sense distinction poses a serious problem in integrating these inventories into one. To redirect an input WordNet sense to a corresponding COBUILD sense, thus, a word sense alignment algorithm was developed, following a heuristic of favoring flatter alignment structures. With this system, an empirical study was conducted with 60 intermediate learners of English as a second language to examine whether this system can lead learners to improve their vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension. The findings show that learners demonstrated higher performance when receiving sense-specific information. Furthermore, the qualitative examination of the effect of automatic system errors show that, although learners showed learning regardless of the appropriateness of lexical information, they still showed relatively greater learning when given appropriate lexical information.

Abstract = {In this paper we focus on collocations, which have been studied in computational linguistics since they constitute a key factor when processing natural languages. For instance, they usually represent a challenge in automatic translation because the association of two terms is not easily computed. We proposed that the parser should be provided with a lexical database in order to make more effective the identification of collocations during the parsing process. We assessed this claim by using a corpus of 6'000 sentences retrieved from the British magazine The Economist Espresso. The corpus was parsed twice, first with the collocation detection component turned on and then with it turned off, and to make the comparison the Fips tagger was used. The results showed an improvement of the quality when the parser has access to collocation knowledge.

Abstract = {What determines consonant doubling in English? This question is pursued by using a large lexical database to establish systematic correlations between spelling, phonology and morphology. The main insights are: Consonant doubling is most regular at morpheme boundaries. It can be described in graphemic terms alone, i.e. without reference to phonology. In monomorphemic words, consonant doubling depends mostly on the word ending. Certain endings correlate with double consonants (e.g. (er) as in (summer), while others correlate with single consonants (e.g. <it> as in <visit>). What is more, it is the graphemic form of the word ending that determines the presence or absence of double consonants: The word endings <-ic> and <-ick>, for example, are homophonous, but the former almost always occurs with single consonants (e.g. <panic>), the latter with double consonants (e.g. <derrick>). That makes graphemic word endings peculiar entities: Like suffixes, they are recurring and they have distributional properties--but unlike suffixes, they have no morphosyntactic or semantic function.},

Abstract = {Considering the popularity of the Internet, an automatic interactive feedback system for E-learning websites is becoming increasingly desirable. However, computers still have problems understanding natural languages, especially the Chinese language, firstly because the Chinese language has no space to segment lexical entries (its segmentation method is more difficult than that of English) and secondly because of the lack of a complete grammar in the Chinese language, making parsing more difficult and complicated. Building an automated Chinese feedback system for special application domains could solve these problems. This paper proposes an interactive feedback mechanism in a virtual campus that can parse, understand and respond to Chinese sentences. This mechanism utilizes a specific lexical database according to the particular application. In this way, a virtual campus website can implement a special application domain that chooses the proper response in a user friendly, accurate and)},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether the bilingual status of 56 typically developing children aged 60–69 months influenced their lexical abilities. The participants were identified as Maltese-dominant (Me) (n = 21), English-dominant (Em) (n = 15) and balanced bilingual (ME) (n = 20) on the basis of language exposure and proficiency, as reported by their parents. Comprehension and production of nouns and verbs were measured using Cross-Linguistic Lexical Tasks (LITMUS-CLT) in Maltese (CLT-MT) and British English (CLT-EN). Significant effects of bilingual group were identified for performance on lexical comprehension. For production, consistent bilingual group effects resulted when accurate concepts lexicalised in the test language were scored. Lexical mixing was more pronounced when children were tested in their non-dominant language. Maltese noun production elicited the highest levels of mixing across all groups. Findings point towards the need to consider specific exposure dynamics to each language within a single language pair when assessing children’s bilingual lexical skills.

Abstract = {Purpose: This follow-up study assessed (a) the influence of phonological working memory (pWM), home literacy environment, and a family history of linguistic impairments in late talkers (LTs); (b) the diagnostic accuracy of a task of nonword repetition (NWR) in identifying LTs; and (c) the persistence of lexical weaknesses after 10 months. Method: Two hundred ninety-three children were assessed at approximately 32 (t1) and 41 (t2) months. At t1, they were administered the Italian adaptation of the Language Development Survey, an NWR task (used to assess pWM), and questionnaires assessing home literacy environment and family history of language impairments. Thirty-three LTs were identified. The linguistic skills of the participants were evaluated at t2 by administering tasks assessing Articulation, Naming, Semantic Fluency, and Lexical Comprehension. Results: At t2, LTs performed more poorly as compared with age-matched typically developing peers in articulatory and naming skills, had reduced lexical comprehension abilities, and had limited lexical knowledge. Their performance on the NWR task at t1 correlated with the extension of their vocabularies at t2 (as estimated with a Semantic Fluency task). Conclusions: The Language Development Survey recently adapted to Italian is sensitive to LTs. Former LTs still have a mild lexical delay at approximately 40 months. As an indirect measure of pWM, the task of NWR is an early indicator of future lexical deficits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Although lexical tone is a highly prevalent phonetic cue in human languages, its role in bilingual spoken word recognition is not well understood. The present study investigates whether and how adult bilinguals, who use pitch contours to disambiguate lexical items in one language but not the other, access a tonal L1 when exclusively processing a non-tonal L2. Using the visual world paradigm, we show that Mandarin-English listeners automatically activated Mandarin translation equivalents of English target words such as ‘rain’ (Mandarin ‘yu3’), and consequently were distracted by competitors whose segments and tones overlapped with the translations of English target words (‘feather’, also ‘yu3’ in Mandarin). Importantly, listeners were not distracted by competitors that overlapped with the translations of target words in all segments but not tone (‘fish’; Mandarin ‘yu2’), nor were they distracted by competitors that overlapped with the translations of target words in rime and tone (‘wheat’, Mandarin ‘gu3’). These novel results demonstrate implicit access to L1 lexical representations through automatic/unconscious translation, as a result of cross-language top-down and/or lateral influence, and highlight the critical role of lexical tone activation in bilingual lexical access.

Abstract = {The lexical-decision task is among the most commonly used paradigms in psycholinguistics. In both the signal-detection theory and Diffusion Decision Model (DDM; Ratcliff, Gomez, & McKoon, Psychological Review, 111, 159–182, 2004) frameworks, lexical-decisions are based on a continuous source of word-likeness evidence for both words and non-words. The Retrieving Effectively from Memory model of Lexical-Decision (REM–LD; Wagenmakers et al., Cognitive Psychology, 48(3), 332–367, 2004) provides a comprehensive explanation of lexical-decision data and makes the prediction that word-likeness evidence is more variable for words than non-words and that higher frequency words are more variable than lower frequency words. To test these predictions, we analyzed five lexical-decision data sets with the DDM. For all data sets, drift-rate variability changed across word frequency and non-word conditions. For the most part, REM–LD’s predictions about the ordering of evidence variability across stimuli in the lexical-decision task were confirmed.

Abstract = {Readers' eye movements were recorded to examine the role of character positional frequency on Chinese lexical acquisition during reading and its possible modulation by word spacing. In Experiment 1, three types of pseudowords were constructed based on each character's positional frequency, providing congruent, incongruent, and no positional word segmentation information. Each pseudoword was embedded into two sets of sentences, for the learning and the test phases. In the learning phase, half the participants read sentences in word-spaced format, and half in unspaced format. In the test phase, all participants read sentences in unspaced format. The results showed an inhibitory effect of character positional frequency upon the efficiency of word learning when processing incongruent pseudowords both in the learning and test phase, and also showed facilitatory effect of word spacing in the learning phase, but not at test. Most importantly, these two characteristics exerted independent influences on word segmentation. In Experiment 2, three analogous types of pseudowords were created whilst controlling for orthographic neighborhood size. The results of the two experiments were consistent, except that the effect of character positional frequency was absent in the test phase in Experiment 2. We argue that the positional frequency of a word's constituent characters may influence the character-to-word assignment in a process that likely incorporates both lexical segmentation and identification.

Abstract = {Neurobiological models of reading account for two ways in which orthography is converted to phonology: (1) familiar words, particularly those with exceptional spelling-sound mappings (e.g., shoe) access their whole-word lexical representations in the ventral visual stream, and (2) orthographically unfamiliar words, particularly those with regular spelling-sound mappings (i.e., pseudohomophones [PHs], which are orthographically novel but sound like real words; e.g., shue) are phonetically decoded via sublexical processing in the dorsal visual stream. The present study used a naming task in order to compare naming reaction time (RT) and response duration (RD) of exception and regular words to their PH counterparts. We replicated our earlier findings with words, and extended them to PH phonetic decoding by showing a similar effect on RT and RD of matched PHs. Given that the shorter RDs for exception words can be attributed to the benefit of whole-word processing in the orthographic word system, and the longer RTs for exception words to the conflict with phonetic decoding, our PH results demonstrate that phonetic decoding also involves top-down feedback from phonological lexical representations (e.g., activated by shue) to the orthographic representations of the corresponding correct word (e.g., shoe). Two computational models were tested for their ability to account for these effects: the DRC and the CDP +. The CDP + fared best as it was capable of simulating both the regularity and stimulus type effect on RT for both word and PH identification, although not their over-additive interaction. Our results demonstrate that both lexical reading and phonetic decoding elicit a regularity dissociation between RT and RD that provides important constraints to all models of reading, and that phonetic decoding results in top-down feedback that bolsters the orthographic lexical reading process.

A clear repetition priming effect was observed in an early time-window spanning 100–200 ms post-target onset, and the effect continued after target word offset in a time-window between 650 and 800 ms. Crucially, we observed that talker change caused a diminution in repetition priming only in the N400 time-window, and only for low frequency words but not for high frequency words. Together, our findings suggest that spoken word recognition relies primarily on abstract representations, and that talker-specific information mainly affects later stages of this process, namely lexical selection.

Abstract = {Visual information influences speech perception in both infants and adults. It is still unknown whether lexical representations are multisensory. To address this question, we exposed 18‐month‐old infants (n = 32) and adults (n = 32) to new word–object pairings: Participants either heard the acoustic form of the words or saw the talking face in silence. They were then tested on recognition in the same or the other modality. Both 18‐month‐old infants and adults learned the lexical mappings when the words were presented auditorily and recognized the mapping at test when the word was presented in either modality, but only adults learned new words in a visual‐only presentation. These results suggest developmental changes in the sensory format of lexical representations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {On the basis of the analysis of a sample of data drawn from the large English corpus enTenTen13, the present paper provides an account of the caused-motion pattern which calls for caution on the radial network view of argument structure, common among proponents of Construction Grammar In my study, I first analyzed a sample of occurrences which are supposed to instantiate the central sense of this grammatical pattern; then, I considered a few instances of the supposed semantic extensions of the pattern. Based on my findings, I claim that the distinction between a set of different senses is less than convincing. Instead, I propose that the different realizations of the pattern are better characterized as standing in a relationship of family resemblance, sharing a common syntactic structure and only a very general meaning denoting a change of circumstances. This flexible approach allows capturing the peculiarities of the different instantiations by positing a series of low-level generalizations based on specific senses of the lexical items.

Abstract = {Numerous studies suggest that audiovisual speech influences lexical processing. However, it is not clear which stages of lexical processing are modulated by audiovisual speech. In this study, we examined the time course of the access to word representations in long‐term memory when they were presented in auditory‐only and audiovisual modalities. We exploited the effect of the prior access to a word on the subsequent access to that word known as the word repetition effect. Using event‐related potentials, we identified an early time window at about 200 milliseconds and a late time window starting at about 400 milliseconds related to the word repetition effect. Our results showed that the word repetition effect over the early time window was modulated by the speech modality while this influence of speech modality was not found over the late time window. Visual cues thus play a role in the early stages of lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Numerous studies indicate that lexical decision is a dynamic process in which various sources of information (e.g., orthographic, phonological, lexical) need to be integrated over time and that mismatches between these sources produce uncertainty during decision-making. However, the specific contribution of these different sources of information to the decision process, and the specific ways they interact over time, are still incompletely understood. Here we report two experiments conducted to investigate the role of a key characteristic of language—Orthographic consistency—In modulating reading strategies in a lexical decision task. We aimed to test different theories of how exactly orthographic consistency influences decisions, and the ways lexical and sublexical representations are matched within it. For this, we exploited a key characteristic of the French language: the fact that retrieving spelling from phonology is hard, whereas the reverse is not the case (i.e., French is feedback-inconsistent but feedforward-consistent). Our results indicate a feedback inconsistency effect: uncertainty in our lexical decision task originates from the process of retrieving spelling from phonology, not when retrieving phonology from spelling. These results support the idea of a verification mechanism that compares orthographic sublexical information with lexical information during lexical decisions.

Children gave earlier AoA estimates than the three adult groups; this was true for high-frequency as well as low-frequency words. In addition to the means and standard deviations of the AoA estimates, we report word frequency, concreteness, and imageability ratings, as well as word length measures (numbers of syllables and letters), for the 600 words as supplemental materials.

Abstract = {Previous studies on the processing of lexical tones have typically confounded effects due to phonological information (different meanings of words signalled by syllables with different tonal categories) with effects due to specific acoustic information (pitch type: pitch height/pitch contour). The present study is designed to dissociate these two kinds of effects and further investigate the processing of lexical tones at pre-attentive stage by mismatch negativity (MMN). We chose level tones and contour tones in Cantonese to differentiate pitch height from pitch contour, and manipulated tonal category (within-category/across-category) to distinguish phonological information from acoustic information. The results showed clear interactions between tonal category and pitch type in MMN mean amplitude and peak latency, suggesting the interaction between phonological information and pitch type in the pre-attentive processing of lexical tones. These results are discussed in light of cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying auditory processing of lexical tones. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This narrative review discusses quantitative indices measuring differences between alphabetic languages that are related to the process of word recognition. The specific orthography that a child is acquiring has been identified as a central element influencing reading acquisition and dyslexia. However, the development of reliable metrics to measure differences between language scripts hasn’t received much attention so far. This paper therefore reviews metrics proposed in the literature for quantifying orthographic transparency, syllabic complexity, and morphological complexity of alphabetic languages. The review included searches of Web of Science, PubMed, PsychInfo, Google Scholar, and various online sources. Search terms pertained to orthographic transparency, morphological complexity, and syllabic complexity in relation to reading acquisition, and dyslexia. Although the predictive value of these metrics is promising, more research is needed to validate the value of the metrics discussed and to understand the ‘developmental footprint’ of orthographic transparency, morphological complexity, and syllabic complexity in the lexical organization and processing strategies.

Abstract = {Do skilled readers of opaque and transparent orthographies make differential use of lexical and sublexical processes when converting words from print to sound? Two experiments are reported, which address that question, using effects of letter length on naming latencies as an index of the involvement of sublexical letter–sound conversion. Adult native speakers of English (Experiment 1) and Spanish (Experiment 2) read aloud four- and seven-letter high-frequency words, low-frequency words, and nonwords in their native language. The stimuli were interleaved and presented 10 times in a first testing session and 10 more times in a second session 28 days later. Effects of lexicality were observed in both languages, indicating the deployment of lexical representations in word naming. Naming latencies to both words and nonwords reduced across repetitions on Day 1, with those savings being retained to Day 28. Length effects were, however, greater for Spanish than English word naming. Reaction times to long and short nonwords converged with repeated presentations in both languages, but less in Spanish than in English. The results support the hypothesis that reading in opaque orthographies favours the rapid creation and use of lexical representations, while reading in transparent orthographies makes more use of a combination of lexical and sublexical processing.

Abstract = {Here I present the background to, and a description of, a newly developed database of historical and contemporary lexical data for Australian languages (Chirila), concentrating on the Pama-Nyungan family (the largest family in the country). While the database was initially developed in order to facilitate research on cognate words and reconstructions, it has had many uses beyond its original purpose, in synchronic theoretical linguistics, language documentation, and language reclamation. Creating a multi-audience database of this type has been challenging, however. Some of the challenges stemmed from success: as the size of the database grew, the original data structure became unwieldy. Other challenges grew from the difficulties in anticipating future needs, in keeping track of materials, and in coping with diverse input formats for so many highly endangered languages. In this paper I document the structure of the database, provide an overview of its uses (both in diachronic and synchronic research), and discuss some of the issues that have arisen during the project and choices that needed to be made as the database was created, compiled, curated, and shared. I address here the major problems that arise with linguistic data, particularly databases created for diverse audiences, from diverse data, with little infrastructure support.},

Abstract = {Researchers have focused for decades on how young children learn individual words. However, they have paid less attention to how children organize their word knowledge into the network of representations that underlies our ability to retrieve the right words efficiently and flexibly when we need them. Although methodological limits have made it difficult to study the development of lexical–semantic networks, in recent work with new paradigms, infants and toddlers have shown that they organize their vocabulary systematically via both categorical and associative relations from around age 2. Combined with work demonstrating that lexical–semantic relations affect early comprehension, production, and learning, this emerging area of research suggests that scientists and practitioners would benefit from more comprehensive theories of language learning that include not only vocabulary development, but also the development of lexical–semantic networks.

Abstract = {For successful language comprehension, bilinguals often must exert top-down control to access and select lexical representations within a single language. These control processes may critically depend on identification of the language to which a word belongs, but it is currently unclear when different sources of such language membership information become available during word recognition. In the present study, we used event-related potentials to investigate the time course of influence of orthographic language membership cues. Using an oddball detection paradigm, we observed early neural effects of orthographic bias (Spanish vs. English orthography) that preceded effects of lexicality (word vs. pseudoword). This early orthographic pop-out effect was observed for both words and pseudowords, suggesting that this cue is available prior to full lexical access. We discuss the role of orthographic bias for models of bilingual word recognition and its potential role in the suppression of nontarget lexical information.

The children were administered unconstrained, phonemic and semantic VFTs with a duration of 150 or 120 s, respectively. Both age and school type influenced all variables and in terms of performance over time. Older children and private school students outperformed the remainder of the sample, with the first 30 s of each VFT usually being the most productive. Although the size of the clusters produced did not differ between groups, the types of clusters did show some variations, with semantic clusters being the most frequent. Our results revealed strong correlations between switching ability and word production in all three VFTs. In conclusion, the executive functions known as planning and cognitive flexibility play a crucial role in word production by organising and facilitating the recall of lexical information from memory.

We hypothesized that if these 2 words were processed in parallel in the parafovea then we may observe significant preview benefits for the condition in which the letters were transposed between words relative to the condition in which the letters were substituted. However, no such effect was observed, with participants fixating the words for the same amount of time in both conditions.

Abstract = {With the development of ICT, digital writing is becoming much more common in people’s life. Differently from keyboarding alphabets directly to input English words, keyboarding Chinese character is always through typing phonetic alphabets and then identify the glyph provided by Pinyin input-method software while in this process which do not need users to produce orthography spelling, thus it is different from traditional written language production model based on handwriting process. Much of the research in this domain has found that using Pinyin input method is beneficial to Chinese characters recognition, but only a small part explored the effects of individual’s Pinyin input experience on the Chinese characters production process. We ask whether using Pinyin input-method will strengthen the semantic-phonology linkage or semantic-orthography linkage in Chinese character mental lexicon. Through recording the RT and accuracy of participants completing semantic-syllable and semantic-glyph consistency judgments, the results found the accuracy of semantic-syllable consistency judgments in high Pinyin input experienced group was higher than that in low-experienced group, and RT was reversed. There were no significant differences on semantic-glyph consistency judgments between the two groups. We conclude that using Pinyin input method in Chinese digital writing can strengthen the semantic-phonology linkage while do not weakening the semantic-orthography linkage in mental lexicon at the same time, which means that Pinyin input method is beneficial to lexical processing involving Chinese cognition.

Abstract = {Assessment of text readability is important for assigning texts at the appropriate level to readers at different proficiency levels. The present research approached readability assessment from the lexical perspective of word frequencies derived from corpora assumed to reflect typical language experience. Three studies were conducted to test how the word‐level feature of word frequency can be aggregated to characterise text‐level readability. The results show that an effective use of word frequency for text readability assessment should take a range of characteristics of the distribution of words frequencies into account. For characterizing text readability, taking into account the standard deviation in addition to the mean word frequencies already significantly increases results. The best results are obtained using the mean frequencies of the words in language frequency bands or in bands obtained by agglomerative clustering of the word frequencies in the documents – though a comparison of within‐corpus and cross‐corpus results shows the limited generalizability of using high numbers of fine‐grained frequency bands. Overall, the study advances our understanding of the relationship between word frequency and text readability and provides concrete options for more effectively making use of lexical frequency information in practice.

Abstract = {Although benign, rolandic epilepsy (RE) or benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes is often associated with language impairment. Recently, fronto-rolandic EEG abnormalities have been described in children with developmental dysphasia (DD), suggesting an interaction between language impairment and interictal epileptiform discharges. To investigate if a behavioral-linguistic continuum between RE and DD exists, a clinical prospective study was carried out to evaluate the language profile of 15 children with RE and 22 children with DD. Language skills were assessed using an extensive, standardized test battery. Language was found to be impaired in both study groups, however RE and DD were associated with distinct language impairment profiles. Children with RE had difficulties with sentence comprehension, semantic verbal fluency and auditory short-term memory, which are unrelated to age of epilepsy onset and laterality of epileptic focus. In children with DD, sentence comprehension and verbal fluency were among their relative strengths, whereas sentence and lexical production constituted relative weaknesses.

Abstract = {Models of written word recognition in languages using the Roman alphabet assume that a word’s visual form is quickly mapped onto abstract units. This proposal is consistent with the finding that masked priming effects are of similar magnitude from lowercase, uppercase, and alternating-case primes (e.g., beard–BEARD, BEARD–BEARD, and BeArD–BEARD). We examined whether this claim can be readily generalized to the 2 syllabaries of Japanese Kana (Hiragana and Katakana). The specific rationale was that if the visual form of Kana words is lost early in the lexical access process, alternating-script repetition primes should be as effective as same-script repetition primes at activating a target word. Results showed that alternating-script repetition primes were less effective at activating lexical representations of Katakana words than same-script repetition primes—indeed, they were no more effective than partial primes that contained only the Katakana characters from the alternating-script primes.

Abstract = {A large body of literature has characterized unimodal monolingual and bilingual lexicons and how neighborhood density affects lexical access; however there have been relatively fewer studies that generalize these findings to bimodal (M2) second language (L2) learners of sign languages. The goal of the current study was to investigate parallel language activation in M2L2 learners of sign language and to characterize the influence of spoken language and sign language neighborhood density on the activation of ASL signs. A priming paradigm was used in which the neighbors of the sign target were activated with a spoken English word and compared the activation of the targets in sparse and dense neighborhoods. Neighborhood density effects in auditory primed lexical decision task were then compared to previous reports of native deaf signers who were only processing sign language. Results indicated reversed neighborhood density effects in M2L2 learners relative to those in deaf signers such that there were inhibitory effects of handshape density and facilitatory effects of location density. Additionally, increased inhibition for signs in dense handshape neighborhoods was greater for high proficiency L2 learners. These findings support recent models of the hearing bimodal bilingual lexicon, which posit lateral links between spoken language and sign language lexical representations.

Abstract = {Paraphrase identification is a semantic text similarity task which is an important part of many natural language processing applications. Existing methods use vector space models, word co-occurrence information, lexical databases, parsers and machine translation (MT) evaluation metrics to find text similarity. However, other aspects such as negations, inverse relations and semantic roles of the sentences are also very much important in identifying paraphrases. Furthermore, the semantics of the sentences are hidden when the sentences are complex. We propose an approach to find similarity between pair of texts by considering all these factors. We have used an approach to determine set of clauses present in the texts by resolving conjunctions in complex sentences that identify hidden triples from the text. The approach extracts clause-based similarity features namely concept score, relation score, proposition score and word score from the texts. We have combined these similarity features)},

Abstract = {This article addresses the question of the types of morphological relatedness that the lexical class of the adjective presents in Old English. After an exhaustive analysis of the derivational paradigms of the language based on data retrieved from the lexical database of Old English Nerthus, the following conclusions are reached. Two types of morphological relatedness are identifiable, namely explicit and implicit. Short distance and long distance relations overlap with explicit and implicit morphological relatedness. These relations involve four types of units, to wit lexical primes (the bases of lexical paradigms), derived adjectives (the input to recursive processes of word-formation), target adjectives (the output of processes that cannot be inputted to a recursive process) and morphologically unrelated adjectives (which are neither the input nor the output of a process of word-formation).

The lexical and semantic variables in the database include frequency, regularity, familiarity, consistency, number of strokes, homophone density, semantic ambiguity rating, phonetic combinability, semantic combinability, and the number of disyllabic compound words formed by a character. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the predictive powers of these variables for the naming RTs. The results demonstrated that these variables could account for a significant portion of variance (55.8 %) in the naming RTs. An additional multiple regression analysis was conducted to demonstrate the effects of consistency and character frequency.

Abstract = {Words matter in scientific practice. They matter because they can facilitate or hamper clear communication among scientists about phenomena, which are often complex. They also matter because they impact the clarity of communication between scientists and the lay public. Words, if properly formulated, afford economical communication and enable the successful pursuit of scientific goals such as accurate interpretation of findings and facilitation of procedural replication. They influence the ways scientists view their subject matter, the manner in which they make interpretations, and the ways that terminology affects conceptual understanding. As such, scientific communities attend to the controlling effects their words have on their behavior. Finally, scientific communities take substantial measures to protect their precise subject-specific terminological use. They accomplish this through the arrangement of contingencies that socialize junior members in terminological precision and weaken or prevent subsequent terminological drift. Because consequent events are usually necessary to maintain behavior, the cognitive and behavioral verbal community must ensure its participants contact reinforcement for appropriate terminological use.

The research reported in this volume has identified several fundamental issues in pronunciation-focused task design that are discussed in detail and on which suggestions for further research are outlined. One crucial issue is how attention to pronunciation resulting in language-related episodes effectively leads to robust gains in accuracy. Another important aspect discussed is the need to adapt task design features to the phonological domain under focus and how to incorporate systematic patterns of first language interference into the task structure. Finally, we propose that future research in task-based pronunciation teaching and second language phonetics and phonology should systematically examine learner factors known to affect task performance and task features established in the research domains of lexical and grammatical development.

Abstract = {While most models of visual word identification and reading posit that a word's visual codes are rapidly transformed onto case-invariant representations (i.e., table and TABLE would equally activate the word unit corresponding to 'table'), a number of experiments have shown a lowercase advantage in various word identification and reading tasks. In the present experiment, we examined the locus of this lowercase advantage by comparing the pattern of eye movements when reading sentences in lowercase vs. uppercase. Each sentence contained a target word that was high or low in word-frequency. Overall, results showed faster reading times for lowercase than for uppercase sentences. More important, while the word-frequency effect was sizeable in the first-fixation durations on the target word, the lowercase advantage only arose in the gaze durations (i.e., the sum of durations of first-pass fixations on the target word, including refixations). Furthermore, we found an effect of word-frequency, but not of letter case, in the first-fixation duration on target words with multiple first-pass fixations. Taken together, these findings suggest that the lowercase advantage reflects operations that do not occur in the initial contact with the lexical entries.

Abstract = {Children learn new words via their everyday reading experience but little is known about how this learning happens. We addressed this by focusing on the conditions needed for new words to become familiar to children, drawing a distinction between lexical configuration (the acquisition of word knowledge) and lexical engagement (the emergence of interactive processes between newly learned words and existing words). In Experiment 1, 9–11-year-olds saw unfamiliar words in one of two storybook conditions, differing in degree of focus on the new words but matched for frequency of exposure. Children showed good learning of the novel words in terms of both configuration (form and meaning) and engagement (lexical competition). A frequency manipulation under incidental learning conditions in Experiment 2 revealed different time-courses of learning: a fast lexical configuration process, indexed by explicit knowledge, and a slower lexicalization process, indexed by lexical competition.

Using new neighborhood density and frequency measures, the general lexical decision task yielded an inhibitory cross-lingual neighborhood density effect on reading times of second language words, replicating van Heuven, Dijkstra, and Grainger (1998). Reaction times for native language words were not influenced by neighborhood density or frequency but error rates showed cross-lingual neighborhood effects depending on target word frequency. The large-scale eye movement corpus confirmed effects of cross-lingual neighborhood on natural reading, even though participants were reading a novel in a unilingual context. Especially second language reading and to a lesser extent native language reading were influenced by lexical candidates from the nontarget language, although these effects in natural reading were largely facilitatory. These results offer strong and direct support for bilingual word recognition models that assume language-independent lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Behavioral experiments have revealed that words appearing in many different contexts are responded to faster than words that appear in few contexts. Although this contextual diversity (CD) effect has been found to be stronger than the word-frequency (WF) effect, it is a matter of debate whether the facilitative effects of CD and WF reflect the same underlying mechanisms. The analysis of the electrophysiological correlates of CD may shed some light on this issue. This experiment is the first to examine the ERPs to high- and low-CD words when WF is controlled for. Results revealed that while high-CD words produced faster responses than low-CD words, their ERPs showed larger negativities (225–325 ms) than low-CD words. This result goes in the opposite direction of the ERP WF effect (high-frequency words elicit smaller N400 amplitudes than low-frequency words). The direction and scalp distribution of the CD effect resembled the ERP effects associated with 'semantic richness.' Thus, while apparently related, CD and WF originate from different sources during the access of lexical-semantic representations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Although previous research has demonstrated the efficacy of recasts on second language (L2) morphology and lexis (e.g., Li, 2010; Mackey & Goo, 2007), few studies have examined their effect on learners’ phonological development (although see Saito, 2015; Saito & Lyster, 2012). The current study investigates the impact of recasts on the development of lexical stress, defined as the placement of emphasis on a particular syllable within a word by making it louder and longer, in oral synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) and face-to-face (FTF) interaction. Using a pretest-posttest design, intermediate learners of English were randomly assigned to one of four groups: FTF recast, SCMC recast, FTF control, or SCMC control. Pre- and posttests consisted of sentence-reading and information-exchange tasks, while the treatment was an interactive role-play task. Syllable duration, intensity, and pitch were used to analyze learners’ development of stress placement. The statistical analyses of the acoustic correlates did not yield significant differences. However, the observed patterns suggest that there is need for further investigation to understand the relationship between recasts and development of lexical stress.

Abstract = {Although older adults exhibit normal accuracy in performing word retrieval and generation (lexical production; e.g., object naming), they are generally slower in responding than younger adults. To maintain accuracy, older adults recruit compensatory mechanisms and strategies. We focused on two such possible compensatory mechanisms, one semantic and one executive. These mechanisms are reflected at inter- and intra-hemispheric levels by various patterns of reorganization of lexical production cerebral networks. Hemispheric reorganization (HR) changes were also evaluated in relation to increase naming latencies. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined 27 healthy participants (from 30 years to 85 years) during an object naming task, exploring and identifying task-related patterns of cerebral reorganization. We report two main results. First, we observed a left intrahemispheric pattern of reorganization, the left anterior-posterior aging (LAPA) effect, consisting of supplementary activation of left posterior (temporo-parietal) regions in older adults and asymmetric activation along the left fronto-temporal axis. This pattern suggests that older adults recruit posterior semantic regions to perform object naming. The second finding consisted of bilateral recruitment of frontal regions to maintain appropriate response times, especially in older adults who were faster performers. This pattern is discussed in terms of compensatory mechanism. We suggest that aging is associated with multiple, co-existing compensation and reorganization mechanisms and patterns associated with lexical production.

Abstract = {Every word signifies multiple senses. Many studies using comprehension‐based measures suggest that polysemes’ senses (e.g., paper as in printer paper or term paper) share lexical representations, whereas homophones’ meanings (e.g., pen as in ballpoint pen or pig pen) correspond to distinct lexical representations. Less is known about the lexical representations of polysemes compared to homophones in language production. In this study, speakers named pictures after reading sentence fragments that primed polysemes and homophones either as direct competitors to pictures (i.e., semantic‐competitors), or as indirect‐competitors to pictures (e.g., polysemous senses of semantic competitors, or homophonous meanings of semantic competitors). Polysemes (e.g., paper) elicited equal numbers of intrusions to picture names (e.g., cardboard) compared to in control conditions whether primed as direct competitors (printer paper) or as indirect‐competitors (term paper). This contrasted with the finding that homophones (e.g., pen) elicited more intrusions to picture names (e.g., crayon) compared to in control conditions when primed as direct competitors (ballpoint pen) than when primed as indirect‐competitors (pig pen). These results suggest that polysemes, unlike homophones, are stored and retrieved as unified lexical representations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Bilingualism has been found to delay onset of dementia and this has been attributed to an advantage in executive control in bilinguals. However, the relationship between bilingualism and cognition is complex, with costs as well as benefits to language functions. To further explore the cognitive consequences of bilingualism, the study used Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes, to examine whether bilingualism modifies the age at onset of behavioral and language variants of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) differently. Case records of 193 patients presenting with FTD (121 of them bilingual) were examined and the age at onset of the first symptoms were compared between monolinguals and bilinguals. A significant effect of bilingualism delaying the age at onset of dementia was found in behavioral variant FTD (5.7 years) but not in progressive nonfluent aphasia (0.7 years), semantic dementia (0.5 years), corticobasal syndrome (0.4 years), progressive supranuclear palsy (4.3 years) and FTD-motor neuron disease (3 years). On dividing all patients predominantly behavioral and predominantly aphasic groups, age at onset in the bilingual behavioral group (62.6) was over 6 years higher than in the monolingual patients (56.5, p = 0.006), while there was no difference in the aphasic FTD group (60.9 vs. 60.6 years, p = 0.851). The bilingual effect on age of bvFTD onset was shown independently of other potential confounding factors such as education, gender, occupation, and urban vs rural dwelling of subjects. To conclude, bilingualism delays the age at onset in the behavioral but not in the aphasic variants of FTD. The results are in line with similar findings based on research in stroke and with the current views of the interaction between bilingualism and cognition, pointing to advantages in executive functions and disadvantages in lexical tasks.

How do toddlers prioritize these properties when recognizing familiar words, and are there systematic differences among children?

On some trials, objects were typically colored (e.g., Holstein cow and pink pig); on other trials, colors were switched (e.g., pink cow and Holstein‐patterned pig). On each trial, toddlers were directed to find a target object. Overall, recognition was disrupted when colors were switched, as measured by eye movements. Moreover, individual differences in vocabularies predicted recognition differences: Toddlers who say fewer shape‐based words were more disrupted by color switches. 'Knowing' a word may not mean the same thing for all toddlers; different toddlers prioritize different facets of familiar objects in their lexical representations.

Abstract = {The present experiments focused on how orthographic processing develops during reading acquisition. Specifically, a large, cross‐sectional sample of children from grade 2 to grade 4 was exposed to pairs of words, pseudowords, digit strings, and pseudo‐letter (Armenian) strings while their sensitivity to transpositions (T) and substitutions (S) of internal characters was investigated in a perceptual matching task. The results showed that the development of identity and position decoding diverged between the four stimulus categories. Most importantly, sensitivity improved with longer exposure to formal education and higher reading level to both S and T pairs for digit strings, but only to S pairs for words and pseudowords. The results were successfully reproduced in two small independent samples. We propose a general framework, the Adaptive Specialization Hypothesis, to accommodate the results. According to this hypothesis, the transposed‐letter effect is not a hard‐wired feature of the orthographic processing system but an adaptive response of the developing orthographic system to the constraints of lexical access in several orthographies.

Abstract = {Two experiments investigated the contribution of lexical knowledge to processing nasal flap variants (e.g. 'mental' produced as 'mennle'). High and low variant production frequency nasal flap words and nonword counterparts were presented in a 't' detection task. More 't' detections were found in high than low variant frequency nasal flap words; no difference was found in control nasal flap nonwords but control nonwords with a nasal had more 't' detections than nonwords without a nasal. The findings suggest that access to lexical knowledge of an alternative NT pronunciation is modulated by variant frequency of the reduced form and pre-lexical phonotactic knowledge.

Abstract = {How do late proficient bilinguals process morphosyntactic and lexical-semantic information in their non-native language (L2)? How is this information represented in the L2 mental lexicon? And what are the neural signatures of L2 morphosyntactic and lexical-semantic processing? We addressed these questions in one behavioral and two ERP priming experiments on inflected German adjectives testing a group of advanced late Russian learners of German in comparison to native speaker (L1) controls. While in the behavioral experiment, the L2 learners performed native-like, the ERP data revealed clear L1/L2 differences with respect to the temporal dynamics of grammatical processing. Specifically, our results show that L2 morphosyntactic processing yielded temporally and spatially extended brain responses relative to L1 processing, indicating that grammatical processing of inflected words in an L2 is more demanding and less automatic than in the L1. However, this group of advanced L2 learners showed native-like lexical-semantic processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Reading impairment is frequently associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). Notwithstanding the clinical relevance of reading processes in these conditions, only a relatively small number of studies have been published on this topic so far. Aims: We investigated the reading impairment in patients with different types of neurodegenerative diseases. In the light of the marked variability in pathological changes affecting brain areas potentially relevant to reading, it could be hypothesised that these neurodegenerative conditions may lead to different patterns of reading impairment. Methods & Procedures: Three groups of patients (AD, PPA, and PCA) and a control sample of neurologically healthy participants were examined with five tasks to test the ability to read and to repeat words and nonwords, as well as with an auditory and visual lexical decision task. Outcomes & Results: No specific pattern emerged as strongly diagnostic of a specific degenerative disease. Overall, AD and PPA patients were significantly more impaired in reading nonwords than words. Lexical decision impairment in the visual modality appears to be related to PCA, while a similar deficit in the auditory modality is more suggestive of AD. A multiple single-case analysis on the reading performance was run to identify the distribution of different kinds of dyslexia: phonological dyslexia occurred in 50% of patients affected by PCA: it occurred less often in patients affected by AD (15.8%) and PPA (16.7%). Surface dyslexia occurred only in one case of AD. Age of acquisition was predictive of the reading performance for AD patients, but not for PCA and PPA patients. Conclusions: Phonological dyslexia predominates in PCA. Surface dyslexia occurred only in one AD patient. Reading nonwords was predominantly impaired in AD and PPA cases. Impairment in visual lexical decision was associated with PCA, whereas a lexical decision deficit in the auditory modality emerged in AD. Data indicate the importance of extensive testing of reading and input lexical abilities in neurodegenerative diseases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Research into anomia has been carried out in English and many Indo-European languages extensively, but not in Arabic. Previous studies have investigated predictors of successful lexical retrieval after anomia, and access to syntax during lexical retrieval. The aim of the current study is to examine impaired lexical retrieval in Arabic at two levels: predictors of lexical retrieval, and access to syntax during lexical retrieval, via checking whether syntactic cueing (using the definite article/əl-/'the' prior to nouns) facilitates noun retrieval in Arabic aphasia, with regard to naming speed and accuracy, and establishing the determinants of aphasic noun retrieval in Arabic. Three participants with anomia following CVA named 186 pictures from a published Arabic database in two conditions: bare noun condition, and determiner + noun condition. Participants' accuracy and reaction times were compared in both conditions. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis was carried out to test the effect of psycholinguistic variables (visual complexity, name agreement, age of acquisition, imageability and other intrinsic variables) on successful lexical retrieval to determine predictors of Arabic noun retrieval after anomia. The production of the determiner + noun in picture naming facilitated spoken naming in all three participants. Nouns produced with the determiner were produced faster and more accurately than their counterparts produced without the determiner. The two participants with agrammatism produced morpho-syntactic errors in the bare noun condition, but not in the determiner + noun condition, suggesting that the determiner sets up a noun phrase frame with a slot for the noun to be filled, resulting in responses that are faster and more accurate. Age of acquisition and imageability were the only two variables that had influence across the participants. These results have theoretical and clinical implications for lexical retrieval models.

Abstract = {The study investigated the impact of language impairment and environmental deprivation on Hebrew morpho-lexical development across the school years. Participants were 659 grade school and middle school Hebrew-speaking students—typically developing and language impaired, from mid-high and from low socioeconomic status (SES). They were all administered three derivational morphology tasks designed to elicit verbs, adjectives and derived abstract nouns. Each response was scored in three different ways: as a whole word, and according to its base (root or stem) and affixal (pattern or suffix) morphemes. Findings revealed three systematic hierarchies. First, the typically developing mid-high SES group always scored the highest, the language impaired low SES group always scored the lowest, while the typically developing low SES and the language impaired mid-high SES groups lay in-between. Second, verbs were the easiest category across all study groups, whilst adjectives and derived abstract nouns proved to be more affected by population type. Third, affixal morpheme always scored lower than base morpheme, with persistent gaps between the typically developing mid-high SES group and all other groups. Altogether, results show that language development is impeded extensively by both language impairment and SES factors, suggesting that in the long run, innate and environmental factors may have similar implications on morpho-lexical development.

Abstract = {Purpose: Growing evidence suggests that sentence formulation is affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD); however, how speakers with PD coordinate sentence planning and speaking remains unclear. Within 2 competing models of sentence production, this study examined whether speakers with PD show advanced buffering of words to minimize disfluencies and increased demands during speech or whether they plan one word at a time, compromising accuracy and fluency of speech. Method: Participants described 3 computer-displayed pictures using the sentence 'the A and the B are above the C.' Name agreement (codability) was varied to be high (clock) or low (sofa/couch) for each object position (A, B, C), affecting difficulty of lexical selection. Participants’ gaze durations to each object were recorded. Results: Speakers with PD showed incremental word-byword planning, retrieving only the first lexical item (A) before speech onset, similar to controls. However, they produced greater word-finding errors and disfluencies compared to controls for the low-codable pictures, but not for high-codable pictures. Conclusions: These findings suggest that by following word-by-word incremental production, speakers with PD compromise fluency and accuracy of speech to a greater extent than healthy older speakers and that PD is associated with impaired inhibitory control during lexical selection.

Abstract = {Purpose: Non-rhotic varieties of English often use /ɹ/ insertion as a connected speech process to separate heterosyllabic V₁.V₂ hiatus contexts. However, there has been little research on children’s development of this strategy. This study investigated whether children use /ɹ/ insertion and, if so, whether hiatus-breaking /ɹ/ can be considered planned, as evidenced by F3 lowering on V1. Method: Thirteen Australian English–speaking children (7 girls, 6 boys; mean age 6;1 [years;months]) participated in an elicited production task. The stimuli included carrier sentences containing 4 test words (linking /ɹ/ context: door, floor; intrusive /ɹ/ context: paw, claw) followed by of (e.g., 'This is the paw of the cat'). After familiarization containing auditory and picture prompts, children produced test sentences upon presentation of picture prompts alone. Results: Eight children produced /ɹ/ insertion; the others used (some) glottalization. The incidence of /ɹ/ did not vary across linking or intrusive contexts, and inserted /ɹ/ was associated with F3 lowering at V1 onset relative to control items without /ɹ/. Conclusion: Six-year-old Australian English–speaking children who use /ɹ/ insertion show evidence of planning ahead and inserting /ɹ/ as a segment. The implications for the development of speech-planning processes and phonological and lexical representations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study introduces a model of lexical proficiency based on novel computational indices related to word context. The indices come from an updated version of the Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Lexical Sophistication (TAALES) and include associative, lexical, and semantic measures of word context. Human ratings of holistic lexical proficiency were obtained for a spoken corpus of 240 transcribed texts produced by second language (L2) adult English learners and native English speakers (NESs). Correlations between lexical proficiency scores from trained human raters and contextual indices were examined and a regression analysis was conducted to investigate the potential for contextual indices to predict proficiency scores. Four indices accounted for approximately 42% of the variance in lexical proficiency scores in the transcribed speech samples. These indices were related to associative, lexical, and semantic operationalizations of word context. The findings demonstrate that computational measures of word context can predict human ratings of lexical proficiency and suggest that lexical, semantic, and associative context each play an important role in the development of lexical proficiency.

Abstract = {This article explores the ways in which language users make sense of metaphoricity when manifest in a variety of ways within the language. The research provides an analysis of the lexical characteristics of a single item (grew) when used in potentially, but not clearly identified, metaphoric contexts. The analysis focuses on flexible patterns of meaning and the relationship between metaphor and other aspects of figurative language such as polysemy, metonymy, and meronymy. The research stands as a follow up to a larger corpus-driven study that found differences in the lexical behavior of clearly defined metaphoric and nonmetaphoric instances of items (flame, cultivated, and grew), when looking at a large set of collocations, colligations, and semantic, pragmatic and textual associations. These behaviors or patterns are consequently avoided by the non-metaphoric instances of that same item, in order to avoid ambiguity. In the case of more ambiguous or unclear cases of metaphor, this article aims to determine if these patterns are still visible and the extent to which they signal metaphoricity. Evidence of such patterns would imply that lexical, grammatical, textual, and pragmatic manifestations in language play an important role in distinguishing between subtleties in word senses and meanings, even in the case of less obvious metaphoricity. As a consequence, awareness of these behaviors or characteristics (or lexical primings) should be at the forefront of any lexical metaphor theory.

Abstract = {This paper describes two studies that examined the lexical tone awareness of Chinese children both with and without dyslexia at different primary school ages. Study 1 examined the contributions of lexical tone awareness to distinguish children with and without dyslexia with respect to their Chinese character reading skills. Two hundred and seventy Chinese children participated in Study 1. Ninety of these were children with dyslexia (equally recruited from second, fourth, and sixth grades). Moreover, ninety children functioned as a chronological-age control group, and an additional ninety children functioned as a reading-level control group. The participants were tested for nonverbal intelligence, Chinese character reading, and cognitive-linguistic skills and lexical tone awareness. Our results revealed a later developmental ceiling in Chinese children with dyslexia than in those without dyslexia. Furthermore, children’s lexical tone awareness could serve to distinguish children with dyslexia from typically developing children in all primary school years. Study 2 compared the lexical tone awareness and Chinese character reading skills of Chinese children with dyslexia both before and after introducing the Perceptual Training Method. The participants in this study consisted of all the participants with dyslexia from Study 1, and the measurements were the Chinese character reading test and the lexical tone awareness task from Study 1. Our results revealed that only second-grade children with dyslexia gained substantially from the training on both lexical tone awareness and character naming, whereas those in the fourth grade obtained a significant improvement only on lexical tone awareness.

Abstract = {Predictive processing is a critical component of language comprehension, but exactly how and why comprehenders generate lexical predictions remains to be determined. Here, we present two experiments suggesting that lexical prediction is influenced by top-down comprehension strategies, and that lexical predictions are not always generated automatically as a function of the preceding context. In Experiment 1 (N = 24), participants read predictable and unpredictable sentence-final words while EEG was recorded from the scalp. When comparing two different sets of task instructions, the neural effects of cloze probability were enhanced when predictive processing was emphasized. In Experiment 2 (N = 252), participants read predictable and unpredictable sentence continuations in a self-paced reading task, and the overall validity of predictive cues was manipulated across groups using a separate set of filler sentences. There was a linear relationship between the benefits of a constraining sentence context and the global validity of predictive cues. Critically, no reading time benefits were observed as prediction validity approached zero. These results provide important constraints for theories of anticipatory language processing, while calling into question prior assumptions about the automaticity of lexical prediction.

The tests presented words with letters that varied in size and shape in Experiment 1 and words containing scrambled letters in Experiment 2. Results from Experiment 1 showed that the interference effect of size and shape on word naming accuracy and latency was robust for all readers. Likewise, results from Experiment 2 showed a broad interference effect of scrambled letters on word naming; however, scrambled letters appeared less disruptive to word naming among Chinese readers compared to their Korean and native English speaking counterparts. Taken together, Chinese speakers were less efficient in recognizing atypical words at the sublexical level, but more efficient at the lexical level.

Abstract = {This study examined contributions of lexical factors to native-speaking raters’ assessments of comprehensibility (ease of understanding) of second language (L2) speech. Extemporaneous oral narratives elicited from 40 French speakers of L2 English were transcribed and evaluated for comprehensibility by 10 raters. Subsequently, the samples were analyzed for 12 lexical variables targeting diverse domains of lexical usage (appropriateness, fluency, variation, sophistication, abstractness, and sense relations). For beginner-to-intermediate speakers, comprehensibility was related to basic uses of L2 vocabulary (fluent and accurate use of concrete words). For intermediate-to-advanced speakers, comprehensibility was linked to sophisticated uses of L2 lexis (morphologically accurate use of complex, less familiar, polysemous words). These findings, which highlight complex associations between lexical variables and L2 comprehensibility, suggest that improving comprehensibility requires attention to multiple lexical domains of L2 performance.

Abstract = {This research represents the first attempt to produce a working system for the automatic processing of texts of Bahasa Melayu 'Malay'. At the heart of the system is an integrated relational lexical database called MALEX, which draws on the experience of working on English and other languages, but which is specifically tailored to the conditions of Malay.

Abstract = {Textual data is at the forefront of information management problems today. One response has been the development of visualizations of text data. These visualizations, commonly based on simple attributes such as relative word frequency, have become increasingly popular tools. We extend this direction, presenting the first visualization of document content which combines word frequency with the human-created structure in lexical databases to create a visualization that also reflects semantic content. DocuBurst is a radial, space-filling layout of hyponymy (the IS-A relation), overlaid with occurrence counts of words in a document of interest to provide visual summaries at varying levels of granularity. Interactive document analysis is supported with geometric and semantic zoom, selectable focus on individual words, and linked access to source text.

Abstract = {Since the work of Taft and Forster (), a growing literature has examined how English compound words are recognized and organized in the mental lexicon. Much of this research has focused on whether compound words are decomposed during recognition by manipulating the word frequencies of their lexemes. However, many variables may impact morphological processing, including relational semantic variables such as semantic transparency, as well as additional form-related and semantic variables. In the present study, ratings were collected on 629 English compound words for six variables [familiarity, age of acquisition (AoA), semantic transparency, lexeme meaning dominance (LMD), imageability, and sensory experience ratings (SER)]. All of the compound words selected for this study are contained within the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., ), which made it possible to use a regression approach to examine the predictive power of these variables for lexical decision and word naming performa)},

Abstract = {Learning vocabulary and understanding texts present difficulty for language learners due to, among other things, the high degree of lexical ambiguity. By developing an intelligent tutoring system, this dissertation examines whether automatically providing enriched sense-specific information is effective for vocabulary learning and reading comprehension of second language learners. The system developed in this study contributes to an extended understanding of how NLP techniques can be applied more effectively in an educational environment. The system allows learners to upload texts and click on any content word in order to obtain sense-appropriate lexical information for unfamiliar or unknown words during reading. The system consists of three components: (1) the system manager controls the interaction among each learner, the NLP server, and the lexical database; (2) the NLP server converts a raw input text to a linguistically-analyzed text; (3) the lexical database is used to provide a sense-appropriate definition and example sentences of a word to the learner. To obtain the sense-appropriate information, the system first performs word sense disambiguation (WSD) on the input text. Pointing to appropriate examples tuned for language learners, however, is complicated by the fact that the database of examples is from one repository (COBUILD), while automatic WSD systems generally rely on senses from another (WordNet). The lexical database, then, is indexed by WordNet senses, each of which points to an appropriate corresponding COBUILD sense. The fact that every sense inventory has its own standards of sense distinction poses a serious problem in integrating these inventories into one. To redirect an input WordNet sense to a corresponding COBUILD sense, thus, a word sense alignment algorithm was developed, following a heuristic of favoring flatter alignment structures. With this system, an empirical study was conducted with 60 intermediate learners of English as a second language to examine whether this system can lead learners to improve their vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension. The findings show that learners demonstrated higher performance when receiving sense-specific information. Furthermore, the qualitative examination of the effect of automatic system errors show that, although learners showed learning regardless of the appropriateness of lexical information, they still showed relatively greater learning when given appropriate lexical information.

Abstract = {This study investigated how Cantonese lexical tone sensitivity contributed to English lexical stress sensitivity among Cantonese children who learned English as a second language (ESL). Five-hundred-and-sixteen second-to-third grade Cantonese ESL children were tested on their Cantonese lexical tone sensitivity, English lexical stress sensitivity, general auditory sensitivity, and working memory. Structural equation modeling revealed that Cantonese lexical tone sensitivity contributed to English lexical stress sensitivity both directly, and indirectly through the mediation of general auditory sensitivity, in which the direct pathway had a larger relative contribution to English lexical stress sensitivity than the indirect pathway. These results suggest that the tone-stress association might be accounted for by joint phonological and acoustic processes that underlie lexical tone and lexical stress perception.

Abstract = {We take a multidimensional perspective on the development of second language (L2) speaking ability and examine how changes in the underlying cognitive variables of linguistic knowledge and processing speed interact with complexity, fluency, and accuracy over the course of a 3-month Spanish study abroad session. Study abroad provides a unique learning context for evaluating changes in the underlying dimensions of L2 speaking because learners are fully immersed in the target language and have ample opportunity to implement, practice, and integrate newly gained skills. Participants were 39 native English speakers acquiring Spanish in Argentina. Results show that participants experienced significant gains across complexity, fluency, and accuracy. However, these gains were not evenly distributed across all dimensions or across all learners. Learners with higher levels of L2 linguistic knowledge and faster L2 processing speed prior to study abroad experienced greater gains in accuracy and syntactic and lexical complexity during study abroad.

Abstract = {This study investigated the phonological preparation unit when planning spoken words with native Chinese speakers who speak English as a Second Language (ESLs). In Experiment 1, native Chinese speakers named pictures in Chinese, and the names shared the same onset, same rhyme, or had nothing systematically in common. No onset effect was shown, suggesting that native Chinese speakers did not use onset as their preparation unit. There was a rhyme interference effect, probably due to lexical competition. In Experiment 2, the same task was conducted in English among Chinese ESLs and native English speakers. Native speakers showed onset facilitation whereas ESLs did not show such an effect until Block 3. ESLs’ phonological preparation unit is likely to be influenced by their native language but with repetition they are able to attend to sub-syllabic units. Both groups showed rhyme interference, possibly as a result of joint lexical and phonological competition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Second language (L2) learning outcomes may depend on the structure of the input and learners’ cognitive abilities. This study tested whether less predictable input might facilitate learning and generalization of L2 morphology while evaluating contributions of statistical learning ability, nonverbal intelligence, phonological short‐term memory, and verbal working memory. Over three sessions, 54 adults were exposed to a Russian case‐marking paradigm with a balanced or skewed item distribution in the input. Whereas statistical learning ability and nonverbal intelligence predicted learning of trained items, only nonverbal intelligence also predicted generalization of case‐marking inflections to new vocabulary. Neither measure of temporary storage capacity predicted learning. Balanced, less predictable input was associated with higher accuracy in generalization but only in the initial test session. These results suggest that individual differences in pattern extraction play a more sustained role in L2 acquisition than instructional manipulations that vary the predictability of lexical items in the input.

Abstract = {In this study we present a novel set of discrimination-based indicators of language processing derived from Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) theory. We compare the effectiveness of these new measures with classical lexical-distributional measures-in particular, frequency counts and form similarity measures-to predict lexical decision latencies when a complete morphological segmentation of masked primes is or is not possible. Data derive from a re-analysis of a large subset of decision latencies from the English Lexicon Project, as well as from the results of two new masked priming studies. Results demonstrate the superiority of discrimination-based predictors over lexical-distributional predictors alone, across both the simple and primed lexical decision tasks. Comparable priming after masked CORNER and CORNEA type primes, across two experiments, fails to support early obligatory segmentation into morphemes as predicted by the morpho-orthographic account of reading. Results fit well with NDL theory, which, in conformity with Word and Paradigm theory, rejects the morpheme as a relevant unit of analysis. Furthermore, results indicate that readers with greater spelling proficiency and larger vocabularies make better use of orthographic priors and handle lexical competition more efficiently.

Abstract = {Previous research has provided evidence for a speechreading advantage in congenitally deaf adults compared to hearing adults. A ‘perceptual compensation’ account of this finding proposes that prolonged early onset deafness leads to a greater reliance on visual, as opposed to auditory, information when perceiving speech which in turn results in superior visual speech perception skills in deaf adults. In the current study we tested whether previous demonstrations of a speechreading advantage for profoundly congenitally deaf adults with hearing aids, or no amplificiation, were also apparent in adults with the same deafness profile but who have experienced greater access to the auditory elements of speech via a cochlear implant (CI). We also tested the prediction that, in line with the perceptual compensation account, receiving a CI at a later age is associated with superior speechreading skills due to later implanted individuals having experienced greater dependence on visual speech information. We designed a speechreading task in which participants viewed silent videos of 123 single words spoken by a model and were required to indicate which word they thought had been said via a free text response. We compared congenitally deaf adults who had received CIs in childhood or adolescence (N = 15) with a comparison group of hearing adults (N = 15) matched on age and education level. The adults with CI showed significantly better scores on the speechreading task than the hearing comparison group. Furthermore, within the group of adults with CI, there was a significant positive correlation between age at implantation and speechreading performance; earlier implantation was associated with lower speechreading scores. These results are both consistent with the hypothesis of perceptual compensation in the domain of speech perception, indicating that more prolonged dependence on visual speech information in speech perception may lead to improvements in the perception of visual speech. In addition our study provides metrics of the ‘speechreadability’ of 123 words produced in British English: one derived from hearing adults (N = 61) and one from deaf adults with CI (N = 15). Evidence for the validity of these ‘speechreadability’ metrics come from correlations with visual lexical competition data. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Patients with lesions in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been shown to be impaired in lexical selection, especially when interference between semantically related alternatives is increased. To more deeply investigate which computational mechanisms may be impaired following left PFC damage due to stroke, a psychometric modelling approach is employed in which we assess the cognitive parameters of the patients from an evidence accumulation (sequential information sampling) modelling of their response data. We also compare the results to healthy speakers. Analysis of the cognitive parameters indicates an impairment of the PFC patients to appropriately adjust their decision threshold, in order to handle the increased item difficulty that is introduced by semantic interference. Also, the modelling contributes to other topics in psycholinguistic theory, in which specific effects are observed on the cognitive parameters according to item familiarization, and the opposing effects of priming (lower threshold) and semantic interference (lower drift) which are found to depend on repetition. These results are developed for the blocked-cyclic picture naming paradigm, in which pictures are presented within semantically homogeneous (HOM) or heterogeneous (HET) blocks, and are repeated several times per block. Overall, the results are in agreement with a role of the left PFC in adjusting the decision threshold for lexical selection in language production.

Abstract = {Background: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) is a therapeutic option for patients with essential tremor. Despite a generally low risk of side effects, declines in verbal fluency (VF) have previously been reported. Objectives: We aimed to specify effects of VIM-DBS on major cognitive operations needed for VF task performance, represented by clusters and switches. Clusters are word production spurts, thought to arise from automatic activation of associated information pertaining to a given lexical field. Switches are slow word-to-word transitions, presumed to indicate controlled operations for stepping from one lexical field to another. Patients & methods: Thirteen essential tremor patients with VIM-DBS performed verbal fluency tasks in their VIM-DBS ON and OFF conditions. Clusters and switches were formally defined by mathematical criteria. All results were compared to those of fifteen healthy control subjects, and significant OFF-ON-change scores were correlated to stimulation parameters. Results: Patients produced fewer words than healthy controls. DBS ON compared to DBS OFF aggravated this deficit by prolonging the intervals between words within clusters, whereas switches remained unaffected. This stimulation effect correlated with more anterior electrode positions. Conclusion: VIM-DBS seems to influence word output dynamics during verbal fluency tasks on the level of word clustering. This suggests a perturbation of automatic lexical co-activation by thalamic stimulation, particularly if delivered relatively anteriorly. The findings are discussed in the context of the hypothesized role of the thalamus in lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Deictic time words like 'yesterday' and 'tomorrow' pose a challenge to children not only because they are abstract, and label periods in time, but also because their denotations vary according to the time at which they are uttered: Monday’s 'tomorrow' is different than Thursday’s. Although children produce these words as early as age 2 or 3, they do not use them in adult-like ways for several subsequent years. Here, we explored whether children have partial but systematic meanings for these words during the long delay before adult-like usage. We asked 3- to 8-year-olds to represent these words on a bidirectional, left-to-right timeline that extended from the past (infancy) to the future (adulthood). This method allowed us to independently probe knowledge of these words’ deictic status (e.g., 'yesterday' is in the past), relative ordering (e.g., 'last week' was before 'yesterday'), and remoteness from the present (e.g., 'last week' was about 7 times longer ago than 'yesterday'). We found that adult-like knowledge of deictic status and order emerge in synchrony, between ages 4 and 6, but that knowledge of remoteness emerges later, after age 7. Our findings suggest that children’s early use of deictic time words is not random, but instead reflects the gradual construction of a structured lexical domain.

Abstract = {A visual search for targets is facilitated when the target objects are on a different depth plane than other masking objects cluttering the scene. The ability of observers to determine whether one of four letters presented stereoscopically at four symmetrically located positions on the fixation plane differed from the other three was assessed when the target letters were masked by other randomly positioned and oriented letters appearing on the same depth plane as the target letters, or in front, or behind it. Three additional control maskers, derived from the letter maskers, were also presented on the same three depth planes: (1) random-phase maskers (same spectral amplitude composition as the letter masker but with the phase spectrum randomized); (2) random-pixel maskers (the locations of the letter maskers’ pixel amplitudes were randomized); (3) letter-fragment maskers (the same letters as in the letter masker but broken up into fragments). Performance improved with target duration when the -target letter plane was in front of the letter-masker plane, but not when the target letters were on the same plane as the masker, or behind it. A comparison of the results for the four different kinds of maskers indicated that maskers consisting of recognizable objects (letters or letter fragments) interfere more with search and comparison judgments than do visual noise maskers having the same spatial frequency profile and contrast. In addition, performance was poorer for letter maskers than for letter-masker fragments, suggesting that the letter maskers interfered more with performance than the letter-fragment maskers because of the lexical activity they elicit.

Abstract = {While the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) is characterized by a predominant semantic memory impairment, episodic memory impairments are the clinical hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, AD patients also present with semantic deficits, which are more severe for semantically unique entities (e.g. a famous person) than for common concepts (e.g. a beaver). Previous studies in these patient populations have largely focused on famous-person naming. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate if these impairments also extend to other semantically unique entities such as famous places and famous logos. In this study, 13 AD patients, 9 svPPA patients, and 12 cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects (CTRL) were tested with a picture-naming test of non-unique entities (Boston Naming Test) and three experimental tests of semantically unique entities assessing naming of famous persons, places, and logos. Both clinical groups were overall more impaired at naming semantically unique entities than non-unique entities. Naming impairments in AD and svPPA extended to the other types of semantically unique entities, since a CTRL > AD > svPPA pattern was found on the performance of all naming tests. Naming famous places and famous persons appeared to be most impaired in svPPA, and both specific and general semantic knowledge for these entities were affected in these patients. Although AD patients were most significantly impaired on famous-person naming, only their specific semantic knowledge was impaired, while general knowledge was preserved. Post-hoc neuroimaging analyses also showed that famous-person naming impairments in AD correlated with atrophy in the temporo-parietal junction, a region functionally associated with lexical access. In line with previous studies, svPPA patients’ impairment in both naming and semantic knowledge suggest a more profound semantic impairment, while naming impairments in AD may arise to a greater extent from impaired lexical access, even though semantic impairment for specific knowledge is also present. These results highlight the critical importance of developing and using a variety of semantically-unique-entity naming tests in neuropsychological assessments of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, which may unveil different patterns of lexical-semantic deficits.

Abstract = {The literary genre of poetry is inherently related to the expression and elicitation of emotion via both content and form. To explore the nature of this affective impact at an extremely basic textual level, we collected ratings on eight different general affective meaning scales—valence, arousal, friendliness, sadness, spitefulness, poeticity, onomatopoeia, and liking—for 57 German poems ('die verteidigung der wölfe') which the contemporary author H. M. Enzensberger had labeled as either 'friendly,' 'sad,' or 'spiteful.' Following Jakobson’s (1960) view on the vivid interplay of hierarchical text levels, we used multiple regression analyses to explore the specific influences of affective features from three different text levels (sublexical, lexical, and inter-lexical) on the perceived general affective meaning of the poems using three types of predictors: (1) Lexical predictor variables capturing the mean valence and arousal potential of words; (2) Inter-lexical predictors quantifying peaks, ranges, and dynamic changes within the lexical affective content; (3) Sublexical measures of basic affective tone according to sound-meaning correspondences at the sublexical level (see Aryani et al., 2016). We find the lexical predictors to account for a major amount of up to 50% of the variance in affective ratings. Moreover, inter-lexical and sublexical predictors account for a large portion of additional variance in the perceived general affective meaning. Together, the affective properties of all used textual features account for 43–70% of the variance in the affective ratings and still for 23–48% of the variance in the more abstract aesthetic ratings. In sum, our approach represents a novel method that successfully relates a prominent part of variance in perceived general affective meaning in this corpus of German poems to quantitative estimates of affective properties of textual components at the sublexical, lexical, and inter-lexical level.

Abstract = {Classic accounts of lexical organization posit that humans are sensitive to environmental frequency, suggesting a mechanism for word learning based on repetition. However, a recent spate of evidence has revealed that it is not simply frequency but the diversity and distinctiveness of contexts in which a word occurs that drives lexical organization. This chapter provides an in-depth evaluation of new research on contextual diversity, integrating evidence from word recognition, semantic memory, episodic memory, and information retrieval. The aggregate evidence suggests an expectancy-congruency learning mechanism that updates lexical representations based on the fit between the current contents of memory and the information in the local environmental context. This learning mechanism produces a well-structured lexicon that is adapted to the demands of lexical retrieval and processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the generation of past-tense verbs in a case of a man with a semantic disorder and a marked anomia. He also produced frequent slips of the tongue in short-term memory tasks, involving sets of single words and short sentences. In our investigation, we used the standard Today-Yesterday task but, rather than using mixed lists of regular and irregular verbs, as are generally used, we blocked the regular and irregular verbs according to their phonological properties. We began by presenting an ordered series of blocked lists, but later developed a new technique in which we established one type of verb before mixing it with others. The results of our investigations revealed interactions between different types of verbs that we believe expose the phonological-morphological frames of each type of verb, and place them all within a dynamic lexical system.

Abstract = {Language comprehension engages a distributed network of frontotemporal, parietal, and sensorimotor regions, but it is still unclear how meaning of words and their semantic relationships are represented and processed within these regions and to which degrees lexico-semantic representations differ between regions and semantic types. We used fMRI and representational similarity analysis to relate word-elicited multivoxel patterns to semantic similarity between action and object words. In left inferior frontal (BA 44-45-47), left posterior middle temporal and left precentral cortex, the similarity of brain response patterns reflected semantic similarity among action-related verbs, as well as across lexical classes-between action verbs and tool-related nouns and, to a degree, between action verbs and food nouns, but not between action verbs and animal nouns. Instead, posterior inferior temporal cortex exhibited a reverse response pattern, which reflected the semantic similarity among object-related nouns, but not action-related words. These results show that semantic similarity is encoded by a range of cortical areas, including multimodal association (e.g., anterior inferior frontal, posterior middle temporal) and modality-preferential (premotor) cortex and that the representational geometries in these regions are partly dependent on semantic type, with semantic similarity among action-related words crossing lexical-semantic category boundaries.

Abstract = {Purpose: We used an eye-tracking technique to investigate whether English listeners use suprasegmental information about lexical stress to speed up the recognition of spoken words in English. Method: In a visual world paradigm, 24 young English listeners followed spoken instructions to choose 1 of 4 printed referents on a computer screen (e.g., 'Click on the word admiral'). Displays contained a critical pair of words (e.g., ˈadmiral–ˌadmiˈration) that were segmentally identical for their first 2 syllables but differed suprasegmentally in their 1st syllable: One word began with primary lexical stress, and the other began with secondary lexical stress. All words had phrase-level prominence. Listeners’ relative proportion of eye fixations on these words indicated their ability to differentiate them over time. Results: Before critical word pairs became segmentally distinguishable in their 3rd syllables, participants fixated target words more than their stress competitors, but only if targets had initial primary lexical stress. The degree to which stress competitors were fixated was independent of their stress pattern. Conclusions: Suprasegmental information about lexical stress modulates the time course of spoken-word recognition. Specifically, suprasegmental information on the primary-stressed syllable of words with phrase-level prominence helps in distinguishing the word from phonological competitors with secondary lexical stress.

Abstract = {WordNet, a large lexical database of English, was conceived as a model of human semantic organization. Evidence from timing experiments, association norms, and distributional properties of words supported a semantic network model in which words are interlinked via a small number of lexical and conceptual relations. Its large coverage and unique structure, which allows automatic systems to detect and quantify semantic relatedness among words, soon made WordNet an invaluable tool for natural language processing tasks. Information retrieval, document summarization, and machine translation crucially require word sense discrimination and disambiguation. Wordnets have been built in dozens of languages and for specific technical sublanguages, and the number of applications in research, language technology and pedagogy has grown. Although WordNet’s central focus has shifted from its psycholinguistic origins, its design, based on theories about the structure of the human mental lexicon, is validated as a sound approach to representing the meanings of words.

Abstract = {Monolingual children follow pointing over labeling when these are in conflict in object selection tasks. Specifically, when a speaker labels one object, but points at another object, monolinguals select the object pointed at. Here, we ask whether (i) bilingual children show the same behavior as monolinguals and (ii) relative language proficiency affects bilinguals’ conflict resolution. 35 monolingual and 32 bilingual two- to four-year-olds performed an experiment involving a conflict between pointing and labeling. The bilinguals were tested in Dutch and in English. The bilinguals had a stronger preference for pointing over labeling and selected both objects less often than the monolinguals. Point following was stronger in the bilinguals’ weaker language than in their stronger language. These results support earlier findings on bilinguals’ increased sensitivity to socio-pragmatic cues and weaker reliance on mutual exclusivity, and show that previously acquired language knowledge affects how children weigh socio-pragmatic and lexical cues.

Abstract = {In this dissertation, I addressed three questions regarding the impact of language processing on eye movements in reading: (1) What information from the sentence context do readers recruit prior to skipping? (2) Are words like 'the' unique with regard to skipping because they are so short? (3) Does postlexical integration strictly follow word identification? Throughout, I recruit the E-Z Reader 10 model (Reichle, Warren, & McConnell, 2009) for testable predictions. In Chapter 2, I demonstrate that the influence of the sentence context on skipping is limited to predictability, and not deeper semantic or syntactic processing. Readers skipped over invalid, contextually infelicitous parafoveal previews of 'the' more often than valid previews of three-letter words, even when the target words were predictable. In Chapter 3, I show that this effect generalizes to longer function words like 'that' and 'there', which highlights the role of parafoveal processing relative to oculomotor or contextual constraints (e.g., syntactic or semantic fit) in word skipping. Comparing Experiment 3.2 to Experiment 3.1, it is also evident that readers prefer to skip function words over content words, regardless of their length. The data presented in Chapters 2--3 pose a deeper question about the relationship between language processing and eye movement control that indicates a possible constraint on the architecture: Are word identification and postlexical integration isolated, separable processes? This issue is examined in Chapter 4 by jointly manipulating word frequency and plausibility. I demonstrate probabilistic evidence against an influence of plausibility on word skipping, and in favor of an additive relationship between frequency and plausibility (and against an interactive relationship), by computing Bayes factors. In summary, I paint a picture in which word skipping reflects a hedged bet that identification will ultimately be successful, and all postlexical processing (i.e., of syntax and semantics) follows lexical access.

Abstract = {Orofacial clefts are among the most common congenital defects in the United States, affecting roughly 1 in 600 births annually. A majority of these cases are considered to be 'isolated' clefts of the lip and/or palate (ICLP). However the term 'isolated' is somewhat of a misnomer, as functional deficits frequently accompany ICLP. One of the most problematic yet understudied of these deficits involves the high prevalence of reading disabilities in this population. It has been estimated that as high as 46% of children with ICLP will be diagnosed with a reading disability, particularly dyslexia. Despite this high prevalence and the well-established neurological basis of dyslexia, relatively little attention has been paid to the role that brain development plays in the reading problems in ICLP. Previous studies from our lab have demonstrated significant changes in brain structure in children with ICLP (that have importantly correlated with functional measures). However we have yet to combine both a structural and functional neuroimaging study with an in-depth analysis of reading dysfunction in this population. The current study examined boys with ICLP, age 8-12 (boys have a higher prevalence of ICLP and show more significant reading problems that girls with ICLP) compared to healthy control boys. Measures of cognitive functioning were obtained with an emphasis on reading and language skills. In addition MRI scans were obtained which included volumetric measures, diffusion-weighted measures (DWI; white matter), and connectivity measures (resting-state fMRI). Even after controlling for the effect of socioeconomic status, boys with ICLP showed significant decreases in reading and language skills (particularly reading fluency). Boys with ICLP did not show significant differences on phonological measures (the primary cause of dyslexia). In addition, phonological measures were not predictive of reading fluency, while object naming tasks were predictive of reading fluency in boys with ICLP. For white matter integrity, measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) were found to be increased in the right occipital lobe for boys with ICLP indicating more organized white matter in this region. This increase in right occipital FA was also predictive of better reading outcomes, particularly reading fluency. For more specific white matter tracts, only the fornix and the tapetum (both associated with the temporal lobes) showed a significant difference with a decrease in FA for boys with ICLP. The decrease in FA in the tapetum was also predictive of better reading outcomes in ICLP. When looking at resting-state networks, boys with ICLP showed an increase in connectivity within posterior and subcortical regions when compared to healthy control boys, indicating stronger network connections within the posterior language regions of the brain. Taken together, these results point to differences in both structural and functional connectivity in the brains boys with ICLP. Furthermore, this pattern is different than that found in children with developmental dyslexia as there appears to be no disruption of the posterior reading systems. Cognitive measures also indicate normal phonological awareness in this group, further distinguishing them from dyslexic children. Boys with ICLP instead may be over-relying on these posterior, more visually oriented reading systems as a compensatory mechanism to overcome problems with the development of the typical 'lexical route' of reading.

Abstract = {Music can be a powerful mnemonic device, as shown by a body of literature demonstrating that listening to text sung to a familiar melody results in better memory for the words compared to conditions where they are spoken. Furthermore, patients with a range of memory impairments appear to be able to form new declarative memories when they are encoded in the form of lyrics in a song, while unable to remember similar materials after hearing them in the spoken modality. Whether music facilitates the acquisition of completely new information, such as new vocabulary, remains unknown. Here we report three experiments in which adult participants learned novel words in the spoken or sung modality. While we found no benefit of musical presentation on free recall or recognition memory of novel words, novel words learned in the sung modality were more strongly integrated in the mental lexicon compared to words learned in the spoken modality. This advantage for the sung words was only present when the training melody was familiar. The impact of musical presentation on learning therefore appears to extend beyond episodic memory and can be reflected in the emergence and properties of new lexical representations.

Abstract = {This study introduces a method ideally suited for investigating toddlers’ ability to detect mispronunciations in lexical representations: pupillometry. Previous research has established that the magnitude of pupil dilation reflects differing levels of cognitive effort. Building on those findings, we use pupil dilation to study the level of detail encoded in lexical representations with 30-month-old children whose lexicons allow for a featurally balanced stimulus set. In each trial, we present a picture followed by a corresponding auditory label. By systematically manipulating the number of feature changes in the onset of the label (e.g., baby ∼ daby∼ faby ∼ shaby), we tested whether featural distance predicts the degree of pupil dilation. Our findings support the existence of a relationship between featural distance and pupil dilation. First, mispronounced words are associated with a larger degree of dilation than correct forms. Second, words that deviate more from the correct form are related to a larger dilation than words that deviate less. This pattern indicates that toddlers are sensitive to the degree of mispronunciation, and as such it corroborates previous work that found word recognition modulated by sub-segmental detail and by the degree of mismatch. Thus, we establish that pupillometry provides a viable alternative to paradigms that require overt behavioral response in increasing our understanding of the development of lexical representations.

In Experiment 1 target nouns and verbs were produced in presence of semantically unrelated distractors that could also be nouns and verbs. Participants were slower when the distractor was of the same grammatical category of the target. To rule out the semantic hypothesis that the effects were due to objects versus actions semantic dichotomy rather than to grammatical class, Experiment 2 was conducted. Participants named target verbs in presence of unrelated action nouns and verbs. The results evidenced a grammatical category effect. Finally, in Experiments 3 and 4, morphologically not derived materials were used to verify the role of morphological information. The results evidenced a syntactic effect independent from morphology. Taken together the results supported the hypothesis that grammatical class information plays a crucial role in lexical production. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The current study investigated the roles of grammaticality and executive control on bilingual language selection by examining production speed and failures of language control, or intrusion errors (e.g., saying el instead of the), in young and aging bilinguals. Production of mixed-language connected speech was elicited by asking Spanish–English bilinguals to read aloud paragraphs that had mostly grammatical (conforming to naturally occurring constraints) or mostly ungrammatical (haphazard mixing) language switches, and low or high switching rate. Mixed-language speech was slower and less accurate when switch-rate was high, but especially (for speed) or only (for intrusion errors) if switches were also ungrammatical. Executive function ability (measured with a variety of tasks in young bilinguals in Experiment 1, and aging bilinguals in Experiment 2), slowed production and increased intrusion rate in a generalized fashion, but with little or no interaction with grammaticality. Aging effects appeared to reflect reduced monitoring ability (evidenced by a lower rate of self-corrected intrusions). These results demonstrate robust effects of grammatical encoding on language selection, and imply that executive control influences bilingual language production only after sentence planning and lexical selection.

Abstract = {We used a display change detection paradigm (Slattery, Angele, & Rayner Human Perception and Performance, 37, 1924–1938 2011) to investigate whether display change detection uses orthographic regularity and whether detection is affected by the processing difficulty of the word preceding the boundary that triggers the display change. Subjects were significantly more sensitive to display changes when the change was from a nonwordlike preview than when the change was from a wordlike preview, but the preview benefit effect on the target word was not affected by whether the preview was wordlike or nonwordlike. Additionally, we did not find any influence of preboundary word frequency on display change detection performance. Our results suggest that display change detection and lexical processing do not use the same cognitive mechanisms. We propose that parafoveal processing takes place in two stages: an early, orthography-based, preattentional stage, and a late, attention-dependent lexical access stage.

Abstract = {Automatic syllabification of words is challenging, not least because the syllable is not easy to define precisely. Consequently, no accepted standard algorithm for automatic syllabification exists. There are two broad approaches: rule-based and data-driven. The rule-based method effectively embodies some theoretical position regarding the syllable, whereas the data driven paradigm tries to infer "new" syllabifications from examples assumed to be correctly syllabified already. This article compares the performance of several variants of the two basic approaches. Given the problems of definition, it is difficult to determine a correct syllabification in all cases and so to establish the quality of the "gold standard" corpus used either to evaluate quantitatively the output of an automatic algorithm or as the example-set on which data-driven methods crucially depend. Thus, we look for consensus in the entries in multiple lexical databases of pre-syllabified words. In this work, we have u)},

Abstract = {Purpose: Five experiments probed auditory-visual (AV) understanding of sentences by users of cochlear implants (CIs). Method: Sentence material was presented in auditory (A), visual (V), and AV test conditions to listeners with normal hearing and CI users. Results: (a) Most CI users report that most of the time, they have access to both A and V information when listening to speech. (b) CI users did not achieve better scores on a task of speechreading than did listeners with normal hearing. (c) Sentences that are easy to speechread provided 12 percentage points more gain to speech understanding than did sentences that were difficult. (d) Ease of speechreading for sentences is related to phrase familiarity. (e) Users of bimodal CIs benefit from low-frequency acoustic hearing even when V cues are available, and a second CI adds to the benefit of a single CI when V cues are available. (f) V information facilitates lexical segmentation by improving the recognition of the number of syllables produced and the relative strength of these syllables. Conclusions: Our data are consistent with the view that V information improves CI users’ ability to identify syllables in the acoustic stream and to recognize their relative juxtaposed strengths. Enhanced syllable resolution allows better identification of word onsets, which, when combined with place-of-articulation information from visible consonants, improves lexical access.

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of persons with aphasia (PWA) to resolve different types of ambiguous words (homophones, metaphors, and metonyms) in discourse contexts. Method: Six PWA and 10 controls listened to short discourses that biased either the dominant (more frequent) or subordinate (less frequent) version of an ambiguous word as well as nonsense (filler) discourses. Participants then indicated whether or not the final sentence, which contained the ambiguity, made sense in the discourse. Data for both accuracy and reaction time were collected. Results: There was no significant Group × Word Type × Frequency interaction in the reaction time data. In the accuracy analysis, there was a significant Group × Frequency × Word Type interaction, which appeared to be driven by the PWA’s relative accuracy with subordinate homophones and relative inaccuracy with subordinate metaphors. Conclusions: These results suggest that PWA were able to use discourse contexts to resolve subordinate versions of literal ambiguous words but have difficulty resolving metaphoric ambiguous words. Further investigations should be done to clarify how much context PWA require to successfully resolve lexical ambiguities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We investigated whether the effects of valence and arousal on emotional word processing are modulated by concreteness using event-related potentials (ERPs). The stimuli included concrete words (Experiment 1) and abstract words (Experiment 2) that were organized in an orthogonal design, with valence (positive and negative) and arousal (low and high) as factors in a lexical decision task. In Experiment 1, the impact of emotion on the effects of concrete words mainly resulted from the contribution of valence. Positive concrete words were processed more quickly than negative words and elicited a reduction of N400 (300–410 ms) and enhancement of late positive complex (LPC; 450–750 ms), whereas no differences in response times or ERPs were found between high and low levels of arousal. In Experiment 2, the interaction between valence and arousal influenced the impact of emotion on the effects of abstract words. Low-arousal positive words were associated with shorter response times and a reduction of LPC amplitudes compared with high-arousal positive words. Low-arousal negative words were processed more slowly and elicited a reduction of N170 (140–200 ms) compared with high-arousal negative words. The present study indicates that word concreteness modulates the contributions of valence and arousal to the effects of emotion, and this modulation occurs during the early perceptual processing stage (N170) and late elaborate processing stage (LPC) for emotional words and at the end of all cognitive processes (i.e., reflected by response times). These findings support an embodied theory of semantic representation and help clarify prior inconsistent findings regarding the ways in which valance and arousal influence different stages of word processing, at least in a lexical decision task.

Abstract = {Several databases of written language exist in Spanish that manage important information on the lexical and sublexical characteristics of words. However, there is no database with information on the productivity and frequency of use of derivational suffixes: sublexical units with an essential role in the formation of orthographic representations and lexical access. This work examines these two measures, known as type and token frequencies, for a series of 50 derivational suffixes and their corresponding orthographic endings. Derivational suffixes are differentiated from orthographic endings by eliminating pseudoaffixed words from the list of orthographic endings (cerveza [beer] is a simple word despite its ending in -eza). We provide separate data for child and adult populations, using two databases commonly accessed by psycholinguists conducting research in Spanish. We describe the filtering process used to obtain descriptive data that will provide information for future research on token and type frequencies of morphemes. This database is an important development for researchers focusing on the role of morphology in lexical acquisition and access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

That is, when participants in interaction confront apparent troubles of meaning, what do those troubles consist in? What is the missing something that leaves participants in interaction feeling as though they do not understand what another means?

Abstract = {The ability to efficiently process presuppositions, which contain information that the speaker believes to be in the background to the conversation, is essential for effective communication. To get a deeper understanding of the nature and the time-course of temporal presupposition processing, we examined event-related potential evoked by the word again in two types of sentence contexts. The word again was presented in contexts that supported a presupposition (e.g. Jake had tipped a maid at the hotel once before. Today he tipped a maid at the hotel again … ) or violated it (e.g. Jake had never tipped a maid at the hotel before. Today he tipped a maid at the hotel again … ). The presupposition violation was associated with increased amplitudes of the P3b/P600 but not the N400 component. We argue for the centrality of the P3b/P600 component for presupposition processing. These findings demonstrate rapid integration of lexical presuppositions with contextual knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the effect of psycholinguistic variables on measures of response latency and mean interkeystroke interval in a typewritten picture naming task, with the aim to outline the functional organization of the stages of cognitive processing and response execution associated with typewritten word production. Onset latencies were modulated by lexical and semantic variables traditionally linked to lexical retrieval, such as word frequency, age of acquisition, and naming agreement. Orthographic variables, both at the lexical and sublexical level, appear to influence just within-word interkeystroke intervals, suggesting that orthographic information may play a relevant role in controlling actual response execution. Lexical-semantic variables also influenced speed of execution. This points towards cascaded flow of activation between stages of lexical access and response execution.

A number of syntagmatic (semantic link, different word class) and paradigmatic associations (semantic link, same word class) were calculated. Arabic and Swedish scores were compared with a conceptual score (total number of concepts from both languages). For BLI, the paradigmatic conceptual score was significantly higher than single language scores, confirming the distribution of lexical knowledge across languages. The BLI group had significantly higher conceptual paradigmatic scores than the MLI group. Conceptual scoring may reduce the over-identification of language impairment (LI) and underestimation of lexical knowledge in bilingual populations.

Abstract = {Language switching is common in bilingual processing, and it has been repeatedly shown to induce processing costs. However, only a handful of studies have examined such costs at the sentence level, with a limited few among them having incorporated factors extensively studied in monolingual sentence processing, such as semantic expectedness. Using the event related potentials (ERP) technique, this study aimed at exploring whether switching costs were modulated by (1) switching directions, when switching happens between languages of different dominance, and by (2) semantic expectedness, as indicated by cloze probability. Twenty-two Mandarin-Taiwanese early bilinguals, with Mandarin being their dominant and Taiwanese their non-dominant language, participated in the study. They were instructed to listen to the stimuli attentively and to perform a word memory recognition task in 20% of the trials. The results showed that switching induced an LPC effect, suggesting that switched elements were harder to be integrated. More importantly, switching from the dominant to the non-dominant language demanded extra effort than switching in the other direction, as reflected by the PMN (detection of an unexpected sound), the N400 (indication of lexical access difficulty) and the frontal negativity (inhibition of the pre-activated representations), revealing that the dominant language provides better prediction of the upcoming word. Also, cloze probability interacted with switching, but only at an early stage, suggesting that semantic expectedness did not enduringly modulate the switching cost. Our results generally supported predictions from the Bilingual Interactive Activation Plus model (BIA+ model, Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002), showing that language use and sentence context can affect lexical processing in bilinguals.

Articulatory suppression conditions were manipulated to determine if participants would use a speech- or sign-based code to rehearse lists of signed items. Results from all 3 experiments showed that oral suppression significantly reduced spans while manual suppression had no effect, revealing that participants were using speech-based rehearsal to retain lists of signed items in short-term memory. In addition, sub-vocal rehearsal using Chinese facilitated higher digit spans than English even though stimuli were perceived and recalled using signs. This difference was not found for lexical sign spans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Much has been said about children’s strategies for mapping elements of meaning to words in toddlerhood. However, children continue to refine word meanings and patterns of word use into middle childhood and beyond, even for common words appearing in early vocabulary. We address where children past toddlerhood diverge from adults and where they more closely approximate them, and why. In two studies, we examined naming of locomotion (walking, running, hopping, etc.) by children aged four to nine and compared their patterns of word use to adult patterns. We evaluated whether the children are sensitive to the biomechanical discontinuity between pendulum-type and impact-and-recoil-type actions that constrains adult word use.

Abstract = {The division of labor hypothesis proposed by Nespor, Peña, and Mehler (2003) postulates that consonants are more important than vowels in lexical processing (when learning and recognizing words). This consonant bias (C-bias) is supported by many adult and toddler studies. However, some cross-linguistic variation has been found in toddlerhood, and various hypotheses have been proposed to account for the origin of the consonant bias, which make distinct predictions regarding its developmental trajectory during the first year of life. The present study evaluated these hypotheses by investigating the consonant bias in young French-learning infants, a language in which a consistent consonant bias is reported from 11months of age onward. Accordingly, in a series of word form segmentation experiments building on the fact that both 6- and 8-month-old French-learning infants can segment monosyllabic words, we investigated the relative impact of consonant and vowel mispronunciations on the recognition of segmented word forms at these two ages. Infants were familiarized with passages containing monosyllabic target words and then tested in different conditions all including consonant and/or vowel mispronunciations of the target words. Overall, our findings reveal a consonant bias at 8months, but an opposite vowel bias at 6months. These findings first establish that the consonant bias emerges between 6 and 8months of age in French-learning infants. Second, we discuss the factors that might explain such a developmental trajectory, highlighting the possible roles of pre-lexical and phonological acquisition.

Abstract = {When children hear a novel word in a context presenting a novel object and a familiar one, they usually assume that the novel word refers to the novel object. In a series of experiments, we tested whether this behavior would be found when 2-year-olds interpreted novel words that differed phonologically from familiar words in only 1 sound, either a vowel or consonant. Under these conditions children almost always chose the familiar object, though examination of eye movements showed that children did detect the tested phonological distinctions. Thus, children discounted perceptible phonological variations when doing so permitted a resolution of the speaker’s meaning without postulating a new word. Children with larger vocabularies made novel-word interpretations more often than children with smaller vocabularies did. The results suggest that although young children do interpret speech in terms of a learned phonological system, this does not mean that children assume that phonological distinctions imply lexical distinctions.

Abstract = {A word learning paradigm was used to teach children novel words that varied in phonotactic probability and neighborhood density. The effects of frequency and density on speech production were examined when phonetic forms were nonreferential (i.e., when no referent was attached) and when phonetic forms were referential (i.e., when a referent was attached through fast mapping). Two methods of analysis were included: kinematic variability of speech movement patterning and measures of segmental accuracy. Results showed that phonotactic frequency influenced the stability of movement patterning whereas neighborhood density influenced phoneme accuracy. Motor learning was observed in both nonreferential and referential novel words. Forms with low phonotactic probability and low neighborhood density showed a word learning effect when a referent was assigned during fast mapping. These results elaborate on and specify the nature of interactivity observed across lexical, phonological, and articulatory domains. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Acquiring the correct meanings of words expressing quantities (seven, most) and qualities (red, spotty) present a challenge to learners. Understanding how children succeed at this requires understanding, not only of what kinds of data are available to them, but also the biases and expectations they bring to the learning task. The results of our word-learning task with 4-year-olds indicate that a 'syntactic bootstrapping' hypothesis correctly predicts a bias toward quantity-based interpretations when a novel word appears in the syntactic position of a determiner but also leaves open the explanation of a bias towards quality-based interpretations when the same word is presented in the syntactic position of an adjective. We develop four computational models that differentially encode how lexical, conceptual, and perceptual factors could generate the latter bias. Simulation results suggest it results from a combination of lexical bias and perceptual encoding. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Past research on lexical-gustatory synesthesia (people who associate words with tastes) has shown that linguistic factors underlie the inducer (word)–concurrent (taste) mappings in these individuals. The developmental cognitive model envisioned by Simner and Haywood (2009), and an extension of it proposed in this paper can be used to understand these linguistic associations. The first aim of the current case study was to test these models by examining the linguistic factors associated with this type of synesthesia. The influence of lexical-gustatory synesthesia on memory was investigated using a paired-associate learning task. Further, the present case study also examined if word-pairs with same or similar tastes and word-pairs with dissimilar tastes enhanced learning relative to word pairs that had no tastes. As predicted, the findings revealed possible phonological, phonological–lexical, and lexical–semantic factors linking the inducer–concurrent pairings. These findings are in line with the developmental cognitive models of LG synesthesia. There were no effects of synesthesia on memory as demonstrated by the lack of any significant difference between the synesthete and non-synesthete controls on a paired-associate learning task. Moreover, no significant differences emerged between the 'no taste' and 'taste' conditions (although she performed slightly better on the 'no taste' condition). Interestingly, a metamemory task (judgment-of-learning) revealed the opposite. That is, the synesthete predicted that her learning would be better in the 'taste' condition when compared to the 'no taste' condition. This indicates that the word-pairs, which produced tastes, could have created a 'foresight bias'. This is attributed to the unidirectional nature of this individual’s LG synesthesia. This finding should, however, be treated with caution because it is a preliminary finding based on a single subject and needs to be corroborated with future studies on other lexical-gustatory synesthetes.

Abstract = {The representational format of speech units in long-term memory is a topic of debate. We present novel event-related brain potential evidence from the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) paradigm that is compatible with abstract, non-redundant feature-based models like the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL). First, we show that the fricatives /s/ and /f/ display an asymmetric pattern of MMN responses, which is predicted if /f/ has a fully specified place of articulation ([LABAIAL]) but /s/ does not ([CONRONAL], which is lexically underspecified). Second, we show that when /s/ and /h/ are contrasted, no such asymmetric MMN pattern occurs. The lack of asymmetry suggests both that (i) oral and laryngeal articulators are represented distinctly and that (ii) /h/ has no oral place of articulation in long-term memory. The lack of asymmetry between /s/ and /h/ is also in-line with traditional feature-geometric models of lexical representations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The current paper examined whether lexical access might (ever) cross talker boundaries. In four cross-modal priming experiments, listeners made visual lexical decisions after hearing an auditory word or word pair. On some trials, the auditory signal was produced by a single talker; on other trials, a talker gender change occurred in the middle of the auditory sequence. Participants demonstrated priming for items crossing both word boundaries and talker changes: after hearing a male talker say my and a female talker say great, participants showed a speeded response to 'geese' (related to 'migrate'). Priming was based on the combination of syllables across talkers, not driven simply by the first word. Findings suggest that acoustic cues indicating multiple talkers are insufficient to disrupt lexical access, and activation of lexical representations is not limited to those occurring within a single-talker stream. This provides support for models that do not involve explicit pre-lexical segmentation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The partial awareness hypothesis is a theoretical proposal that recently provided a reconciling solution to graded and dichotomous accounts of consciousness. It suggests that we can become conscious of distinct properties of an object independently, ranging from low-level features to complex forms of representation. We investigated this hypothesis using classic visual word masking adapted to a near-threshold paradigm. The masking intensity was adjusted to the individual perception threshold, at which individual alphabetical letters, but not words, could be perceived in approximately half of the trials. We confined perception to a pre-lexical stage of word processing that corresponded to a clear condition of partial awareness. At this level of representation, the stimulus properties began to emerge within consciousness, yet they did not escalate to full stimulus awareness. In other words, participants were able to perceive individual letters, while remaining unaware of the whole letter strings presented. Cortical activity measured with MEG was compared between physically identical trials that differed in perception (perceived, not perceived). We found that compared to no awareness, partial awareness of words was characterized by suppression of oscillatory alpha power in left temporal and parietal cortices. The analysis of functional connectivity with seeds based on the power effect in these two regions revealed sparse connections for the parietal seed, and strong connections between the temporal seed and other regions of the language network. We suggest that the engagement of language regions indexed by alpha power suppression is responsible for establishing and maintaining conscious representations of individual pre-lexical units.

Abstract = {Early language acquisition is potentially complicated by the presence of many sources of variability in the speech signal. A frequent example of variability is phonological alternations, which can lead to context-driven changes in the realization of a word. The aim of the current study was to investigate effects of a highly frequent yet scarcely researched type of suprasegmental phonological alternation—tone Sandhi—on early spoken word recognition. The tone Sandhi rule investigated herein involves a tone change of the first syllable in a disyllabic unit. In accordance with third tone Sandhi, when two dipping tone syllables are juxtaposed in connected speech, the first syllable is dissimilated to a high rising tone. For example, ‘flour mill’ (unaltered pre-Sandhi form [fən(214) tşhaŋ(214)]) undergoes tonal alternation resulting in the altered post-Sandhi form [fən(35) tşhaŋ(214)]. In the current study, preschoolers’ sensitivity to the effects of tone Sandhi when processing familiar words was investigated via a preferential looking paradigm. Words varied in their phonological form: one set of words was labeled with a phonological alternation due to Sandhi (Post Sandhi), one set of words was labeled with an unaltered Sandhi form (Pre Sandhi), one set consisted of non Sandhi words (Correct Pronunciation, and one set were labeled with a tonal alternation not associated with Sandhi rules (Mispronunciation). Post-Sandhi forms and correct pronunciations were associated with visual referents with comparable strength, with only a subtle processing cost observed for post-Sandhi forms in the time course of lexical selection. Likewise, pre-Sandhi forms and true mispronunciations were rejected as labels for visual references with comparable strength, with only subtle differences observed in the time course of lexical selection. Findings are discussed in terms of their impact on prevailing theories of lexical representation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studies of working memory for musical tone are seldom reported, and verbal working memory experiments have not focused on the tonal aspects of a language such as Mandarin Chinese. We examined the relationships among musical experience, tonal language processing, and working memory in adult reading of musical notation and Mandarin Chinese. We hypothesized that 30 adults with formal musical training trained in translating print to sound in sight-reading would have an advantage over 30 adults without formal musical training in converting print to lexical tone in reading a tonal language. Using n-back reading tasks, we found that the adults with formal musical training were better able to extract lexical tone information from print than the adults without formal musical training, or to maintain it in working memory. Even in a Mandarin homophone task, requiring phonological judgments of print, adults with formal musical training demonstrated superior performance. We discuss possible reasons why musical experience facilitates processing of phonology and lexical tone in reading tasks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The first step of this analysis is to isolate the recursive adjectival and nominal formations, for which the lexical database of Old English Nerthus (www.nerthusproject.com) is used. Out of a total of nearly 7,500 affixed nouns and adjectives, there are 388 recursive formations. The main conclusion of this article is that recursivity in the formation of adjectives and nouns crucially depends on the noun as source category and the adjective as path category. As a general rule, the derivation proceeds as follows: noun > adjective > noun / adjective.

First, a regression analysis of data taken from a large lexical database of Limburgish dialects in Belgium and The Netherlands is conducted to illustrate that concept characteristics such as concept salience, concept vagueness and negative affect contribute to the lexical heterogeneity in the dialect data. Next, it is shown that the relationship between concept characteristics and lexical heterogeneity influences the results of conventional lexical dialectometric measurements. Finally, a dialectometric procedure is proposed which downplays this undesired influence, thus making it possible to obtain a clearer picture of the ‘truly’ regional variation. More specifically, a lexical dialectometric method is proposed in which concept characteristics form the basis of a weighting schema that determines to which extent concept specific dissimilarities can contr)},

The Finnish wordnet, FinnWordNet (FiWN), was created by translating the more than 200,000 word senses in the English Princeton WordNet (PWN) 3.0 in 100 days. To ensure quality, they were translated by professional translators. The direct translation approach was based on the assumption that most synsets in PWN represent language-independent real-world concepts. Thus also the semantic relations between synsets were assumed mostly language-independent, so the structure of PWN could be reused as well. This approach allowed the creation of an extensive Finnish wordnet directly aligned with PWN and also provided us with a translation relation and thus a bilingual wordnet usable as a dictionary.

The article examines antisemitic discourse in English football and in doing so, explains the different uses and meanings of ‘Yid’ in the vernacular culture of fans. While many conceive of ‘Yid’ as an ethnic epithet, fans of Tottenham Hotspur—Gentiles and Jews—have appropriated and embraced the term, using it to deflect the antisemitic abuse they are targeted with due to their ‘Jewish identity’. The study maps the contested uses of ‘Yid’ on a continuum to explain and demarcate between the nuanced forms of antisemitism in football. It makes central the cultural context in which ‘Yid’ is used, together with the intent underpinning its use, since epithets and slurs are not simply determined by their lexical form.

Abstract = {Purpose: Nonnative listeners have difficulty recognizing English words due to underdeveloped acoustic–phonetic and/or lexical skills. The present study used Boothroyd and Nittrouer’s (1988) j factor to tease apart these two components of word recognition. Method: Participants included 15 native English and 29 native Russian listeners. Fourteen and 15 of the Russian listeners reported English (ED) and Russian (RD) to be their dominant language, respectively. Listeners were presented 119 consonant–vowel–consonant real and nonsense words in speech-spectrum noise at +6 dB SNR. Responses were scored for word and phoneme recognition, the logarithmic quotient of which yielded j. Results: Word and phoneme recognition was comparable between native and ED listeners but poorer in RD listeners. Analysis of j indicated less effective use of lexical information in RD than in native and ED listeners. Lexical processing was strongly correlated with the length of residence in the United States. Conclusions: Language background is important for nonnative word recognition. Lexical skills can be regarded as nativelike in ED nonnative listeners. Compromised word recognition in ED listeners is unlikely a result of poor lexical processing. Performance should be interpreted with caution for listeners dominant in their first language, whose word recognition is affected by both lexical and acoustic–phonetic factors.

Abstract = {This study examines the perception and processing of the Catalan /e/–/ɛ/ and /o/–/ɔ/ vowel contrasts by 60 Spanish–Catalan bilinguals in Majorca (Spain). Results from binary forced-choice identification, AX discrimination, and lexical decision tasks show that even though these early and highly proficient bilinguals demonstrate a high accuracy in perceptual identification and discrimination tasks, they have difficulties distinguishing between words and nonwords in a lexical decision task. Spanish dominants also exhibited higher error rates than Catalan dominants in the lexical decision task. These findings provide evidence that making explicit judgments regarding whether a certain sound belongs to a phonemic category (i.e., as accomplished via identification and discrimination tasks) does not entail that listeners have an appropriate representation at the lexical level.

Abstract = {This paper investigates Jordanian editorial cartoons drawn by the eminent Jordanian cartoonist Emad Hajjaj. It aims at analyzing Hajjaj's cartoons within a multimodal approach to context with a consideration of three types of sub-contexts essential to the understanding of the cartoon's message: (1) macro-context, (2) microcontext and (3) dynamic context. The data is based on a corpus of 300 cartoons analyzed within a general linguistic framework inspired by Van Dijk's (2008) theory of context models. Two main results emerge: First, Hajjaj's cartoons take into full consideration the verbal, visual, and socio-cultural modes to create visually stimulating images and socioculturally relevant issues. Second, the study presents an inventory of Hajjaj's lexical devices and innovative techniques. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Aim: This cross‐sectional study focused on the effect of very preterm (VPT) birth on language development by analysing phonological, lexical, grammatical, and pragmatic skills and assessing the role of cognitive and memory skills. Method: Sixty children (29 males, 31 females) born VPT (< 32 wks) aged 5 years were compared with 60 children with typical development. The linguistic assessment was performed by administering a battery of Italian tests for the evaluation of language; cognitive and memory skills were assessed by Raven's coloured progressive matrices and digit span subtest (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children [WISC‐III]). Results: Children born VPT showed delays in lexical (comprehension: z‐score difference −1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] −1.60 to −0.77; naming: −0.88; 95% CI −1.19 to −0.58) and pragmatic skills (comprehension: −0.76; 95% CI −1.02 to −0.49; narrative production: −0.47; 95% CI −0.72 to −0.23). Delays in phonology and grammar were less diffuse, involving productive skills (−1.09; 95% CI −1.64 to −0.54; −0.48; 95% CI −0.85 to −0.12, respectively), and were dependent by cognitive and memory skills. Lexical delays were more specific. Interpretation: The linguistic profile of children born preterm is characterized by some abilities more impaired than others. This highlights the need of a linguistic assessment at the end of preschool age in order to plan a focused intervention aimed at improving lexical and pragmatic skills.

Abstract = {Bilingualism has been associated with slower lexical processing in both languages, but it remains unclear to what extent this effect may be modulated by language use. We compared older English monolinguals with two groups of older bilinguals on lexical processing tasks. Both acquired English and Gaelic during childhood, but while active bilinguals continued to use both languages, inactive bilinguals mostly used English. All three groups showed similar accuracy in English. However, in reaction times, active but not inactive bilinguals were slower than monolinguals. We conclude that language use can modulate effects of bilingualism on lexical tasks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {An examination of how the word recognition system is able to process handwritten words is fundamental to formulate a comprehensive model of visual word recognition. Previous research has revealed that the magnitude of lexical effects (e.g., the word-frequency effect) is greater with handwritten words than with printed words. In the present lexical decision experiments, we examined whether the quality of handwritten words moderates the recruitment of top-down feedback, as reflected in word-frequency effects. Results showed a reading cost for difficult-to-read and easy-to-read handwritten words relative to printed words. But the critical finding was that difficult-to-read handwritten words, but not easy-to-read handwritten words, showed a greater word-frequency effect than printed words. Therefore, the inherent physical variability of handwritten words does not necessarily boost the magnitude of lexical effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Consonants have been proposed to carry more of the weight of lexical processing than vowels. This consonant bias has consistently been found in adults and has been proposed to facilitate early language acquisition. We explore the origins of this bias over the course of development and in infants learning different languages. Although the consonant bias was originally thought to be present at birth, evidence suggests that it arises from the early stages of phonological and (pre-)lexical acquisition. We discuss two theories that account for the acquisition of the consonant bias: the lexical and acoustic-phonetic hypotheses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by D.W. Gow and B. B. Olsona (see record [rid]2016-35709-001[/rid]). Gow and Olson take on one of the most contentious issues in the speech perception field: Is the architecture of the speech perception system entirely bottom-up, or do higher level representations affect the operation of lower level ones? In the literature, this argument has pitted 'autonomous' models against 'interactive' ones. As Gow and Olson noted, one of the objections to interactive models is philosophical rather than empirical: If the system already has enough information to activate the correct word, what purpose is there to go back and shift the phonetic code? This argument also applies to increasingly popular 'forward models' that seem to be modern variants of 'analysis by synthesis' as in these models the system is assumed to generate a kind of hypothesis and then to match that hypothesis against the input signal. Gow and Olson recognise that the dissociation that Connine posits for lexical versus sentential context is at odds with their suggestion that their sentential effect is essentially just a mediated (true interactive) lexical effect.

Abstract = {In listening to speech, people have been shown to apply several types of adjustment to their phonemic categories that take into account variations in the prevailing linguistic environment. These adjustments include selective adaptation, lexically driven recalibration, and audiovisually determined recalibration. Prior studies have used dual task procedures to test whether these adjustments are automatic or if they require attention, and all of these tests have supported automaticity. The current study instead uses a method of targeted distraction to demonstrate that lexical recalibration does in fact require attention. Building on this finding, the targeted distraction method is used to measure the period of time during which the lexical percept remains malleable. The results support a processing window of approximately one second, consistent with the results of a small number of prior studies that bear on this question. The results also demonstrate that recalibration is closely linked to the completion of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Vocabulary knowledge is one of the few cognitive functions that is relatively preserved in older adults, but the reasons for this relative preservation have not been well delineated. We tested the hypothesis that individual differences in vocabulary knowledge are influenced by arcuate fasciculus macrostructure (i.e., shape and volume) properties that remain stable during the aging process, rather than white matter microstructure that demonstrates age-related declines. Vocabulary was not associated with age compared to pronounced age-related declines in cognitive processing speed across 106 healthy adults (19.92–88.29 years) who participated in this neuroimaging experiment. Fractional anisotropy in the left arcuate fasciculus was significantly related to individual variability in vocabulary. This effect was present despite marked age-related differences in a T1-weighted/T2-weighted ratio (T1w/T2w) estimate of myelin that were observed throughout the left arcuate fasciculus and associated with age-related differences in cognitive processing speed. However, atypical patterns of arcuate fasciculus morphology or macrostructure were associated with decreased vocabulary knowledge. These results suggest that deterioration of tissue in the arcuate fasciculus occurs with normal aging, while having limited impact on tract organization that underlies individual differences in the acquisition and retrieval of lexical and semantic information.

Abstract = {Vocabulary size has been suggested as a useful measure of 'verbal abilities' that correlates with speech recognition scores. Knowing more words is linked to better speech recognition. How vocabulary knowledge translates to general speech recognition mechanisms, how these mechanisms relate to offline speech recognition scores, and how they may be modulated by acoustical distortion or age, is less clear. Age-related differences in linguistic measures may predict age-related differences in speech recognition in noise performance. We hypothesized that speech recognition performance can be predicted by the efficiency of lexical access, which refers to the speed with which a given word can be searched and accessed relative to the size of the mental lexicon. We tested speech recognition in a clinical German sentence-in-noise test at two signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), in 22 younger (18–35 years) and 22 older (60–78 years) listeners with normal hearing. We also assessed receptive vocabulary, lexical access time, verbal working memory, and hearing thresholds as measures of individual differences. Age group, SNR level, vocabulary size, and lexical access time were significant predictors of individual speech recognition scores, but working memory and hearing threshold were not. Interestingly, longer accessing times were correlated with better speech recognition scores. Hierarchical regression models for each subset of age group and SNR showed very similar patterns: the combination of vocabulary size and lexical access time contributed most to speech recognition performance; only for the younger group at the better SNR (yielding about 85% correct speech recognition) did vocabulary size alone predict performance. Our data suggest that successful speech recognition in noise is mainly modulated by the efficiency of lexical access. This suggests that older adults’ poorer performance in the speech recognition task may have arisen from reduced efficiency in lexical access; with an average vocabulary size similar to that of younger adults, they were still slower in lexical access.

Abstract = {The integration of a novel spoken word with existing lexical items can proceed within 24 hours of learning its phonological form. However, previous studies have reported that lexical integration of new spoken words can be delayed if semantic information is provided during learning. One possibility is that this delay in lexical integration reflects reduced phonological processing during learning as a consequence of the need to learn the semantic associations. In the current study, adult participants learnt novel words via a phoneme monitoring task, in which half of the words were associated with a picture referent, and half were phonological forms only. Critically, participants were instructed to learn the forms of the novel words, with no explicit goal to learn the word–picture mappings. Results revealed significant lexical competition effects emerging one week after consolidation, which were equivalent for the picture-present and form-only conditions. Tests of declarative memory and shadowing showed equivalent performance for picture-present and form-only words, despite participants showing good knowledge of the picture associations immediately after learning. These data support the contention that provided phonological information is recruited sufficiently well during learning, the provision of semantic information does not slow the time-course of lexical integration.

The SWF parameter allows to understand whether the grammatical class information is specified within the lexical knowledge or it is selected during post-lexical stages. We ran six lexical decision tasks employing the priming paradigm and a grammatical decision task to investigate the lexical representation of noun/verb homographs. In addition, we sought to determine the role played by the frequency of representations and the temporal activation of the grammatical class information. Our findings support the claim that these forms have independent representations for each syntactic role they can play. We interpreted these findings in the light of what we call the 'Nominal Dominance' effect, which affects the lexical access of noun/verb homographs. We also discuss the relation between nominal dominance and lexical frequency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Speech production is studied from both psycholinguistic and motor-control perspectives, with little interaction between the approaches. We assessed the explanatory value of integrating psycholinguistic and motor-control concepts for theories of speech production. By augmenting a popular psycholinguistic model of lexical retrieval with a motor-control-inspired architecture, we created a new computational model to explain speech errors in the context of aphasia. Comparing the model fits to picture-naming data from 255 aphasic patients, we found that our new model improves fits for a theoretically predictable subtype of aphasia: conduction. We discovered that the improved fits for this group were a result of strong auditory–lexical feedback activation, combined with weaker auditory–motor feedforward activation, leading to increased competition from phonologically related neighbors during lexical selection. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to other extant models of lexical retrieval. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The present study asked whether accuracy feedback on a meaning generation task would lead to improved contextual word learning (CWL). Active generation can facilitate learning by increasing task engagement and memory retrieval, which strengthens new word representations. However, forced generation results in increased errors, which can be detrimental for learning if they are not corrected. The goal of this study was to determine whether immediate feedback on response accuracy would ameliorate this risk. The study was conducted using an intelligent tutoring system, which presents target words in multiple contexts and prompts users to generate a target word meaning after each context. One group of participants (feedback group) received immediate feedback based on Markov Estimation of Semantic Association (MESA), which estimates the distance between the learner response and the target word meaning. The control group did not receive feedback. Results from conventional (pre/post-test) measures showed greater gains in accuracy and confidence for the feedback group. Moreover, when contextual support was decreased mid-way through the training (from trial 3 to trial 4), MESA measures showed a corresponding drop in accuracy, but only for the No-Feedback group. These findings suggest that accuracy feedback can improve outcomes in CWL, particularly when there is an increased risk of errors. This strengthens the case for meaning generation as a tool to build high-quality lexical representations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Text messages often contain abbreviations allowing for an efficient manner to quickly convey content. Although text abbreviations typically contain fewer letters than words, research has demonstrated that they are processed more slowly. Text abbreviations are lexically unique compared to their fully spelled counterparts. This study examined the nature of episodic memory representations for text abbreviations and how top-down contextual information influences the encoding of text abbreviations. In this experiment, participants studied sentences that contained different types of abbreviations: deletions (e.g., tmrw), substitutions (e.g., 2mrw) or 'pseudo' abbreviations (e.g., toorow). The sentences were presented within a conversational context or without context. In a recognition memory test, participants saw sentences from the study task that contained either the same abbreviation or a different type of abbreviation. Results revealed that conversational context increased both hits and false recognition rates in the memory test. False recognition rates were generally higher for abbreviation types that shared more surface feature overlap and lower for those that shared less surface feature overlap. The findings suggest text abbreviations have distinct episodic memory representations that incorporate their unique surface feature information and are closely associated to fully spelled lexical memory representations.

Abstract = {Previous research has shown the importance of sublexical orthographic cues in determining the language of a given word when the two languages of a bilingual reader share the same script. In this study, we explored the extent to which cross-language sublexical characteristics of words—measured in terms of bigram frequencies—constrain selective language activation during reading. In Experiment 1, we investigated the impact of language-nonspecific and language-specific orthography in letter detection using the Reicher–Wheeler paradigm in a seemingly monolingual experimental context. In Experiment 2, we used the masked translation priming paradigm in order to better characterize the role of sublexical language cues during lexical access in bilinguals. Results show that bilinguals are highly sensitive to statistical orthographic regularities of their languages and that the absence of such cues promotes language-nonspecific lexical access, whereas their presence partially reduces parallel language activation. We conclude that language coactivation in bilinguals is highly modulated by sublexical processing and that orthographic regularities of the two languages of a bilingual are a determining factor in lexical access.

Abstract = {Background: A number of experiments with skilled adult readers have shown that a transposed-letter pseudoword (e.g., CHOLOCATE) is considerably more word-like than a control replacement-letter pseudoword (e.g., CHOTONATE). For instance, in lexical decision, response times are longer and less accurate for CHOLOCATE than for CHOTONATE (i.e., a transposed-letter effect). Method: Here, we examined how letter position coding is attained in individuals who excel in orthographic-lexical processing: competitive Scrabble players. To this end, we conducted a lexical decision experiment with two types of pseudowords (transposed-letter vs. replacement-letter pseudowords). Results: Data showed that while the transposed-letter effect does occur in expert Scrabble players, the magnitude of the effect is dramatically smaller than in a control group of university students—in particular, for the accuracy data. Conclusions: The parameters responsible for the flexibility of letter position coding in models of visual word recognition must be modulated by the degree of expertise in orthographic-lexical processing.

The lexical structure of this information might permit automatic indexing and improved retrieval. Objective To determine the possibility of identifying the key elements of clinical studies, namely Patient-Population-Problem, Exposure-Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Duration and Results (PECODR), from abstracts of medical journals. Methods We used a convenience sample of 20 synopses from the journal Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) and their matching original journal article abstracts obtained from PubMed. Three independent primary care professionals identified PECODR-related extracts of text. Rules were developed to define each PECODR element and the selection process of characters, words, phrases and sentences.

Abstract = {Producing a word requires selecting among a set of similar alternatives. When many semantically related items become activated, the difficulty of the selection process is increased. Experiment 1 tested naming of items with either multiple synonymous labels ('Alternate Names,' e.g., gift/present) or closely semantically related but non-equivalent responses ('Near Semantic Neighbors,' e.g., jam/jelly). Picture naming was fastest and most accurate for pictures with only one label ('High Name Agreement'), slower and less accurate in the Alternate Names condition, and slowest and least accurate in the Near Semantic Neighbors condition. These results suggest that selection mechanisms in picture naming operate at two distinct levels of processing: selecting between similar but non-equivalent names requires two selection processes (semantic and lexical), whereas selecting among equivalent names only requires one selection at the lexical level. Experiment 2 examined how these selection mechanisms are affected by normal aging and found that older adults had significantly more difficulty in the Near Semantic Neighbors condition, but not in the Alternate Names condition. This suggests that aging affects semantic processing and selection more strongly than it affects lexical selection. Experiment 3 examined the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in these selection processes by testing individuals with aphasia secondary to stroke lesions that either affected the LIFG or spared it. Surprisingly, there was no interaction between condition and lesion group: the presence of LIFG damage was not associated with substantively worse naming performance for pictures with multiple acceptable labels. These results are not consistent with a simple view of LIFG as the locus of lexical selection and suggest a more nuanced view of the neural basis of lexical and semantic selection.

Abstract = {This paper explores the representations underlying lexical semantics. In particular, we test whether a word’s meaning can affect a word’s articulation. In Experiment 1, participants produced high-effort (e.g., yelling) and low-effort (e.g., chatting) words that are semantically related to articulation, as well as words that are semantically unrelated to articulation (e.g., kicking). We found that vocal words were produced with greater intensity than non-vocal words. In Experiment 2, we explored the specificity of this effect by investigating how words semantically related to the mouth, but unrelated to vocalization (e.g., chewing) were articulated. Analyses revealed that mouth words did not differ from controls, and we replicated the vocal effects from Experiment 1, suggesting fine-grain motor activation from lexical semantics. Experiment 3 revealed that the semantics of a verb influences the prosodic intensity of a sentence prior to the onset of the verb. Together, these data suggest aspects of lexical meaning influence prosody, and that motor representations may underlie lexical semantics.

Abstract = {When naming pictures, categorically-related compared to unrelated contexts typically slow production. We investigated proposed roles for the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and posterior middle and superior temporal gyri (pMTG/STG) in mediating this semantic interference effect. In a three-way, cross-over, sham-controlled study, we applied online anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (atDCS) to LIFG or pMTG/STG while 24 participants performed parallel versions of the blocked cyclic naming paradigm. Significant effects of semantic context and cycle, and interactions of context and cycle, were observed on naming latencies in all three stimulation sessions. Additionally, atDCS over left pMTG/STG facilitated naming in related blocks from the second cycle onward, significantly reducing but not eliminating the interference effect. Applying atDCS over left LIFG likewise reduced the magnitude of interference compared to sham stimulation, although the facilitation was limited to the first few cycles of naming. We interpret these results as indicating semantic interference in picture naming reflects contributions of two complementary mechanisms: a relatively short-lived, top-down mechanism to bias selection and a more persistent lexical-level activation mechanism.

Abstract = {This study explored the effects of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention on reading, attention, and psychological well-being among people with developmental dyslexia and/or attention deficits. Various types of dyslexia exist, characterized by different error types. We examined a question that has not been tested so far: which types of errors (and dyslexias) are affected by MBSR training. To do so, we tested, using an extensive battery of reading tests, whether each participant had dyslexia, and which errors types s/he makes, and then compared the rate of each error type before and after the MBSR workshop. We used a similar approach to attention disorders: we evaluated the participants’ sustained, selective, executive, and orienting of attention to assess whether they had attention-disorders, and if so, which functions were impaired. We then evaluated the effect of MBSR on each of the attention functions. Psychological measures including mindfulness, stress, reflection and rumination, life-satisfaction, depression, anxiety, and sleep-disturbances were also evaluated. Nineteen Hebrew-readers completed a 2-month mindfulness workshop. The results showed that whereas reading errors of letter-migrations within and between words and vowel-letter errors did not decrease following the workshop, most participants made fewer reading errors in general following the workshop, with a significant reduction of 19% from their original number of errors. This decrease mainly resulted from a decrease in errors that occur due to reading via the sublexical rather than the lexical route. It seems, therefore, that mindfulness helped reading by keeping the readers on the lexical route. This improvement in reading probably resulted from improved sustained attention: the reduction in sublexical reading was significant for the dyslexic participants who also had attention deficits, and there were significant correlations between reduced reading errors and decreases in impulsivity. Following the meditation workshop, the rate of commission errors decreased, indicating decreased impulsivity, and the variation in RTs in the CPT task decreased, indicating improved sustained attention. Significant improvements were obtained in participants’ mindfulness, perceived-stress, rumination, depression, state-anxiety, and sleep-disturbances. Correlations were also obtained between reading improvement and increased mindfulness following the workshop. Thus, whereas mindfulness training did not affect specific types of errors and did not improve dyslexia, it did affect the reading of adults with developmental dyslexia and ADHD, by helping them to stay on the straight path of the lexical route while reading. Thus, the reading improvement induced by mindfulness sheds light on the intricate relation between attention and reading. Mindfulness reduced impulsivity and improved sustained attention, and this, in turn, improved reading of adults with developmental dyslexia and ADHD, by helping them to read via the straight path of the lexical route.

Abstract = {The models advanced to explain right hemisphere (RH) language function can be divided into two main types. According to the older (lower-level) models, RH language reflects the ontogenesis of conceptual and semantic-lexical development; the more recent models, on the other hand, suggest that the RH plays an important role in the use of higher-level language functions, such as metaphors, to convey complex, abstract concepts. The hypothesis that the RH may be preferentially involved in processing the semantic-lexical components of language was advanced by Zaidel in splitbrain patients and his model was confirmed by neuropsychological investigations, proving that right brain-damaged patients show selective semanticlexical disorders. The possible links between lower and higher levels of RH language are discussed, as is the hypothesis that the RH may have privileged access to the figurative aspects of novel metaphorical expressions, whereas conventionalization of metaphorical meaning could be a bilaterally-mediated process involving abstract semantic-lexical codes.

Abstract = {The way in which an event is packaged linguistically can be informative about the number of participants in the event and the nature of their participation. At times, however, a sentence is ambiguous, and pragmatic information weighs in to favor one interpretation over another. Whereas adults may readily know how to pick up on such cues to meaning, children—who are generally naïve to such pragmatic nuances—may diverge and access a broader range of interpretations or one disfavored by adults. A number of cases come to us from a now well-established body of research on scalar implicatures and scopal ambiguity. Here, we complement this previous work with a previously uninvestigated example of the semantic-pragmatic divide in language development arising from the interpretation of sentences with pluralities and together. Sentences such as Two boys lifted a block (together) allow for either a Collective or a Distributive interpretation (one pushing event vs. two spatiotemporally coordinated events). We show experimentally that children allow both interpretations in sentences with together, whereas adults rule out the Distributive interpretation without further contextual motivation. However, children appear to be guided by their semantics in the readings they access, since they do not allow readings that are semantically barred. We argue that they are unaware of the pragmatic information adults have at their fingertips, such as the conversational implicatures arising from the presence of a modifier, the probability of its occurrence being used to signal a particular interpretation among a set of alternatives, and knowledge of the possible lexical alternatives.

Abstract = {Background: Children with specific language impairment (SLI) often experience word‐learning difficulties, which are suggested to originate in the early stage of word learning: fast mapping. Some previous research indicates significantly poorer fast mapping capabilities in children with SLI compared with typically developing (TD) counterparts, with a range of methodological factors impacting on the consistency of this finding. Research has explored key issues that might underlie fast mapping difficulties in children with SLI, with strong theoretical support but little empirical evidence for the role of phonological short‐term memory (STM). Additionally, further research is required to explore the influence of receptive vocabulary on fast mapping capabilities. Understanding the factors associated with fast mapping difficulties that are experienced by children with SLI may lead to greater theoretically driven word‐learning intervention. Aims: To investigate whether children with SLI demonstrate significant difficulties with fast mapping, and to explore the related factors. It was hypothesized that children with SLI would score significantly lower on a fast mapping production task compared with TD children, and that phonological STM and receptive vocabulary would significantly predict fast mapping production scores in both groups of children. Methods & Procedures: Twenty‐three children with SLI (mean = 64.39 months, SD = 4.10 months) and 26 TD children (mean = 65.92 months, SD = 2.98) were recruited from specialist language and mainstream schools. All participants took part in a unique, interactive fast‐mapping task whereby nine novel objects with non‐word labels were presented and production accuracy was assessed. A non‐word repetition test and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test—Fourth Edition (PPVT‐IV) were also administered as measures of phonological STM capacity and receptive vocabulary, respectively. Outcomes & Results: Results of the fast‐mapping task indicated that children with SLI had significantly poorer fast mapping production scores than TD children. Scores from the non‐word repetition task were also significantly lower for the SLI group, revealing reduced phonological STM capacity. Phonological STM capacity and receptive vocabulary emerged as significant predictors of fast mapping performance when the group data were combined in a multiple regression analysis. Conclusions & Implications: These results suggest that the word‐learning difficulties experienced by children with SLI may originate at the fast mapping stage, and that phonological STM and receptive vocabulary significantly predict fast mapping ability. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of word‐learning difficulties in children with SLI and may inform lexical learning intervention.

Abstract = {The main goal of the present study was to investigate how the degree of orthographic overlap between translation equivalents influences bilingual word recognition processes at different stages of reading development. Spanish–Basque bilingual children with ages ranging from 8 to 15 years were tested in an explicit translation recognition task with a large set of items. Critically, the degree of cross-language similarity (i.e. the cognate status) between the references and the correct targets was manipulated along a continuum in order to investigate how the reliance on cross-language orthographic overlap varies as a function of reading experience. Results showed that younger children were significantly more sensitive to the cognate status of words than older children while recognising translation equivalents, and that this difference did not depend on the speed of response of the participants. These results demonstrate that the influence of cross-language similarity progressively diminishes as a function of increased exposure to print together with the maturation of the mechanisms responsible for language interference suppression, as suggested by developmental models of bilingual lexical access.

Abstract = {Despite much evidence for the positive effects of L1 and L2 glosses on incidental vocabulary acquisition, their relative effectiveness remains unsettled. Furthermore, how such glosses affect lexical representations remains unknown. To address these points, 180 native speakers of Korean (10th graders) were assigned to one of three groups to read an English story containing either L1 (Korean) or L2 (English) glosses, or the same story without glosses. Immediately and one week later, the three groups were instructed to recall the meanings of target words in their choice of L1 or L2. The target words consisted of two sets: a set of words occurring twice (F2 words) or four times (F4 words), respectively. The results showed that although the L1 and L2 groups did not differ in their short-term retention of the F2 and F4 words, the L1 group outperformed the L2 group in the long-term retention of F4 words, but not F2 words. Further, the L1 group recalled the meanings of novel word forms predominantly in the L1 (Korean), whereas the L2 group showed mixed results (approximately 75% in the L2 and 25% in the L1). These results suggest that lexical processing and storage mechanisms may vary significantly depending on the gloss type, resulting in both a quantitatively and qualitatively different impact on L2 lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {Communicating meaningful messages is the ultimate goal of language production. Yet, verbal messages can differ widely in the complexity and richness of their semantic content, and such differences should strongly modulate conceptual and lexical encoding processes during speech planning. However, despite the crucial role of semantic content in language production, the influence of this variability is currently unclear. Here, we investigate influences of the number of associated semantic features and intercorrelational feature density on language production during picture naming. While the number of semantic features facilitated naming, intercorrelational feature density inhibited naming. Both effects follow naturally from the assumption of conceptual facilitation and simultaneous lexical competition. They are difficult to accommodate with language production theories dismissing lexical competition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The data come from diary and audio recordings which include the utterances produced by an American English-speaking child, L, between the ages 1;08 and 3;05. We extracted all the finite complement-clause constructions that L produced and compared the grammatical acceptability of these utterances with that of the simple sentences of the same length produced within the same two weeks and with that of the simple sentences containing the same verb produced within the same month. The results show that L is more likely to make syntactic errors in finite complement-clause constructions than she does in her simple sentences of the same length or with the same verb. This suggests that the errors are more likely to arise from the syntactic and semantic coordination of the two clauses rather than limitations in performance or lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {Exposure to L2 orthography may help L2 learners distinguish a novel segmental (e.g., Escudero et al., 2008) and tonal contrast (Showalter & Hayes-Harb, 2013). However, little is known about whether learners can associate two phonetic variants with the same lexical entry when the orthographic form of the word is provided during learning. Thus, the goal of this dissertation is to investigate whether exposure to L2 orthography could help learners link two free variants with one lexical entry and whether Taiwanese and American participants will show different degrees of reliance on orthography in word learning. Four experiments were conducted in the current study. Experiment 1 examined whether orthography can help learners learn the [?-u] free variation in an artificial language using a word learning paradigm modified from Hayes-Harb, Nicol, and Barker (2010). No effect of orthography on the learning of vocalic free variation was found in Experiment 1, and both L1 groups showed low detection of the vowel alternations. A follow-up picture naming task investigating learners' encoding and decoding of the words was conducted in Experiment 2. The results from Experiment 2 showed that orthography did help learners score higher in picture naming and also produce more new forms of the free variants. Experiment 3 and 4 paralleled 1 and 2, respectively, but the target alternation was consonantal (i.e., [p-b] or [t-d] counterbalanced). An effect of orthography on the learning of [p-b] free variation (but not [t-d]) was found in Experiment 3. Compared to Experiment 1, only Americans showed better detection of the consonantal alternations but not Taiwanese. Experiment 4, a picture-naming task, was a follow-up of Experiment 3. It was found that, unlike in Experiment 2, orthography in this case did not always help learners score higher in production. In sum, mixed results regarding the effect of orthography on the learning of free variation were found. In general, the effect of orthography was stronger in production than in recognition. The findings reported in this dissertation add support to the role of orthographic information in lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In printed-word perception, the orthographic neighborhood effect (i.e., faster recognition of words with more neighbors) has considerable theoretical importance, because it implicates great interactivity in lexical access. Mulatti, Reynolds, and Besner Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 32, 799–810 (2006) questioned the validity of orthographic neighborhood effects, suggesting that they reflect a confound with phonological neighborhood density. They reported that, when phonological density is controlled, orthographic neighborhood effects vanish. Conversely, phonological neighborhood effects were still evident even when controlling for orthographic neighborhood density. The present study was a replication and extension of Mulatti et al. (2006), with words presented in four different formats (computer-generated print and cursive, and handwritten print and cursive). The results from Mulatti et al. (2006) were replicated with computer-generated stimuli, but were reversed with natural stimuli. These results suggest that, when ambiguity is introduced at the level of individual letters, top-down influences from lexical neighbors are increased.

Abstract = {In Latin, a short vowel followed by a voiced plosive undergoes lengthening in the past participle (Lachmann’s law). Many of these ppp. show a nasal segment inherited from the present or perfect stem. In a few ppp. moving from a dental stem, such as pēnsus, spōnsus etc., such a spreading provides the condition for the formation of the cluster -ns- (< -nd- + -to). By observing the supposed omission of -n- in some of these verbal forms (e.g.: frēsus vs. frĕndo), regardless of the effective status of the process, as opposed to its retention in other ones (e.g.: pēnsus vs. pĕndeo/pĕndo), Latin speakers could have hypothesized that all ppp. forms of this group were originally provided with -n-, see e.g. frēsus < frĕnsus, with loss of -n- and compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel. The ‘NS-lengthening’ rule might represent an early trigger of the vowel lengthening described by Lachmann. Such a lengthening analogically spread to other ppp., according to a connectionist lexical process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Observers exhibit larger leftward bias when bisecting words compared with lines. According to the Attentional Scaling Hypothesis, attempting to access lexical entries involves focusing attention on the initial letters of words to establish a cohort of potential matches with entries in the mental lexicon. We test this account by examining two predictions: (1) greater leftward bias for words should be evident in English readers in which the word beginning is on the left but not in Hebrew readers. (2) Dyslexics who have lexical impairments should show greater bias. Results reveal that word length modulated bisection bias differently for Hebrew and English readers, although the bias stays always leftward. Furthermore, dyslexics exhibited an exaggerated leftward bias than controls. We propose this effect arises from an interaction between reading and spatial attention rather than from the scaling of attention relative to the beginning of the word in the service of lexical access.

Sephardic Modern Hebrew exhibits multiple strategies in order to avoid the proximity of non-low vowels to pharyngeals.

Abstract = {The E-Z Reader 10 model of eye movements in reading (Reichle, Warren, & McConnell, 2009) posits that the process of word identification strictly precedes the process of integration of a word into its syntactic and semantic context. The present study reports a single large-scale (N = 112) eyetracking experiment in which the frequency and plausibility of a target word in each sentence were factorially manipulated. The results were consistent with E-Z Reader’s central predictions: frequency but not plausibility influenced the probability that the word was skipped over by the eyes rather than directly fixated, and the two variables had additive, not interactive, effects on all reading time measures. Evidence in favor of null effects and null interactions was obtained by computing Bayes factors, using the default priors and sampling methods for ANOVA models implemented by Rouder, Morey, Speckman, and Province (2012). The results suggest that though a word’s plausibility may have a measurable influence as early as the first fixation duration on the target word, in fact plausibility may be influencing only a post-lexical processing stage, rather than lexical identification itself.

Abstract = {Objects presented in categorically related contexts are typically named slower than objects presented in unrelated contexts, a phenomenon termed semantic interference. However, not all semantic relationships induce interference. In the present study, we investigated the influence of object part-relations in the blocked cyclic naming paradigm. In Experiment 1 we established that an object's parts do induce a semantic interference effect when named in context compared to unrelated parts (e.g., leaf, root, nut, bark; for tree). In Experiment 2) we replicated the effect during perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the cerebral regions involved. The interference effect was associated with significant perfusion signal increases in the hippocampal formation and decreases in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We failed to observe significant perfusion signal changes in the left lateral temporal lobe, a region that shows reliable activity for interference effects induced by categorical relations in the same paradigm and is proposed to mediate lexical-semantic processing. We interpret these results as supporting recent explanations of semantic interference in blocked cyclic naming that implicate working memory mechanisms. However, given the failure to observe significant perfusion signal changes in the left temporal lobe, the results provide only partial support for accounts that assume semantic interference in this paradigm arises solely due to lexical-level processes.

Abstract = {Understanding speech is effortless in ideal situations, and although adverse conditions, such as caused by hearing impairment, often render it an effortful task, they do not necessarily suspend speech comprehension. A prime example of this is speech perception by cochlear implant users, whose hearing prostheses transmit speech as a significantly degraded signal. It is yet unknown how mechanisms of speech processing deal with such degraded signals, and whether they are affected by effortful processing of speech. This paper compares the automatic process of lexical competition between natural and degraded speech, and combines gaze fixations, which capture the course of lexical disambiguation, with pupillometry, which quantifies the mental effort involved in processing speech. Listeners’ ocular responses were recorded during disambiguation of lexical embeddings with matching and mismatching durational cues. Durational cues were selected due to their substantial role in listeners’ quick limitation of the number of lexical candidates for lexical access in natural speech. Results showed that lexical competition increased mental effort in processing natural stimuli in particular in presence of mismatching cues. Signal degradation reduced listeners’ ability to quickly integrate durational cues in lexical selection, and delayed and prolonged lexical competition. The effort of processing degraded speech was increased overall, and because it had its sources at the pre-lexical level this effect can be attributed to listening to degraded speech rather than to lexical disambiguation. In sum, the course of lexical competition was largely comparable for natural and degraded speech, but showed crucial shifts in timing, and different sources of increased mental effort. We argue that well-timed progress of information from sensory to pre-lexical and lexical stages of processing, which is the result of perceptual adaptation during speech development, is the reason why in ideal situations speech is perceived as an undemanding task. Degradation of the signal or the receiver channel can quickly bring this well-adjusted timing out of balance and lead to increase in mental effort. Incomplete and effortful processing at the early pre-lexical stages has its consequences on lexical processing as it adds uncertainty to the forming and revising of lexical hypotheses.

Abstract = {Letter substitution has been shown to have a cost to word recognition performance, such as increased reaction time. The use of orthographically similar numbers or symbols as a substitute for letters is known as LEET. Perea, Duñabeitia, and Carreiras (2008) showed that word recognition was not affected when LEET substitutions were used as primes. This study examined whether the effects of LEET prime substitutions would remain constant across word frequency. The apparent lack of substitution costs may have been an effect of word-level processing such as holistic bias for high-frequency words. Evidence that LEET does not have an appreciable cost to performance across word frequency suggests that such orthographic substitutions are processed much like normally lettered words, which supported Perea et al.'s findings. It was suggested that LEET substitutions offset substitution costs because of orthography (because of more complete processing of nonsubstituted letters) rather than lexical effects (i.e., holistic bias).

Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that when speakers of European languages are asked to turn nonwords into words by altering either a vowel or consonant, they tend to treat vowels as more mutable than consonants. These results inspired the universal vowel mutability hypothesis: listeners learn to cope with vowel variability because vowel information constrains lexical selection less tightly and allows for more potential candidates than does consonant information. The present study extends the word reconstruction paradigm to Mandarin Chinese–a Sino-Tibetan language, which makes use of lexically contrastive tone. Native speakers listened to word-like nonwords (e.g., su3) and were asked to change them into words by manipulating a single consonant (e.g., tu3), vowel (e.g., si3), or tone (e.g., su4). Additionally, items were presented in a fourth condition in which participants could change any part. The participants’ reaction times and responses were recorded. Results revealed that participants responded faster and more accurately in both the free response and the tonal change conditions. Unlike previous reconstruction studies on European languages, where vowels were changed faster and more often than consonants, these results demonstrate that, in Mandarin, changes to vowels and consonants were both overshadowed by changes to tone, which was the preferred modification to the stimulus nonwords, while changes to vowels were the slowest and least accurate. Our findings show that the universal vowel mutability hypothesis is not consistent with a tonal language, that Mandarin tonal information is lower-priority than consonants and vowels and that vowel information most tightly constrains Mandarin lexical access.

Abstract = {This study is about the role of elicited verbal imitation in toddler word learning. Forty-eight toddlers were taught eight nonwords linked to referents. During training, they were asked to imitate the nonwords. Naming of the referents was tested at three intervals (one minute later [uncued], five minutes, and 1–7 days later [cued]) and recognition at the last two intervals. Receptive vocabulary, nonword repetition, and expressive phonology were assessed. The accuracy of elicited imitation during training predicted naming at one and five minutes, but not 1–7 days later. Neither nonword repetition nor expressive phonology was associated with naming over time but extant vocabulary predicted performance at all time intervals. We hypothesize that elicited imitation facilitates word learning in its earliest stages by supporting encoding of the word form into memory and allowing practice of the articulatory-phonological plan. At later stages, vocabulary facilitates integration of the word form into the lexical network. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The current study investigated school-aged children's internalization of the distributional patterns of English lexical stress as a function of vocabulary size. Sixty children (5;3 to 8;3) participated in the study. The children were asked to blend two individually presented, equally stressed syllables to produce disyllabic nonwords with different resulting structures in one of two frame sentences. The frame sentences were designed to elicit either a noun or verb interpretation of the nonword. Children's receptive vocabulary was also assessed. The results indicated that children more readily blended syllable pairs that resulted in trochaic-compatible word structures than in iambic-compatible structures. This effect was strongest in young children with large vocabularies. As for stress placement, all children were sensitive to the effect of word structure, but only children with the largest vocabularies were sensitive to the biasing effect of grammatical category (noun = trochee; verb = iamb). The study results are discussed with reference to the observation that speech motor skills develop in tandem with lexical acquisition and the hypothesis that phonological knowledge emerges in part from abstraction across lexical representations.

Abstract = {Native speakers with different linguistic backgrounds differ in their usage of language, and particularly in their vocabulary. For instance, British natives would use the word 'holiday' when American natives would prefer the word 'vacation'. This study investigates how cross-dialectal lexical variation impacts lexical processing. Electrophysiological responses were recorded, while British natives listened to British or American speech in which lexical frequency dominance across dialects was manipulated (British versus American vocabulary). Words inconsistent with the dialect of the speaker (British words uttered by American speakers and vice versa) elicited larger negative electrophysiological deflections than consistent words, 700 ms after stimulus onset. Thus, processing of British words was easier when listening to British speakers and processing of American words was easier when listening to American speakers. These results show that listeners integrate their knowledge about cross-dialectal lexical variations in vocabulary as speech unfolds, as it was previously shown for social lexical variations.

Abstract = {Behavioural and neuroimaging studies provide evidence of automatic activation of phonology (e.g., covert speech) during the recognition of lexical stimuli. Implicit processing of phonological information was investigated in a kinematic study of semantic categorisation of pictures (session A) or words (session B). Participants clicked one of two items (target and distractor) based on their semantic congruency (artefact or natural) with a cued-word. Phonological similarity between cued-word and distractor was varied. The presence of the phonological distractor produced trajectories with greater curvature towards the competing semantic category than did the presence of a distractor not phonologically related. This suggests that the semantic categorisation of pictorial and lexical stimuli is influenced by the automatic activation of phonological information. Trajectories’ curvature reveals competition between partially activated phonological and semantic representations suggesting that phonological codes involved in linguistic processing influence the dynamic competition underlying the semantic categorisation of lexical and pictorial.

Abstract = {In this chapter we will discuss several approaches offered in the literature to explain children's performance on referential dependencies. We will discuss cross-linguistic variation, and structure sensitivity of children's interpretation of pronouns. The discussion of children's performance on pronouns will be followed by a discussion of children's performance on reflexives. The studies on children’s interpretation of pronouns and reflexives reviewed in this chapter point at a relatively early mastery of linguistic principles such as Principle A and B, provided a balanced experimental design is used. The cross-linguistic evidence also indicates that the language specific syntactic and semantic properties of (clitic) pronouns are acquired before the age of 5. Recent developments in linguistic theory, particularly the Binding Theory, and cross-linguistic acquisition research have shown that children’s difficulties with the interpretation of pronouns and reflexives are to be found at the interfaces between syntax and discourse or semantics, and may be due to limited (syntactic) processing resources. In addition, children’s performance on logophors and long-distance reflexives suggests that the acquisition of pragmatics and particular properties of lexical items are relatively late.

Abstract = {The ultimate goal of reading is to construct text meanings based on the linguistic information encoded in print. Word recognition entails an assortment of operations, including analyzing a grapheme, extracting phonological and morphological information from the grapheme, identifying its lexical entry, and retrieving its meaning. Efficient word recognition necessitates lexical and sub-lexical knowledge, and, perhaps more critically, the ability to use the knowledge effortlessly for extracting and integrating visually presented information in printed words. Although word recognition is universally required, the subskills it requires vary widely across languages. Such variation has a significant implication for second language (L2) reading research because L2 reading development is jointly affected by the language-specific demands imposed by the properties of two languages. This chapter provides a brief overview of the universal and language-specific constraints on L2 word recognition development and resulting cross-linguistic interactions in L2 lexical information processing.

Abstract = {The primary goal of this dissertation is to characterize the relative strength of two of the influences on the parser's behavior during ambiguity resolution: coreference dependency formation and verb frame preference. I find that coreference dependency formation exerts a stronger influence on the parser than does verb frame preference, even when verb frame preference is maximized in transitively biased frames. Previous studies have shown local attachment bias initially directs the parser to an embedded object analysis in sentences like (1), in which the DP Annie's melody is locally ambiguous between the embedded object (EO)/matrix subject (MS) analyses (Ferreira and Henderson, 1990). (1) Whenever she was trying to casually hum Annie's melody was beautiful. Additionally, (1) contains a cataphoric pronoun she which triggers an active search for an antecedent, whereby the parser seeks the antecedent only in grammatically sanctioned positions, such as where the antecedent is not c-commanded by the pronoun (Kazanina et al., 2007; van Gompel and Liversedge, 2003). In (1), the closest potential antecedent is Annie. However, it can be the antecedent only if the DP that contains it is analyzed as the MS, thus outside the whenever-clause and not c-commanded by she. A bias toward an early cataphoric dependency formation could lead the parser to analyze the ambiguous DP as the MS. In (1), there is a bias toward a MS analysis from the antecedent search in addition to a bias toward the local attachment EO analysis. I find that, regardless of the transitivity bias of the verb in the position of hums, the parser forms a dependency between the pronoun she and Annie. This indicates that dependency formation can supersede verb frame preferences and any default preference the parser may have toward local attachment (Phillips and Gibson, 1997). Moreover, I also observe effects attributable to both the MS and EO parses. This suggests that the parser builds both alternatives and maintains them in parallel. From this, I conclude that the parser prioritizes information from an ongoing dependency search over lexical properties during ambiguity resolution.

Abstract = {The goal of this project was to investigate the relationship between executive attention and specific linguistic and control processes during goal-directed tasks in aphasia. Its central premise was that PWA often possess dissociable impairments in linguistic processes and in the mechanisms that control and efficiently utilize those processes. The motivation for this claim was based on observations that PWA often present with deficits in the online processing of linguistic information, which in some instances have been interpreted as evidence for impaired linguistic operations, but in others has been interpreted as evidence for impaired control of language processing due to more general cognitive constraints. The current work tested claims regarding the Executive Attention model (Engle and Kane, 2004) in aphasia and its relation to varying task sets in linguistic and nonlinguistic tasks. 20 PWA and 23 matched controls were tested on four tasks measuring executive attention in verbal and nonverbal domains using word-picture interference, semantic and perceptual go/no-go, and spatial Stroop designs. Participants were also tested on lexical decision and numerosity judgment tasks with varying speed and accuracy-focused instructions, with performance modeled using the Diffusion Model (Ratcliff, 1978). Overall, the current work found evidence for the predicted domain-general and domain-specific impairments in executive attention at the level of individual PWA. However, these executive attention deficits did not appear to be associated with difficulties adapting to shifting speed-accuracy constraints. In addition, group-level patterns of performance across experiments suggest an additional related executive control deficit in the area of generating and maintaining arbitrary stimulus-response mappings. This study also demonstrated the appropriateness and potential applicability of the diffusion model in aphasia research, and diffusion model analyses found that PWA had difficulty adjusting their nondecision times in response to speed constraints, had lower drift rates in lexical decision, which reflected inefficient processing of lexical information, and had a disproportionately difficult time efficiently processing easy stimuli in lexical and numerosity tasks.

Abstract = {This study explores the time-course of word processing by grammatical class (verbs vs. nouns) and meaning (action vs. non-action) by means of an ERP experiment. The morphology of Spanish words allows for a noun (e.g., bail-e [a dance]) or a verb (e.g., bail-ar [to dance]) to be formed by simply changing the suffix attached to the root. This facility results in a set of nouns and verbs that are nearly matched in meaning, because of their shared root. The results show that grammatical class of words is processed very early, around 200 ms after the word onset, with the effects remaining activated at left frontal regions until 800 ms. Later components show a focal LAN sensitive to the noun-verb distinction, and a broadly distributed N400-like waveform sensitive to meaning. The different components affected by grammar (P200 and LAN) and meaning (N400) and their topographical dissimilarity seem to indicate an independent neural processing of these two linguistic properties and support a lex)},

Abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of how the visual-world eye-tracking paradigm has been used to investigate the processing and representation of discourse-level information. The chapter starts by reviewing some theoretical approaches to information structure, and then turns to visual-world experiments on the prosodic and syntactic reflexes of information structure, as well as the consequences of information structure for reference resolution. The notion of 'prominence' plays a central role in many of these investigations, in the shape of prosodic prominence (associated with new information), syntactic prominence (often associated with given or topical information) and representational prominence/accessibility in the domain of reference resolution. Comprehenders use prominence-related information to guide discourse-level aspects of processing, but prosodic prominence and syntactic prominence have different information-structural correlates. Furthermore, if we want to conceptualize reference resolution as a process sensitive to the prominence of mental representations, our view of what factors influence referential prominence needs to include not only entity-related factors (e.g. givenness), but also event-related factors (e.g. verb semantics and coherence relations between events). As a whole, the findings discussed in this chapter highlight the rapidity with which the human language processing system uses of discourse-level information, whether it be encoded in pitch accents, word order or the form of referring expressions. These findings suggest that discourse-level comprehension should not be relegated to a secondary stage of processing and instead occurs in tandem with other aspects of language comprehension, such as lexical access and syntactic processing.

Abstract = {The purpose of the current research was to investigate the relationship between AAE, complex syntax, and lexical diversity in adolescent African American English speaking students in spoken and written language. Previous studies (Craig & Washington, 1994, 1995) have found a positive relationship between AAE use and complex syntax in spoken language. The study also investigated the relationship of AAE use, vocabulary, and lexical diversity. Participants were 32 (16 boys, 16 girls) typically developing 7th grade middle school students. All participants were classified as low, moderate, and high users of African American English. Spoken and written samples were analyzed for complex syntax, vocabulary use (Tier 2 and 3 words), and lexical diversity. There were no significant differences in syntactic complexity, TTR, and vocabulary use as a function of AAE use. The only significant correlations between AAE use and these measures were in the low moderate range (r = .32-.36). The findings of this study were thus inconsistent with previous studies by Craig and Washington (1994, 1995), but were consistent with the more recent study by Jackson and Roberts (2001). Future studies should continue to examine how AAE changes overtime and how AAE use may influence syntactic and lexical aspects of language.

Abstract = {To identify the stages of language processing at which language switching takes place, we examined the effect of partially temporally overlapping language processing on language switch costs in a dual-task study, in which we varied the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), the language (German–English), and the language sequence (language repetition trials and language switch trials). Using language comprehension tasks, the data revealed an effect of SOA (i.e., the 'PRP' effect) and language switch costs. However, we did not find any influence of SOA on language switch costs, which suggests that language switches occur at the stages of lexical selection or post-selection processing. Thus, the findings of the present study provide evidence for models that assume language control to occur during or after lexical selection.

Abstract = {Background: Phonological priming has been shown to facilitate naming in individuals with aphasia, as well as healthy speakers, resulting in faster naming latencies. However, the mechanisms of phonological facilitation (PF) in aphasia remain unclear. Aims: Within discrete vs. interactive models of lexical access, this study examined whether PF occurs via the sub-lexical or lexical route during noun and verb naming in agrammatic and anomic aphasia. Methods & Procedures: Thirteen participants with agrammatic aphasia and 10 participants with anomic aphasia and their young and age-matched controls (n = 20/each) were tested. Experiment 1 examined noun and verb naming deficit patterns in an off-line confrontation naming task. Experiment 2 examined PF effects on naming both word categories using eyetracking priming paradigm. Outcomes & Results: Results of Experiment 1 showed greater naming difficulty for verbs than for nouns in the agrammatic group, with no difference between the two word categories in the anomic group. For both participant groups, errors were dominated by semantic paraphasias, indicating impaired lexical selection. In the phonological priming task (Experiment 2), young and age-matched control groups showed PF in both noun and verb naming. Interestingly, the agrammatic group showed PF when naming verbs, but not nouns, whereas the anomic group showed PF for nouns only. Conclusions: Consistent with lexically mediated PF in interactive models of lexical access, selective PF for different word categories in our agrammatic and anomic groups suggest that phonological primes facilitate lexical selection via feedback activation, resulting in greater PF for more difficult (i.e., verbs in agrammatic and possibly nouns in anomic group) lexical items.

Abstract = {Many English phonemes have more than one possible spelling. People’s choices among the options may be influenced by sublexical patterns, such as the identity of neighboring sounds within the word. However, little research has explored the possible role of lexical conditioning. Three experiments examined the potential effects of one such factor: whether an item is typical of English or atypical. In Experiment 1, we asked whether presenting pseudowords as made-up words or the names of monsters would cause participants to classify them as atypical and spell phonemes within these pseudowords using less common patterns. This was not found to be the case in children (aged 7–12 years) or adults. In Experiment 2, children aged 10–12 and adults spelled pseudowords that contained phonologically frequent or infrequent sequences and, in Experiment 3, adults chose between two possible spellings of each of these pseudowords. Adults, but not children, used more common spellings in pseudowords that contained frequent sequences and that thus seemed more typical of English. They used fewer common spellings in pseudowords that contained infrequent sequences and therefore seemed atypical. These results suggest that properties of pseudowords themselves can affect lexical classification and hence spelling. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Sensitivity to speech rhythm, especially the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables, is an important aspect of language acquisition and comprehension from infancy through adulthood. In English, a strong correlation exists between speech rhythm and grammatical class. This property is well illustrated by a particular group of noun/verb homographs that are spelled the same but are pronounced with a lexical stress on the first syllable when used as a noun or on the second syllable when used as a verb. The purpose of this study was to further examine the neural markers of speech rhythm and its role in word recognition. To this end, event-related brain potentials were recorded while participants listened to spoken sentences containing a stress homograph either in a noun or a verb position. The rhythmic structure of the stress homographs was manipulated so that they were pronounced with a stress pattern that either matched or mismatched their grammatical class. Results of cluster-based permutation tests on the event-related brain potentials revealed larger negativities over the centrofrontal scalp regions when the stress homographs were mispronounced, in line with previous studies on lexical ambiguity resolution. In addition, differences between rhythmically unexpected nouns and verbs could be seen as early as 200 ms, suggesting that listeners are sensitive to statistical properties of their language rhythm. Together, these results support the hypothesis that information about speech rhythm is rapidly integrated during speech perception and contributes to lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {Lexical cloning, formally known as ‘contrastive focus reduplication’, refers to the phenomenon whereby there is a modifier reduplication of a lexical item. The reduplicated modifier, which receives a contrastive focus accent, is used to single out some privileged sense, in contrast to other senses, of an ambiguous, polysemous, vague or loose lexical expression (Huang, 2009). Lexical cloning is found in a variety of Englishes including American, Australian, British, Canadian, New Zealand, and South African English, but it is most widely used in American English. It is also a recent phenomenon. Furthermore, the use of lexical clones is largely restricted to a certain, informal conversational register of spoken English. Even the tokens of lexical cloning that are found in written English such as scripts for plays, films and TV programmes are largely representations of spontaneous spoken language (as a mode) in written form (as the medium). In this short paper, improving on Huang (2009), I shall first provide a description of lexical cloning in English. I shall then discuss context-dependency of lexical cloning. Finally, I shall outline a neo-Gricean lexical pragmatic analysis of this novel lexical phenomenon in the language. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We examined code-switching (CS) in the speech of twenty-four bilingual caregivers when speaking with their 18- to 24-month-old children. All parents CS at least once in a short play session, and some code-switched quite often (over 1/3 of utterances). This CS included both inter-sentential and intra-sentential switches, suggesting that at least some children are frequently exposed to mixed-language sentences. However, we found no evidence that this exposure to CS had any detrimental effect on children's word learning: children's overall vocabulary size did not relate to parental inter-sentential CS behavior, and was positively related to within-sentence CS. Parents often repeated words across their two languages, but this did not appear to increase the likelihood of children having translation equivalents in their vocabulary. In short, parents appear to CS fairly often to young children, even within sentences, but there is no evidence that this delays child lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {This study investigated the brain regions for the comprehension of implied emotion in sentences. Participants read negative sentences without negative words, for example, 'The boy fell asleep and never woke up again,' and their neutral counterparts 'The boy stood up and grabbed his bag.' This kind of negative sentence allows us to examine implied emotion derived at the sentence level, without associative emotion coming from word retrieval. We found that implied emotion in sentences, relative to neutral sentences, led to activation in some emotion-related areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the insula, as well as certain languagerelated areas, including the inferior frontal gyrus, which has been implicated in combinatorial processing. These results suggest that the emotional network involved in implied emotion is intricately related to the network for combinatorial processing in language, supporting the view that sentence meaning is more than simply concatenating the meanings of its lexical building blocks.

Abstract = {Background and objectives. Due to the large migrations over the past three decades, large numbers of individuals with schizophrenia are learning a second language and being seen in clinics in that second language. We conducted within-subject comparisons to clarify the contribution of clinical, linguistic and bilingual features in the first and second languages of bilinguals with schizophrenia. Methods. Ten bilingual Russian(L1) and Hebrew(L2) proficient patients, who developed clinical schizophrenia after achieving proficiency in both languages, were selected from 60 candidates referred for the study; they were resident in Israel 7–32 years with 3–10 years from immigration to diagnosis. Clinical, linguistic and fluency markers were coded in transcripts of clinical interviews. Results. There was a trend toward more verbal productivity in the first language (L1) than the second language (L2). Clinical speech markers associated with thought disorder and cognitive impairment (blocking and topic shift) were similar in both languages. Among linguistic markers of schizophrenia, Incomplete syntax and Speech role reference were significantly more frequent in L2 than L1; Lexical repetition and Unclear reference demonstrated a trend in the same direction. For fluency phenomena, Discourse markers were more prevalent in L1 than L2, and Codeswitching was similar across languages, showing that the patients were attuned to the socio-pragmatics of language use. Conclusions. More frequent linguistic markers of schizophrenia in L2 show more impairment in the syntactic/semantic components of language, reflecting greater thought and cognitive dysfunction. Patients are well able to acquire a second language. Nevertheless, schizophrenia finds expression in that language. Finally, more frequent fluency markers in L1 suggests motivation to maintain fluency, evidenced in particular by codeswitched L2 lexical items, a compensatory resource.

Abstract = {Neural representations of words are thought to have a complex spatio-temporal cortical basis. It has been suggested that spoken word recognition is not a process of feed-forward computations from phonetic to lexical forms, but rather involves the online integration of bottom-up input with stored lexical knowledge. Using direct neural recordings from the temporal lobe, we examined cortical responses to words and pseudowords. We found that neural populations were not only sensitive to lexical status (real vs. pseudo), but also to cohort size (number of words matching the phonetic input at each time point) and cohort frequency (lexical frequency of those words). These lexical variables modulated neural activity from the posterior to anterior temporal lobe, and also dynamically as the stimuli unfolded on a millisecond time scale. Our findings indicate that word recognition is not purely modular, but relies on rapid and online integration of multiple sources of lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {This dissertation addresses semantic search of Web services using natural language processing. We first survey various existing approaches, focusing on the fact that the expensive costs of current semantic annotation frameworks result in limited use of semantic search for large scale applications. We then propose a vector space model based service searching framework to combine traditional frequency weighted term-document matrix and syntactical information extracted from a lexical database and a dependency grammar parser. In particular, instead of using terms as the rows in a term-document matrix, we propose using synsets in WordNet to distinguish different meanings of a word under different contexts as well as clustering different words with the similar meaning. Also based on the characteristics of Web services descriptions, we propose an approach to identifying semantically important terms to adjust the weights. Our experiments show that our approach achieves its goal well. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Abstract = {Reports an error in 'Subjective age-of-acquisition norms for 600 Turkish words from four age groups' by İlyas Göz, Ali İ. Tekcan and Aslı Aktan Erciyes (Behavior Research Methods, 2017[Oct], Vol 49[5], 1736-1746). In the original article, there were errors in Table 1 and the calculations of r value. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2017-45571-014[/rid]). The main purpose of this study was to report age-based subjective age-of-acquisition (AoA) norms for 600 Turkish words. A total of 115 children, 100 young adults, 115 middle-aged adults, and 127 older adults provided AoA estimates for 600 words on a 7-point scale. The intraclass correlations suggested high reliability, and the AoA estimates were highly correlated across the four age groups. Children gave earlier AoA estimates than the three adult groups; this was true for high-frequency as well as low-frequency words. In addition to the means and standard deviations of the AoA estimates, we report word frequency, concreteness, and imageability ratings, as well as word length measures (numbers of syllables and letters), for the 600 words as supplemental materials. The present ratings represent a potentially useful database for researchers working on lexical processing as well as other aspects of cognitive processing, such as autobiographical memory.

Abstract = {English, German, and Dutch show very similar word stress patterns, in that word stress is not fixed to a certain position within a word, but realized within the final three syllables. There is, however, no consensus on the actual stress-assigning algorithms and the role of quantity (e.g., Kiparsky ; Wiese ; Hayes ; Giegerich , ; Trommelen and Zonneveld , ). Existing studies are methodologically problematic since they largely depend on convenience samples of existing words and do not test their claims with new words. Using mixed effects regression and classification trees as analytical tools, this paper presents the results of a production experiment with pseudowords and an analysis of large random samples as found in the CELEX lexical database. It is shown that stress assignment is sensitive to syllabic weight in all three languages, though in slightly different ways. The implications of these results for the metrical structure of the three languages are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTH)},

Abstract = {The Chinese language has more native speakers than any other language, but research on the reading of Chinese characters is still not as well-developed as it is for the reading of words in alphabetic languages. Two areas notably lacking are the paucity of megastudies in Chinese and the relatively infrequent use of the lexical decision paradigm to investigate single-character recognition. The Chinese Lexicon Project, described in this article, is a database of lexical decision latencies for 2,500 Chinese single characters in simplified script, collected from a sample of native mainland Chinese (Mandarin) speakers ( N = 35). This resource will provide a valuable adjunct to influential mega-databases, such as the English, French, and Dutch Lexicon Projects. Using two separate analyses, some advantages associated with megastudies are exemplified. These include the selection of the strongest measure to represent Chinese character frequency (Cai & Brysbaert's (PLoS ONE 5(6): e10729, ) subti)},

Abstract = {Independent measures of age of acquisition (AoA), name agreement, and rated object familiarity were obtained from groups of British subjects for all items in the Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) picture set with single names. Word frequency measures, both written and spoken, were taken from the Celex database (Centre for Lexical Information, 1993). The line drawings were presented to a separate groupof participants in an object naming task, and vocal naming latencies were recorded. A subset of 195 items was selected for analysis after excluding items with, for example, low name agreement. The major determinants of picture naming speed were the frequency of the name, the interaction between AoA and frequency, and name agreement. (The main effect of the AoA of the name and the effect of the rated image agreement of the picture were also significant on one-tailed tests.) Spoken name frequency affects object naming times mainly for items with later-acquired names. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR], C)},

Therefore, this research contributes to the frame of the Natural Semantic Metalanguage Research Programme (NSMRP) by applying it to the study of a historical language. Throughout such an application several descriptive and methodological questions arise. On the descriptive side, it is necessary to propose a cluster of semantic, morphological, textual and syntactic criteria that allow for the identification of the prime at stake, given that the nature of the object of study is not compatible with the translation into the native language generally adopted by the NSMRP.

Abstract = {The objective of our study is to introduce a fully automated, computational linguistic technique to quantify semantic relations between words generated on a standard semantic verbal fluency test and to determine its cognitive and clinical correlates. Cognitive differences between patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment are evident in their performance on the semantic verbal fluency test. In addition to the semantic verbal fluency test score, several other performance characteristics sensitive to disease status and predictive of future cognitive decline have been defined in terms of words generated from semantically related categories (clustering) and shifting between categories (switching). However, the traditional assessment of clustering and switching has been performed manually in a qualitative fashion resulting in subjective scoring with limited reproducibility and scalability. Our approach uses word definitions and hierarchical relations between the words in WordNet[R], a large electronic lexical database, to quantify the degree of semantic similarity and relatedness between words. We investigated the novel semantic fluency indices of mean cumulative similarity and relatedness between all pairs of words regardless of their order, and mean sequential similarity and relatedness between pairs of adjacent words in a sample of patients with clinically diagnosed probable (n=55) or possible (n=27) Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment (n=31). The semantic fluency indices differed significantly between the diagnostic groups, and were strongly associated with neuropsychological tests of executive function, as well as the rate of global cognitive decline. Our results suggest that word meanings and relations between words shared across individuals and computationally modeled via WordNet and large text corpora provide the necessary context to account for the variability in language-based behavior and relate it to cognitive dysfunction observed in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

Existing methods for computing sentence similarity have been adopted from approaches used for long text documents. These methods process sentences in a very high-dimensional space and are consequently inefficient, require human input, and are not adaptable to some application domains. This paper focuses directly on computing the similarity between very short texts of sentence length. It presents an algorithm that takes account of semantic information and word order information implied in the sentences. The semantic similarity of two sentences is calculated using information from a structured lexical database and from corpus statistics.

Abstract = {Gestures and speech combinations have a crucial role on early lexical and syntactic development. Nonetheless, little is known about the role of these combinations on language learning beyond the two-word stage. Our aim is to explore how children combine gestures and speech when they start to master syntactic rules. Thirty Spanish children (aged 24–35 months) participated in a task with a 'find the odd one' game structure. The complexity of the target picture increased in terms of the relationships between the elements depicted in each image. Children coordinate gestures and words preferably as their main communicative resource, regardless the complexity of the message to convey or their linguistic development. They distribute the semantic load between speech and gesture depending on message complexity. Among all types of gesture–speech combinations produced, reinforcing combinations were related to lexical and syntactic development, and supplementary combinations were related to lexical development.

Abstract = {The present study explores the distributional features of two important effects within the picture–word interference paradigm: the semantic interference and the distractor frequency effects. These two effects display different and specific distributional profiles. Semantic interference appears greatly reduced in faster response times, while it reaches its full magnitude only in slower responses. This can be interpreted as a sign of fluctuant attentional efficiency in resolving response conflict. In contrast, the distractor frequency effect is mediated mainly by a distributional shift, with low-frequency distractors uniformly shifting reaction time distribution towards a slower range of latencies. This finding fits with the idea that distractor frequency exerts its effect by modulating the point in time in which operations required to discard the distractor can start. Taken together, these results are congruent with current theoretical accounts of both the semantic interference and distractor frequency effects. Critically, distributional analyses highlight and further describe the different cognitive dynamics underlying these two effects, suggesting that this analytical tool is able to offer important insights about lexical access during speech production.

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the developmental changes in a group of normally developing children (aged 8–12) and adolescents (aged 13–16) during semantic processing. We manipulated association strength (i.e. a global reading unit) and semantic radical (i.e. a local reading unit) to explore the interaction of lexical and sublexical semantic information in making semantic judgments. In the semantic judgment task, two types of stimuli were used: visually-similar (i.e. shared a semantic radical) versus visually-dissimilar (i.e. did not share a semantic radical) character pairs. Participants were asked to indicate if two Chinese characters, arranged according to association strength, were related in meaning. The results showed greater developmental increases in activation in left angular gyrus (BA 39) in the visually-similar compared to the visually-dissimilar pairs for the strong association. There were also greater age-related increases in angular gyrus for the strong compared to weak association in the visually-similar pairs. Both of these results suggest that shared semantics at the sublexical level facilitates the integration of overlapping features at the lexical level in older children. In addition, there was a larger developmental increase in left posterior middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) for the weak compared to strong association in the visually-dissimilar pairs, suggesting conflicting sublexical information placed greater demands on access to lexical representations in the older children. All together, these results suggest that older children are more sensitive to sublexical information when processing lexical representations.

Abstract = {The present study asked whether or not the apparent insensitivity of second language (L2) learners to grammatical gender violations reflects an inability to use grammatical information during L2 lexical processing. Native German speakers and English speakers with intermediate to advanced L2 proficiency in German performed a translation-recognition task. On critical trials, an incorrect translation was presented that either matched or mismatched the grammatical gender of the correct translation. Results show interference for native German speakers in conditions in which the incorrect translation matched the gender of the correct translation. Native English speakers, regardless of German proficiency, were insensitive to the gender mismatch. In contrast, these same participants were correctly able to assign gender to critical items. These findings suggest a dissociation between explicit knowledge and the ability to use that information under speeded processing conditions and demonstrate the difficulty of L2 gender processing at the lexical level.

Abstract = {A standard view of language processing holds that lexical forms are arbitrary, and that non-arbitrary relationships between meaning and form such as onomatopoeias are unusual cases with little relevance to language processing in general. Here we capitalize on the greater availability of iconic lexical forms in a signed language (British Sign Language, BSL), to test how iconic relationships between meaning and form affect lexical processing. In three experiments, we found that iconicity in BSL facilitated picture–sign matching, phonological decision, and picture naming. In comprehension the effect of iconicity did not interact with other factors, but in production it was observed only for later-learned signs. These findings suggest that iconicity serves to activate conceptual features related to perception and action during lexical processing. We suggest that the same should be true for iconicity in spoken languages (e.g., onomatopoeias), and discuss the implications this has for general theories of lexical processing.

Abstract = {In research on the role of lexical predictability in language comprehension, predictability is generally defined as the probability that a word is provided as a sentence continuation in the cloze task (Taylor, 1953), in which subjects are asked to guess the next word of a sentence. The present experiments investigate the process by which subjects generate a cloze response, by measuring the latency to initiate a response in a version of the task in which subjects produce a spoken continuation to a visually presented sentence fragment. Higher probability responses were produced faster than lower probability responses. The latency to produce a response was also influenced by item constraint: A response at a given level of probability was issued faster when the context was more constraining, i.e., a single response was elicited with high probability. We show that these patterns are naturally produced by an activation-based race model in which potential responses independently race towards a response threshold. Implications for the interpretation of cloze probability as a measure of lexical predictability are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two priming experiments examined the separate contribution of lexical tone and segmental information in the processing of spoken words in Mandarin Chinese. Experiment 1 contrasted four types of prime–target pairs: tone-and-segment overlap (ru4-ru4), segment-only overlap (ru3-ru4), tone-only overlap (sha4-ru4) and unrelated (qin1-ru4) in an auditory lexical decision task with 48 native Mandarin listeners. Experiment 2 further investigated the minimal segmental overlap needed to trigger priming when tonal information is present. Four prime–target conditions were contrasted: tone-and-segment overlap (ru4-ru4), only onset segment overlap (re4-ru4), only rime overlap (pu4-ru4) and unrelated (qin1-ru4) in an auditory lexical decision task with 68 native Mandarin listeners. The results showed significant priming effects when both tonal and segmental information overlapped or, although to a lesser extent, when only segmental information overlapped, with no priming found when only tones matched. Moreover, any partial segmental overlap, even with matching tonal cues, resulted in significant inhibition. These data clearly indicate that lexical tones are processed differently from segments, with syllabic structure playing a critical role. These findings are discussed in terms of the overall architecture of the processing system that emerges in Mandarin lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Speech contains temporal structure that the brain must analyze to enable linguistic processing. To investigate the neural basis of this analysis, we used sound quilts, stimuli constructed by shuffling segments of a natural sound, approximately preserving its properties on short timescales while disrupting them on longer scales. We generated quilts from foreign speech to eliminate language cues and manipulated the extent of natural acoustic structure by varying the segment length. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified bilateral regions of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) whose responses varied with segment length. This effect was absent in primary auditory cortex and did not occur for quilts made from other natural sounds or acoustically matched synthetic sounds, suggesting tuning to speech-specific spectrotemporal structure. When examined parametrically, the STS response increased with segment length up to ~500 ms. Our results identify a locus of speech analysis in human auditory cortex that is distinct from lexical, semantic or syntactic processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Using a novel all-nonword task ('Does the target have more vowels than consonants?'), new evidence is provided showing that processing fluency can bias masked priming of binary judgments. Two experiments revealed masked repetition priming for 'yes' nonwords (e.g., NUISO) but not for 'no' nonwords (e.g., RULON). This pattern is considered evidence that the greater ease of target processing induced by repetition primes was attributed to the target being a member of the response category associated with shorter RTs, namely the 'yes' response category. This pattern of nonword priming effects reinforces Bodner and Masson’s (1997) key claims: (a) a fluency-attribution process can influence masked priming, and (b) therefore, the masked-priming paradigm does not isolate lexical processes.

Abstract = {Aspectual notions, although displayed most clearly in verbs, manifest across categories, with notions like (un)boundedness manifesting themselves in several instantiations which are sometimes specific of individual grammatical categories. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on how aspectual notions emerge in different categorial domains by an analysis of subject-experiencer and object-experiencer psychological predicates (SEPVs and OEPVs, respectively). We review the evidence that SEPVs denote individual level (IL) states, and provide new facts – taken from the behaviour of participles – in favour of that diagnostic; we also argue that OEPVs should be classified as states of the stage level (SL) class. We argue that OEPVs denote states with an onset, which corresponds to the denotation of SLs. SEPVs simply denote states without boundaries, which we argue to correspond to IL predicates. Finally, we show how these two denotations follow without further assumptions from the structures proposed for SEPVs and OEPVs in previous work, specially Pesetsky (1995), making it unnecessary to postulate that the distinction is of lexical nature.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to generalize the positive impact of auditory-visual bimodality on lexical retrieval in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. In practice, the naming skills of healthy elderly persons improve when additional sensory signals are included. The hypothesis of this study was that the same influence would be observable in AD patients. Sixty elderly patients separated into three groups (healthy subjects, stage 1 AD patients, and stage 2 AD patients) were tested with a battery of naming tasks comprising three different modalities: a visual modality, an auditory modality, and a visual and auditory modality (bimodality). Our results reveal the positive influence of bimodality on the accuracy with which bimodal items are named (when compared with unimodal items) and their latency (when compared with unimodal auditory items). These results suggest that multisensory enrichment can improve lexical retrieval in AD patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this paper we report a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that tested contrasting predictions about the time course of cognitive control in second language (L2) acquisition. We examined the neural correlates of lexical processing in L2 learners twice over the course of one academic year. Specifically, while in the scanner, participants were asked to judge the language membership of unambiguous first and second language words, as well as interlingual homographs. Our ROI and connectivity analyses reveal that with increased exposure to the L2, overall activation in control areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex decrease while connectivity with semantic processing regions such as the middle temporal gyrus increase. These results suggest that cognitive control is more important initially in L2 acquisition, and have significant implications for understanding developmental and neurocognitive models of second language lexical processing.

Abstract = {The argument structure complexity hypothesis (Thompson, 2003) was introduced to account for the verb production pattern of agrammatic patients, who show greater difficulty in producing transitive versus unergative verbs (argument number effect) and in producing unaccusative versus unergative verbs (syntactic movement effect). The present study investigates these two effects in the reading performance of a patient (GR) suffering from deep dyslexia. GR read nouns significantly better than verbs; moreover, her performance was better on unergative than on transitive verbs, whereas the comparison between unergative and unaccusative verbs did not differ significantly. Data support the extension of the argument structure complexity hypothesis to word naming and suggest that the two aspects of argument structure complexity occur at different levels within models of lexical processing.

Abstract = {In each semantic domain studied to date, there is considerable variation in how meanings are expressed across languages. But are some semantic domains more likely to show variation than others? Is the domain of space more or less variable in its expression than other semantic domains, such as containers, body parts, or colours? According to many linguists, the meanings expressed in grammaticised expressions, such as (spatial) adpositions, are more likely to be similar across languages than meanings expressed in open class lexical items. On the other hand, some psychologists predict there ought to be more variation across languages in the meanings of adpositions, than in the meanings of nouns. This is because relational categories, such as those expressed as adpositions, are said to be constructed by language; whereas object categories expressed as nouns are predicted to be 'given by the world'. We tested these hypotheses by comparing the semantic systems of closely related languages. Previous cross-linguistic studies emphasise the importance of studying diverse languages, but we argue that a focus on closely related languages is advantageous because domains can be compared in a culturally- and historically-informed manner. Thus we collected data from 12 Germanic languages. Naming data were collected from at least 20 speakers of each language for containers, body-parts, colours, and spatial relations. We found the semantic domains of colour and body-parts were the most similar across languages. Containers showed some variation, but spatial relations expressed in adpositions showed the most variation. The results are inconsistent with the view expressed by most linguists. Instead, we find meanings expressed in grammaticised meanings are more variable than meanings in open class lexical items. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Researchers have extensively documented how various statistical properties of words (e.g., word frequency) influence lexical processing. However, the impact of lexical variables on nonword decision-making performance is less clear. This gap is surprising, because a better specification of the mechanisms driving nonword responses may provide valuable insights into early lexical processes. In the present study, item-level and participant-level analyses were conducted on the trial-level lexical decision data for almost 37,000 nonwords in the English Lexicon Project in order to identify the influence of different psycholinguistic variables on nonword lexical decision performance and to explore individual differences in how participants respond to nonwords. Item-level regression analyses reveal that nonword response time was positively correlated with number of letters, number of orthographic neighbors, number of affixes, and base-word number of syllables, and negatively correlated with Levenshtein orthographic distance and base-word frequency. Participant-level analyses also point to within- and between-session stability in nonword responses across distinct sets of items, and intriguingly reveal that higher vocabulary knowledge is associated with less sensitivity to some dimensions (e.g., number of letters) but more sensitivity to others (e.g., base-word frequency). The present findings provide well-specified and interesting new constraints for informing models of word recognition and lexical decision.

Abstract = {In bilingual processing, cognates are associated with facilitatory processing, while switching between languages is associated with a processing cost. This study investigates whether co-activation of cognates affects the magnitude of switch costs in sentence context. A shadowing task was conducted to examine whether verb cognates reduce switch costs in sentences that switched between participants' L1 and L2. In addition, we considered whether these effects were influenced by L2 proficiency, switching direction and cross-linguistic overlap in syntactic structure. Bilinguals were presented with L1 and L2 sentences that contained a language switch preceded by a cognate. Shadowing latencies showed that switching to L2 was more costly than switching to L1. Switch costs in both directions were not modulated by the presence of a verb cognate, and this effect was not affected by syntactic structure or L2 proficiency. The results are informative for the field of bilingual processing and the lexical trigger hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study investigated second language (L2) lexical development in the spontaneous speech of six adult, L2 English learners in a 1-year longitudinal study. One important aspect of lexical development is lexical organization and depth of knowledge. Hypernymic relations, the hierarchical relationships among related words that vary in relation to their semantic specificity (e.g., Golden Retriever vs. dog vs. animal), are an important indicator of both lexical organization and depth of knowledge. Thus, this study used hypernymy values from the WordNet database and a lexical diversity measure to analyze lexical development. Statistical analyses in this study indicated that both hypernymic relations and lexical diversity in L2 learners increase over time. Additionally, lexical diversity and hypernymic values correlated significantly, suggesting that as learners’ lexicons grow, learners have access to a wider range of hypernymy levels. These findings are discussed in relation to developing abstractness in language, extending hypernymic knowledge, and the growth of lexical networks.

Participants wrote down picture names in a picture-naming task in Experiment 1or response words in a symbol—word associative writing task in Experiment 2. A sublexical phonological property of picture names (phonetic regularity: regular vs. irregular) in Experiment 1and a lexical phonological property of response words (homophone density: dense vs. sparse) in Experiment 2, as well as word frequency of the targets in both experiments, were manipulated. A facilitatory effect of word frequency was found in both experiments, in which words with high frequency were produced faster than those with low frequency. More importantly, we observed an inhibitory phonetic regularity effect, in which low-frequency picture names with regular first characters were slower to write than those with irregular ones, and an inhibitory homophone density effect, in which characters with dense homophone density were produced more slowly than those with sparse homophone density. Results suggested that phonological codes constrained handwritten production via lexical and sublexical routes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two experiments investigated the lexical inhibitory effect of orthographic neighbors relative to identity priming effects in an unmasked priming paradigm combined with a lexical decision task on word targets. Targets were preceded either by the same word, by a lower frequency orthographic word neighbor, by an orthographic pseudoword neighbor or by an unrelated prime. Experiment 1 showed a standard facilitatory effect from identity primes, whereas inhibitory priming effects were observed for both types of neighbor primes. Experiment 2 examined the time-course of these effects by using event-related potential recordings. A generalized relatedness effect was found in the 200–400 ms time-window, with smaller negativities generated by related primes than unrelated primes regardless of prime type. In contrast, at 400ms, while identity primes were associated with smaller negativities than unrelated primes, word neighbor primes were associated with greater negativities than unrelated primes. Additionally, pseudoword neighbor primes produce null effects as compared to unrelated primes. These results are discussed in terms of competition between activated lexical representations and revealed that such a mechanism is modulated by the lexical status of the prime.

While the identification functions showed similar steepness and boundary location between the two subject groups, the discrimination results revealed superior performance in the musicians for discriminating within-category stimuli pairs but not for between-category stimuli. These findings suggest that musical training can enhance sensitivity to subtle pitch differences between within-category sounds in the presence of robust mental representations in service of CP of lexical tonal contrasts.

Abstract = {French-learning infants have language-specific difficulties in processing lexical stress due to the lack of lexical stress in French. These difficulties in discriminating between words with stress-initial (trochaic) and stress-final (iambic) patterns emerge by 10 months of age in the easier context of low variability (using a single item pronounced with a trochaic pattern vs. an iambic pattern) as well as in the more challenging context of high segmental variability (using lists of segmentally different trochaic and iambic items). These findings raise the question of stress pattern perception in simultaneous bilinguals learning French and a second language using stress at the lexical level. Bijeljac-Babic, Serres, Höhle, and Nazzi (2012) established that at 10 months of age, in the simpler context of low variability, such bilinguals have better stress discrimination abilities than French-learning monolinguals. The current study explored whether this advantage extends to the more challenging context of high segmental variability. Results first establish stress pattern discrimination in a group of bilingual 10-month-olds learning French and one language with (variable) lexical stress, but not in French-learning 10-month-old monolinguals. Second, discrimination in bilinguals appeared not to be affected by the language balance of the infants, suggesting that sensitivity to stress patterns might be maintained in these bilingual infants provided that they hear at least 30% of a language with lexical stress.

Abstract = {While research suggests that study abroad (SA) benefits second language (L2) oral fluency, its benefits for other domains are less clear, especially for shorterterm programs, which are becoming more common. Additionally, studies investigating the relationship between cognitive capacity and benefits of SA report inconsistent patterns. In light of these gaps, this study investigated whether a 5‐week intensive language experience abroad benefits L2 lexical and grammatical development and whether development is related to learners' cognitive capacity. Twenty‐six L1 English–advanced L2 Spanish participants in a SA program in Spain completed pre‐/post‐SA grammaticality judgment (GJT) and lexical decision tasks (LDT). On the GJT, results showed higher accuracy and decreasing reaction times (RTs); specifically, accuracy increased on word order and number agreement items but not on gender agreement. RTs did not decrease for any of the three targets individually. For the LDT, performance on nonwords, but not words, showed improvement while RTs for both words and nonwords decreased. Overall, these gains following short‐term experience abroad were independent of variation in cognitive capacity. This study makes a unique contribution toward understanding the roles of L2 proficiency, context, and individual differences in morphosyntactic and lexical development.

Abstract = {Previous studies using direct forms of vocabulary instruction have shown that newly learned words are integrated with existing lexical knowledge only after off-line consolidation (as measured by competition between new and existing words during spoken word recognition). However, the bulk of vocabulary acquisition during childhood occurs through incidental exposure to verbal material; hence, the role of consolidation may be different or limited when learning is less explicit. To address this, 40 children (ages 7–10 years) and 33 adults listened to a fictitious story that contained 12 novel words (e.g., 'daffodat'). Lexical integration was measured by comparing pause detection latencies to existing competitors (e.g., 'daffo_dil') and control words for which no new competitor had been encountered. Pause detection latencies were slower for existing competitors than control words (signifying increased lexical competition) 24 hr after exposure to the novel words but not immediately. Both groups recalled significantly more novel words when tested 24 hr after hearing the story than immediately. It is important that children with better expressive vocabulary knowledge showed larger consolidation effects for the novel words, both in terms of strengthening of explicit knowledge and their integration with existing knowledge. Off-line consolidation is therefore required for the integration of new and established knowledge when words are learned under relatively naturalistic conditions. Furthermore, a richer body of established vocabulary knowledge may facilitate (or benefit from) swift lexical integration of new vocabulary.

Abstract = {This paper predicts the mutual intelligibility of 15 Chinese dialects from multiple objective distance measures. Empirical mutual intelligibility measures were obtained from functional intelligibility tests at the sentence level from 15 listeners for each of 15 Chinese dialects. We computed various proximity measures on the basis of shared phonemes and tones in the sound inventories of the 15 dialects. Next, Levenshtein (string-edit) distance measures were computed on the 764 common syllabic units (zi in Pinyin, i.e., a meaningful character or morpheme with a complete transcription of segments and tone) shared by the same 15 Chinese dialects in the Dialect Sound Database of Modern Chinese (compiled by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences). Unweighted and perceptually weighted Levenshtein distance measures were computed. We also included objective similarity measures of phonological correspondence, based on the Zihui character list and of lexical affinity, based on the Cihui cross-dialect lexical database with all cognate and non-cognate expressions of 905 core concepts) that have been published by Cheng (1997). The best single predictor of mutual intelligibility between a pair of dialects was the percentage of cognates shared between them (r² = .548). Including all predictors afforded a highly accurate prediction of mutual intelligibility (R² = .874). A very reasonable prediction is afforded if we just add the lexical frequency of finals (syllable rhymes) shared by a pair of dialects (R² = .611).

Abstract = {Category ambiguous words (like hug and swing) have the potential to complicate both learning and processing of language. However, uses of such words may be disambiguated by acoustic differences that depend on the category of use. This article uses an event-related potential (ERP) technique to ask whether adult native speakers of English show neural sensitivity to those differences. The results indicate that noun and verb tokens of ambiguous words produce differences in the amplitude of the ERP response over left anterior sites as early as 100ms following stimulus onset and persisting for over 400ms. Nonsense words extracted from noun and verb contexts do not show such differences. These findings suggest that the acoustic differences between noun and verb tokens of ambiguous words are perceived and processed by adults and may be part of the lexical representation of the word.

Abstract = {Previous studies suggested that the emotional connotation of single words automatically recruits attention. We investigated the potential of words to induce emotional engagement when reading texts. In an fMRI experiment, we presented 120 text passages from the Harry Potter book series. Results showed significant correlations between affective word (lexical) ratings and passage ratings. Furthermore, affective lexical ratings correlated with activity in regions associated with emotion, situation model building, multi-modal semantic integration, and Theory of Mind. We distinguished differential influences of affective lexical, inter-lexical, and supra-lexical variables: differential effects of lexical valence were significant in the left amygdala, while effects of arousal-span (the dynamic range of arousal across a passage) were significant in the left amygdala and insula. However, we found no differential effect of passage ratings in emotion-associated regions. Our results support the hypothesis that the emotion potential of short texts can be predicted by lexical and inter-lexical affective variables.

Abstract = {Monolingual infants are typically studied as a homogenous group and compared to bilingual infants. This study looks further into two subgroups of monolingual infants, monodialectal and multidialectal, to identify the effects of dialect-related variation on the phonological representation of words. Using an Intermodal Preferential Looking task, the detection of mispronunciations in familiar words was compared in infants aged 1;8 exposed to consistent (monodialectal) or variable (multidialectal) pronunciations of words in their daily input. Only monodialectal infants detected the mispronunciations whereas multidialectal infants looked longer at the target following naming whether the label was correctly produced or not. This suggests that variable phonological input in the form of dialect variation impacts the degree of specificity of lexical representations in early infancy.

Abstract = {Readers may use contextual information to anticipate and pre-activate specific lexical items during reading. However, prior studies have not clearly dissociated the effects of accurate lexical prediction from other forms of contextual facilitation such as plausibility or semantic priming. In this study, we measured electrophysiological responses to predicted and unpredicted target words in passages providing varying levels of contextual support. This method was used to isolate the neural effects of prediction from other potential contextual influences on lexical processing. While both prediction and discourse context influenced ERP amplitudes within the time range of the N400, the effects of prediction occurred much more rapidly, preceding contextual facilitation by approximately 100ms. In addition, a frontal, post-N400 positivity (PNP) was modulated by both prediction accuracy and the overall plausibility of the preceding passage. These results suggest a unique temporal primacy for prediction in facilitating lexical access. They also suggest that the frontal PNP may index the costs of revising discourse representations following an incorrect lexical prediction.

Abstract = {Metaphorical expressions very often involve words referring to physical entities and experiences. Yet, figures of speech such as metaphors are not intended to be understood literally, word-by-word. We used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to determine whether metaphorical expressions are processed more like physical or more like abstract expressions. To this end, novel adjective-noun word pairs were presented visually in three conditions: (1) Physical, easy to experience with the senses (e.g., 'printed schedule'); (2) Abstract, difficult to experience with the senses (e.g., 'conditional schedule'); and (3) novel Metaphorical, expressions with a physical adjective, but a figurative meaning (e.g., 'thin schedule').We replicated the N400 lexical concreteness effect for concrete vs. abstract adjectives. In order to increase the sensitivity of the concreteness manipulation on the expressions, we divided each condition into high and low groups according to rated concreteness. Mirroring the adjective result, we observed a N400 concreteness effect at the noun for physical expressions with high concreteness ratings vs. abstract expressions with low concreteness ratings, even though the nouns per se did not differ in lexical concreteness. Paradoxically, the N400 to nouns in the metaphorical expressions was indistinguishable from that to nouns in the literal abstract expressions, but only for the more concrete subgroup of metaphors; the N400 to the less concrete subgroup of metaphors patterned with that to nouns in the literal concrete expressions. In sum, we not only find evidence for conceptual concreteness separable from lexical concreteness but also that the processing of metaphorical expressions is not driven strictly by either lexical or conceptual concreteness.

Abstract = {We examined the hypothesis that encoding Chinese characters through stroke-by-stroke animation produces orthographic learning that is different from conventional static displays. We used behavioral responses and ERPs to index the incremental learning that occurs of character forms, and the attention allocation to dynamic vs. static encodings. Adult, native English speakers learned form-meaning associations for characters displayed either statically or dynamically while ERPs were recorded. During learning, in both conditions, the P600 component decreased over exposures, indexing incremental and episodic learning of characters. Moreover, dynamic displays, relative to static displays, produced a larger P300, indexing attention-based updating of orthographic representations. Furthermore, the P300 predicted retention for dynamically encoded characters. On a form-meaning judgment task immediately following learning, an incongruity N400 effect was found for only the statically-encoded characters, although behavioral accuracy was similar across conditions. Our findings suggest multiple pathways to orthographic learning that result in trade-offs in learning form and meaning lexical constituents.

Abstract = {Despite a century of research into visual word recognition, basic questions remain unresolved about the functional architecture of the process that maps visual inputs from orthographic analysis onto lexical form and meaning and about the units of analysis in terms of which these processes are conducted. Here we use magnetoencephalography, supported by a masked priming behavioral study, to address these questions using contrasting sets of simple (walk), complex (swimmer), and pseudo-complex (corner) forms. Early analyses of orthographic structure, detectable in bilateral posterior temporal regions within a 150–230msec time frame, are shown to segment the visual input into linguistic substrings (words and morphemes) that trigger lexical access in left middle temporal locations from 300 msec. These are primarily feedforward processes and are not initially constrained by lexical-level variables. Lexical constraints become significant from 390 msec, in both simple and complex words, with increased processing of pseudowords and pseudo-complex forms. These results, consistent with morpho-orthographic models based on masked priming data, map out the real-time functional architecture of visual word recognition, establishing basic feedforward processing relationships between orthographic form, morphological structure, and lexical meaning.

Abstract = {Visual imagery during sleep has long been a topic of persistent speculation, but its private nature has hampered objective analysis. Here we present a neural decoding approach in which machine-learning models predict the contents of visual imagery during the sleep-onset period, given measured brain activity, by discovering links between human functional magnetic resonance imaging patterns and verbal reports with the assistance of lexical and image databases. Decoding models trained on stimulus-induced brain activity in visual cortical areas showed accurate classification, detection, and identification of contents. Our findings demonstrate that specific visual experience during sleep is represented by brain activity patterns shared by stimulus perception, providing a means to uncover subjective contents of dreaming using objective neural measurement.

Abstract = {We report work on adding semantic role labels to the Chinese Treebank, a corpus already annotated with phrase structures. The work involves locating all verbs and their nominalizations in the corpus, and semi-automatically adding semantic role labels to their arguments, which are constituents in a parse tree. Although the same procedure is followed, different issues arise in the annotation of verbs and nominalized predicates. For verbs, identifying their arguments is generally straightforward given their syntactic structure in the Chinese Treebank as they tend to occupy well-defined syntactic positions. Our discussion focuses on the syntactic variations in the realization of the arguments as well as our approach to annotating dislocated and discontinuous arguments. In comparison, identifying the arguments for nominalized predicates is more challenging and we discuss criteria and procedures for distinguishing arguments from non-arguments. In particular we focus on the role of support verbs as well as the relevance of event/result distinctions in the annotation of the predicate-argument structure of nominalized predicates. We also present our approach to taking advantage of the syntactic structure in the Chinese Treebank to bootstrap the predicate-argument structure annotation of verbs. Finally, we discuss the creation of a lexical database of frame files and its role in guiding predicate argument annotation. Procedures for ensuring annotation consistency and inter-annotator agreement evaluation results are also presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This paper reveals that lexical entrainment, in which a person tends to change her verbal expressions to match those said by her addressee, occurs in interactions between people and a robot when they refer to an object in a shared physical space. Many studies argue that lexical entrainment is crucial for understanding the principle of human dialogue and the development of the natural language interfaces of artificial media. However, few studies of it exist in human robot interaction in which humans and robot share a physical space. If lexical entrainment occurs in situations where a physical space is shared with a robot, such findings will contribute to the development of natural language interfaces with social robots. We designed experimental tests in which participants refer to an object and a robot confirms it and measured the extent to which the participants repeated the same verbal expressions said by the robot. Our subjects tended to adopt both the same verbal expressions and lexical categories as the robot. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

In this study we examined a patient presenting a morphological overregularization strategy in a verb generation task during awake surgery. This specific language deficit coincided with brain tumor resection at the level of the left FAT. During the task execution the patient formed the non-existent verbs by applying a morphological derivation rule to the given nouns, instead of retrieving the appropriate verbs. DTI results confirmed left FAT damage. Neuropsychological follow-up showed that this morphological derivation impairment partially persisted after surgery, whereas the results on a wide spectrum of other language-related tasks remained satisfactory. Additionally, we compared the pre- and the post-operational fMRI activation maps for the same verb generation task. We discuss the potential role of the left FAT in the morphological derivation process and in lexical retrieval. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Lexical alignment refers to the adoption of one’s interlocutor’s lexical items. Accounts of the mechanisms underlying such lexical alignment differ (among other aspects) in the role assigned to addressee-centered behavior. In this study, we used a triadic communicative situation to test which factors may modulate the extent to which participants’ lexical alignment reflects addressee-centered behavior. Pairs of naïve participants played a picture matching game and received information about the order in which pictures were to be matched from a voice over headphones. On critical trials, participants did or did not hear a name for the picture to be matched next over headphones. Importantly, when the voice over headphones provided a name, it did not match the name that the interlocutor had previously used to describe the object. Participants overwhelmingly used the word that the voice over headphones provided.This result points to non-addressee-centered behavior and is discussed in terms of disrupting alignment with the interlocutor as well as in terms of establishing alignment with the voice over headphones. In addition, the type of picture (line drawing vs. tangram shape) independently modulated lexical alignment, such that participants showed more lexical alignment to their interlocutor for (more ambiguous) tangram shapes compared to line drawings. Overall, the results point to a rather large role for non-addressee-centered behavior during lexical alignment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that the presentation of a printed word 'automatically' triggers processing that ends with full semantic activation. This processing, among other characteristics, is held to occur without intention, and cannot be stopped. The results of the present experiment show that this account is problematic in the context of a variant of the Stroop paradigm. Subjects named the print color of words that were either neutral or semantically related to color. When the letters were all colored, all spatially cued, and the spaces between letters were filled with characters from the top of the keyboard (i.e., 4, #, 5, %, 6, and ∗), color naming yielded a semantically based Stroop effect and a semantically based negative priming effect. In contrast, the same items yielded neither a semantic Stroop effect nor a negative priming effect when a single target letter was uniquely colored and spatially cued. These findings (a) undermine the widespread view that lexical-semantic activation in word reading is automatic in the sense that it occurs without intention and cannot be derailed, and (b) strengthens the case that both implicit and explicit forms of visual word recognition require spatial attention as a necessary preliminary to lexical-semantic processing.

Abstract = {We investigated the role of the syllable during speech processing in German, in an auditory-auditory fragment priming study with lexical decision and simultaneous EEG registration. Spoken fragment primes either shared segments (related) with the spoken targets or not (unrelated), and this segmental overlap either corresponded to the first syllable of the target (e.g., /teis/—/teisti/), or not (e.g., /teis/—/teistl@s/). Similar prime conditions applied for word and pseudoword targets. Lexical decision latencies revealed facilitation due to related fragments that corresponded to the first syllable of the target (/teis/—/teisti/). Despite segmental overlap, there were no positive effects for related fragments that mismatched the first syllable. No facilitation was observed for pseudowords. The EEG analyses showed a consistent effect of relatedness, independent of syllabic match, from 200 to 500 ms, including the P350 and N400 windows. Moreover, this held for words and pseudowords that differed however in the N400 window. The only specific effect of syllabic match for related prime—target pairs was observed in the time window from 200 to 300 ms. We discuss the nature and potential origin of these effects, and their relevance for speech processing and lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This dissertation presents a series of studies examining the structure and meaning of compounds, such as mouse-trap and  mouse-catcher, in child and adult grammars. The first part of this dissertation examines how adults interpret compounds and the second part examines how children acquire the adult compounding system. The goals are (i) to argue that a generative lexical semantics is necessary to understand how speakers use compounds and (ii) to argue that children use the same generative mechanism as adults to build compound interpretations. In the first part of this dissertation two adult studies examine the role of a generative syntax and a generative lexical semantics (Pustejovsky 1995) in the interpretation of compounds. The first study asks adults to interpret novel noun-noun compounds and verbal compounds. The results support the hypothesis that organized lexical information, including natural classes, must be taken into account in addition to syntactic structure to determine the most likely meaning of compounds. The second study asks adults to rate different interpretations of verbal compounds. The results support the hypothesis that the syntax of verbal compounds constrains the relationship between the verb and modifier to a single verb-internal argument interpretation. Taken together, these results support a model where both the syntax and the lexical semantics are active, generative mechanisms. In the second part of this dissertation five child studies test the hypothesis that, given compositionality, children's knowledge of syntax and lexical semantics go hand in hand with their interpretation. Three studies examine children's production and interpretation of noun-noun compounds, with the goal of determining if children use lexical structure in the same way as adults when producing and interpreting compounds. The first noun-noun study is a corpus study. The results support the hypothesis that children and adults produce novel noun-noun compounds according to the natural classes of the constituents in compounds, but not the individual words in compounds. The second noun-noun compound study is an elicited production task. The results provide evidence for children's production of compounds for the same range of meanings as adults, albeit to a lesser degree overall. Finally, the third noun-noun compound study is a forced-choice interpretation task. The results support the hypothesis that children interpret novel compounds according to their knowledge of natural class behavior, rather than individual word behavior. Next, two studies examine children's production and interpretation of verbal compounds. The goal of these studies is to examine whether children's knowledge of verbal compound syntax, as evidenced by their production, makes predictions about children's comprehension of verbal compounds. The first study is an elicited production task. The results provide evidence for the idea that children's non-adult verbal compound forms (catch-mouse and catcher-mouse but not mouse-catch for mouse-catcher) reflect the steps in the adult derivation of verbal compounds. The second study is a forced-choice interpretation task. From the results we observe that children constrain their interpretation of verbal compounds based on their knowledge of the verbal compound structure. In summary, the results of the child studies provide evidence that children use the same system as adults to interpret compounds, and any deviations from adult-like interpretations can be explained by non-adult syntactic or lexical semantic knowledge.

Abstract = {This dissertation explores the development of words and categories with the intention of better understanding the organization of the lexicon. Study I investigates lexical organization, lexical access, and categorization in adults. In particular, I contrast the way adults access lexical items with the way they explicitly categorize these items. By testing speakers of two different languages—English and Mandarin—I also explore which aspects of lexical organization are universal and which are linguistically relative. Study II investigates the nature of lexical representation, access, and categorization in two- through nine-year-old typically-developing children. Additionally, I investigate the way developments in categorization do and do not coincide with development of the ability to articulate these categories, with the acquisition of relevant declarative knowledge, and with developments in other cognitive abilities. The results of the first two studies suggest that lexical organization and access are qualitatively different in young children than in adults. Study III investigates the nature of the lexicon and categories in children with autism. I find that although autistic children have many cognitive deficits, they seem to follow typical patterns of category development. Together, these studies improve our understanding of the nature and development of lexical organization, lexical access, and categorization.

Abstract = {This dissertation looks at native language (L1) influence on adult nonnative language (L2) lexical development, investigating, in particular, whether the syntactic and semantic properties underlying L1 words have effects on the acquisition of lexical equivalents in the L2. The investigation is motivated by the following crosslinguistic differences as instantiated in  wh-words in Chinese, Korean and English with respect to the existential sense: In Chinese, wh-words (e.g., shenme) can be used as existentials (i.e., ‘something/anything’) as well as interrogatives (i.e., ‘what’) (Cheng, 1991; Huang, 1982). Chinese  wh-existentials are confined to syntactico-semantic environments denoting nonveridicality (e.g., negatives, yes/no questions, conditionals) (Giannakidou, 2011); in Korean, wh-existentials are free of these restrictions (Gil & Marsden, 2013); and in English,  wh-words can never function as existentials. A comparative Interlanguage study is conducted to examine wh-existentials in the L2 Chinese of adult L1-Korean and L1-English speakers. The exploration centers on two main predictions based on Sprouse’s (2006) Lexical Transfer Hypothesis: (i) In nonveridical constructions, lower proficiency L1-Korean L2 learners of Chinese will pattern like Chinese native speakers in allowing  wh-existentials, whereas lower proficiency L1-English L2 learners will show inhibitions against them; (ii) in veridical constructions, lower proficiency L1-English L2 learners will perform like Chinese speakers in prohibiting nontarget wh-existentials, whereas lower proficiency L1-Korean L2 learners will be inclined to allow them. Intermediate and advanced L1-English and L1-Korean L2 learners of Chinese (English intermediate, n = 20; English advanced,  n = 22; Korean intermediate, n = 21; Korean advanced,  n = 20) and native speakers of Chinese (n = 30) completed three experiments targeting the interpretations of shenme ‘THING’ in nonveridical negative sentences and veridical present progressive sentences (contextualized multiple-choice interpretation task), the existential use of shenme ‘THING’ and shui ‘PERSON’ in nonveridical negative sentences and veridical present progressive sentences (elicited production task), and the acceptability judgments of existential shui ‘PERSON’ in yes/no questions and conditionals (acceptability judgment task). The results of the three experiments generally support the Lexical Transfer Hypothesis, which suggests that a deep level of lexical transfer – transfer of the syntactic and semantic properties underlying L1 lexical items – indeed influences L2 lexical development.

Abstract = {In this article we present two lexical decision experiments that examine the role of base frequency and of derivative suffix productivity in visual recognition of Spanish words. In the first experiment we find that complex words with productive derivative suffixes result in lower response times than those with unproductive derivative suffixes. There is no significant effect for base frequency, however. In experiment two, the same procedure was undertaken with pseudowords, showing that when they are composed by productive derivative suffixes they take longer to be rejected than when they are composed by unproductive derivative suffixes. Again, the role of base frequency fails to reach significance. These results endorse the view that derivative suffixes have a relevant role in visual recognition of complex words. According to our results, derivative suffixes create the conditions for taking a lexical candidate as a legal lexical entry and therefore they contribute decisively to the lexical decision.

Abstract = {The problem concerning the integration between gesture and word is not yet solved. However, one aspect of the mechanism reciprocally relating the two signals (gesture and word) should be considered. Some studies addressed the problem of how the production of each signal is modified by the production of the other signal, given that the two signals are integrated. These works suggest a relation between the two signals deeper than a synchronism and, specifically, a relation between amodal representations of the two signals. Conversely, other studies addressed the problem of whether the presentation of one signal (prime), either implicitly or explicitly, facilitated or interfered with comprehension of the other target. Integration and comprehension are two processes that can be independent of each other and this fact may explain the differences seen in cortical activation during them. Indeed, it is not guaranteed that the circuit involved in facilitation/inhibition is the same as that involved in the integration of the two signals. In other words, one unanswered question is whether integration is coupled with lexical decision/semantic judgment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

The main idea is to propose the N400 component of the Event-Related Potential (ERP) as an « empirical referee » between two paradigms aiming at understanding meaning constitution. The first one is the classic functionalist paradigm of cognitive sciences that describes computations for lexical access. The second one gathers Saussure structuralism, Husserlian phenomenology and Thom and Petitot morphodynamics (phenomenology, morphodynamics and structuralism, PMS paradigm). PMS assumes the co-presence of signified and signifier (Saussure), and the various modalisations of verbal consciousness (Husserl) together within a dynamics model involving meaning attractors without lexical access. The N400 component is proposed to empirically challenge the PMS paradigm that can help solve some empirical abnormalities that cannot be explained by the cognitive paradigm of lexical access.

I first consider the changes which target morphology, and inflection in particular. That is, are there changes which affect only inflection? Are there areas of morphology which are immune from other types of change, such as regular sound change? Can sound change be conditioned by morphology? These questions are addressed in Section 10.2. Authors have also been concerned with characterizing the nature of morphological change in terms of how 'natural' such changes are, what might condition 'unnatural' changes, and how this relates to the question of autonomy in morphological change. These are also questions addressed in this section. In Section 10.3, I discuss sources of morphology; how free words are grammaticalized and organized into paradigms; how changes can remodel existing morphology, and how new paradigms can be created. In Section 10.41 turn to an examination of how morphology has been used to establish language families, and the principles and assumptions that underlie this use of evidence (in contrast to sound change or lexical items).

This integration process is examined for information extracted from the end of the fixated word, the word to the right of the fixated word, and the word two words to the right of the fixated word. The review shows that the amount of information integrated across fixations varies for these three different types of previewed visual information. A large variety of information extracted from a parafoveal word is integrated across fixations, including orthography, phonology, and meaning. The chapter considers how such integration processes operate across several languages to allow understanding of how the way in which linguistic characteristics are orthographically coded in a particular language constrains parafoveal processing. It is concluded that readers preferentially integrate the information that is most useful for the initiation of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Among the many challenges of professional interpreting is translating lexical items that are grammatically close, but not identical, between two langunges. In this microanalysis, we examined the output of American Sign Language-English interpreters as they rendered English pronominal -self forms (e.g. itself, himself, ourselves) into ASL. In English, -self forms function primarily as reflexives, referring to an entity already named in the discourse. Less often in English, -self forms function as emphatics, to highlight a specific referent in the discourse. Conversely, the ASL sign SELF has been analysed functioning primarily as an emphatic in signed discourse. We investigated whether ASL-English interpreters rendered English -self forms primarily as reflexives, emphatics, or as some other grammatical function. The data consisted of six hours of video recorded English lectures that were interpreted into ASL. The results revealed a total of -self forms in the English lectures; while the interpreters produced 101 ASL SELF forms. Regarding grammatical function, results indicated both the English and ASL interpretations used the forms primarily as reflexives: 68 percent in English and 55 percent in the ASL interpretations. Contrary to prior analyses, only 21 percent of the SELF forms in the ASL interpretations were emphatic. The results suggest that interpretations contain traces of the source language in the output as the result of interference at the lexical level.

Abstract = {Tests of generative semantic verbal fluency are widely used to study organization and representation of concepts in the human brain. Previous studies demonstrated that clustering and switching behavior during verbal fluency tasks is supported by multiple brain mechanisms associated with semantic memory and executive control. Previous work relied on manual assessments of semantic relatedness between words and grouping of words into semantic clusters. We investigated a computational linguistic approach to measuring the strength of semantic relatedness between words based on latent semantic analysis of word co-occurrences in a subset of a large online encyclopedia. We computed semantic clustering indices and compared them to brain network connectivity measures obtained with task-free fMRI in a sample consisting of healthy participants and those differentially affected by cognitive impairment. We found that semantic clustering indices were associated with brain network connectivity in distinct areas including fronto-temporal, fronto-parietal and fusiform gyrus regions. This study shows that computerized semantic indices complement traditional assessments of verbal fluency to provide a more complete account of the relationship between brain and verbal behavior involved organization and retrieval of lexical information from memory.

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of Chinese‐specific morphological awareness on vocabulary acquisition among young Chinese‐speaking students. The participants were 288 Chinese‐speaking second graders from three different cities in China. Multiple regression analysis and mediation analysis were used to uncover the mediated and unmediated effects of morphological awareness on reading vocabulary knowledge. Results showed that both morphological awareness and lexical inference ability significantly contributed to reading vocabulary knowledge after each factor was controlled for. The ability to extract sublexical morphological information (in the form of derivational awareness and compound awareness) significantly predicted the students' reading vocabulary. More importantly, the study revealed that morphological awareness made a significant indirect contribution to reading vocabulary via lexical inference ability. Findings suggest that morphological awareness enhances young Chinese students' reading vocabulary acquisition by the partial mediation of their lexical inference ability.

Abstract = {Orthographies encode phonological information only at the level of words (chiefly, the information encoded concerns phonetic segments; in some cases, tonal information or default stress may be encoded). Of primary interest to second language (L2) learners is whether orthography can assist in clarifying L2 phonological distinctions that are particularly difficult to perceive (e.g., where one native-language phonemic category captures two L2 categories). A review of spoken-word recognition evidence suggests that orthographic information can install knowledge of such a distinction in lexical representations but that this does not affect learners’ ability to perceive the phonemic distinction in speech. Words containing the difficult phonemes become even harder for L2 listeners to recognize, because perception maps less accurately to lexical content.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Vocabulary Knowledge: Human Ratings and Automated Measures edited by S. Jarvis and M. Daller (2013). The field of modeling and assessing vocabulary knowledge and use has rapidly progressed recently and has produced a vast body of research. Jarvis and Daller's edited book is a landmark volume in this development, in that they not only collate state-of-the art empirical research papers in this area, but also integrate independent inquiries into a connected whole to expand the field. The strength of this book is that all the chapters on the development and validation of lexical measures explicitly examine wider aspects of validity than those in the volume's precursor. However, while these chapters can be considered good examples of validation studies of vocabulary measures, they would have been better presented if they had used argument-based validation frameworks, which are the most up-to-date tool in this regard and offer improvements that previous frameworks fail to handle. Although the book is clearly written and stimulating to researchers who have conducted similar analyses, more accessible descriptions and demonstrations would benefit those interested in, but unfamiliar with, the calculation of measures, examination of validity aspects, and building and testing of models. The book marks an important milestone for research into the development and validation of useful vocabulary indices and models by adopting a problem-centering approach and addressing human cognitions in its conceptualization of lexical aspects.

Abstract = {Because of its structural characteristics, specifically the prevalence of verb types in infant-directed speech and frequent pronoun-dropping, the Italian language offers an attractive opportunity to investigate the predictive effects of input frequency and positional salience on children’s acquisition of nouns and verbs. We examined this issue in a sample of twenty-six mother–child dyads whose spontaneous conversations were recorded, transcribed, and coded at 1;4 and 1;8. The percentages of nouns occurring in the final position of maternal utterances at 1;4 predicted children’s production of noun types at 1;8. For verbs, children’s growth rates were positively predicted by the percentages of input verbs occurring in utterance-initial position, but negatively predicted by the percentages of verbs located in the final position of maternal utterances at 1;4. These findings clearly illustrate that the effects of positional salience vary across lexical categories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a quasi-experimental study, 24 Asian Indian mothers were asked to teach novel (target) names for two objects and two actions to their children of three different levels of lexical mapping development: prelexical (5–8 months), early lexical (9–17 months), and advanced lexical (20–43 months). Target naming (n =1482) and non-target naming (other, n =2411) were coded for synchronous spoken words and object motion (multimodal motherese) and other naming styles. Indian mothers abundantly used multimodal motherese with target words to highlight novel word–referent relations, paralleling earlier findings from American mothers. They used it with target words more often for prelexical infants than for advanced lexical children and to name target actions later in children’s development. Unlike American mothers, Indian mothers also abundantly used multimodal motherese to name target objects later in children’s development. Finally, monolingual mothers who spoke a verb-dominant Indian language used multimodal motherese more often than bilingual mothers who also spoke noun-dominant English to their children. The findings suggest that within a dynamic and reciprocal mother–infant communication system, multimodal motherese adapts to unify novel words and referents across cultures. It adapts to children’s level of lexical development and to ambient language-specific lexical dominance hierarchies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The magnitude of the semantic priming effect is known to increase as the proportion of related prime–target pairs in an experiment increases. This relatedness proportion (RP) effect was studied in a lexical decision task at a short prime–target stimulus onset asynchrony (240 ms), which is widely assumed to preclude strategic prospective usage of the prime. The analysis of the reaction time (RT) distribution suggested that the observed RP effect reflected a modulation of a retrospective semantic matching process. The pattern of the RP effect on the RT distribution found here is contrasted to that reported in De Wit and Kinoshita’s (2014) semantic categorization study, and it is concluded that the RP effect is driven by different underlying mechanisms in lexical decision and semantic categorization.

Abstract = {This study addresses how top‐down predictions driven by phonological and semantic information interact on spoken‐word comprehension. To do so, we measured event‐related potentials to words embedded in sentences that varied in the degree of semantic constraint (high or low) and in regional accent (congruent or incongruent) with respect to the target word pronunciation. The data showed a negative amplitude shift following phonological mismatch (target pronunciation incongruent with respect to sentence regional accent). Here, we show that this shift is modulated by sentence‐level semantic constraints over latencies encompassing auditory (N100) and lexical (N400) components. These findings suggest a fast influence of top‐down predictions and the interplay with bottom‐up processes at sublexical and lexical levels of analysis.

Abstract = {Recent results from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies provide evidence of a ventral-lexical stream and a dorsal-sublexical stream associated with reading processing. We investigated the relationship between behavioural reading speed for stimuli thought to rely on either the ventral-lexical, dorsal-sublexical, or both streams and white matter via fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) using DTI tractography. Participants (N = 32) overtly named exception words (e.g., ‘one’, ventral-lexical), regular words (e.g., ‘won’, both streams), nonwords (‘wum’, dorsal-sublexical) and pseudohomophones (‘wun’, dorsal-sublexical) in a behavioural lab. Each participant then underwent a brain scan that included a 30-directional DTI sequence. Tractography was used to extract FA and MD values from four tracts of interest: inferior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Median reaction times (RTs) for reading exception words and regular words both showed a significant correlation with the FA of the uncinate fasciculus thought to underlie the ventral processing stream, such that response time decreased as FA increased. In addition, RT for exception and regular words showed a relationship with MD of the uncinate fasciculus, such that response time increased as MD increased. Multiple regression analyses revealed that exception word RT accounted for unique variability in FA of the uncinate over and above regular words. There were no robust relationships found between pseudohomophones, or nonwords, and tracts thought to underlie the dorsal processing stream. These results support the notion that word recognition, in general, and exception word reading in particular, rely on ventral-lexical brain regions.

The youngest infants learned the label–object mappings, but the older groups did not, despite being able to discriminate pitch differences in an object‐free task (Experiment 3, N = 14). Results indicate that 14‐month‐olds remain flexible regarding what sounds make meaningful distinctions between words.

In the present study, 77 writing samples from a mixed group of Grade 3 children were analyzed for features of linguistic diversity using public domain vocabulary-profiling software. The writing was also evaluated holistically on a trait-based rubric. Data analysis identified the salient features of linguistic diversity correlating to quality standards of writing; the key is 'lexical stretch' or use of low-frequency and 'off-list known' words. Implications for assessment include the potential to identify children in need of vocabulary enrichment at an early stage in the educational trajectory and to track their evolving vocabulary growth in the shape of their lexical profile over time.

The time it takes to name the target picture is affected (among specific properties of the picture and the word) by the relationship between the naming response and the distractor stimulus.

However, naming latencies are slower in the context of distractor words that are semantic coordinates of the naming response (semantic interference).

The results indicate that the identified structures are rather short and flexible, far from the ordered and strict model of Bruner. The most used is the structure to 1 word 'isolated name or designation'. Scaffolding strategies employed by the mother take into account the nature of the dialogical behaviours of two twins as soon as the child is able to designate by pointing (i.e. over 18 months), adult employs imitative repetition. This strategy appears to play a key role in lexicon acquisition process. It is also used by each child who over 21 months refers to the adult model to increase their lexical stock.

Abstract = {This study assesses the diagnostic accuracy and construct validity of a sentence repetition task that is commonly used for the identification of French children with specific language impairment (SLI). Thirty-four school-aged children with a confirmed, diagnostically based diagnosis of SLI, and 34 control children matched on age and nonverbal abilities performed the sentence repetition task. Two general scoring measures took into account the verbatim repetition of the sentence and the number of words accurately repeated. Moreover, five other scoring measures were applied to their answers in order to separately take into account their respect of lexical items, functional items, syntax, verb morphology, and the general meaning of the sentence. Results show good to high levels of sensitivity and specificity at the three cut-off points for all scoring measures. A principal component analysis revealed two factors. Scoring measures for the respect of functional words, syntax and verb morphology provided the largest loadings to the first factor, while scoring measures for the respect of lexical words and general semantics provided the largest loadings to the second factor. Sentence repetition appears to be a valuable tool to identify SLI in French children, and the ability to repeat sentences correctly is supported by two factors: a morphosyntactic factor and a lexical factor.

In the Morphology Reliable condition, the known word part in the pseudo compounds provided semantic information about the meaning of the compounds, which also matched the context of the sentences. In the Morphology Unreliable condition, the known word part did not provide any reliable semantic information nor did it match the context. The critical answer options were the meanings based on morphological information and the meanings based on contextual information. Results indicated significant differences in the choice of answers between the groups only in the Morphology Unreliable condition: The beginning‐level learners relied more on morphological information even though the meanings based on morphology were incorrect.

Abstract = {In skilled reading, fixations are brief periods of time in which the eyes settle on words. E-Z Reader, a computational model of dynamic reading, posits that fixation durations are under real-time control of lexical processing. Lexical processing, in turn, requires efficient visual encoding. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in fixation durations are related to individual differences in the efficiency of early visual encoding. To test this hypothesis, we recorded participantsʼ eye movements during reading. We then examined individual differences in fixation duration distributions as a function of individual differences in the morphology of primary visual cortex measured from MRI scans. The results showed that greater gray matter surface area and volume in visual cortex predicted shorter and less variable fixation durations in reading. These results suggest that individual differences in eye movements during skilled reading are related to initial visual encoding, consistent with models such as E-Z Reader that emphasize lexical control over fixation time.

Abstract = {Because pronunciation information conveyed by Chinese characters is very limited, Pinyin represents a modem phonic transcription system of Chinese characters and assists Chinese children and foreigners in learning pronunciation of characters. Pinyin promotes the connections between the character graphic and phonological information. Over the past few years, a growing body of research has compared the alphabetic Pinyin and logographic characters to investigate whether the word forms affect brain processing during reading. However, few studies have directly examined whether while reading Pinyin, the corresponding orthography of the character becomes activated. The current study focused on the activation of character graphic representation during Pinyin processing. Four experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 and 2 explored the activation of character orthography in an automatic Pinyin reading task whereas Experiment 3 and 4 examined character activation during a Pinyin semantic judgment task. Experiment 1 and 2 employed a Stroop-like priming task. The Pinyin prime word was presented for 300ms, which was subsequently replaced by the target character. The target character would stay on the screen for 2000ms or until a color decision response was made. Sixty-four characters were chosen as targets. Half had similar graphic to prime characters, which were presented in Pinyin and the other half did not. In Experiment 3 and 4, the Pinyin prime word was exposed until participants made a semantic judgment response, followed immediately by a target character. In contrast to previous three experiments. Experiment 4 employed a naming task in which participants named the target character. The primes and targets were identical to those in Experiment 1. The effect of target type was observed only in the Pinyin semantic judgment task. The character graphic priming effect was inhibitory when the target characters had a similar graphic to the prime characters, which were presented in Pinyin, suggesting that graphic information was activated during Pinyin semantic processing and interfered with the judgment of similar target characters. It underscored the potential importance of the character graphic information in Pinyin semantic processing. In contrast, the inhibitory effect disappeared in the automatic Pinyin reading task, indicating that character orthography might not be activated during Pinyin automatic processing. These findings suggested that the involvement of character graphic information in Pinyin processing likely depends on the task demands. The activation of the character graphic information during Pinyin semantic processing supported the interaction of lexical constituents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to investigate the flexibility of letter-position encoding in word identification during reading. In both experiments, two tasks were used. First, participants’ eye movements were measured as they read sentences containing transposed letter (TL) strings. Second, participants were presented with the TL strings in isolation and were asked to discriminate them from nonwords. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the distance between transposed letters (ligament vs. liagment vs. limagent vs. lieamgnt). Reading/response times increased with the distance between TLs. In Experiment 2, we manipulated whether the TLs were consonants, vowels, or one of each (ssytem vs. faeture vs. fromat). Reading/response times showed that CV transpositions were the most disruptive. In both experiments, response accuracy was particularly poor for words presented in isolation when there was an intervening letter between TLs. These data show that processing across multiple fixations, and the presence of a meaningful sentence context, are important for flexible letter position encoding in lexical identification.

Abstract = {Objective: Computation of a prearticulatory phonological representation (phonological access, or phonological retrieval) is an essential process in speech production whose neural localization is not clear. This study combined a specific behavioral measure of phonological access and multivariate voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) in a series of left hemisphere stroke patients to identify brain regions critical for this process. Methods: Phonological access was assessed in 40 chronic ischemic stroke patients using a silent rhyming task to avoid confounds with motor planning and articulation deficits. Additional covariates were incorporated in the VLSM analysis to control for orthographic and working memory demands of the rhyming task, and for age, education, and total lesion volume. The resulting t statistic maps were thresholded at voxelwise p < 0.001 and cluster-corrected at a familywise error of p < 0.05. Results: Phonological access impairment was correlated with damage to a focal region of cortex and white matter caudal to the posterior sylvian fissure, which included the posterior supramarginal gyrus and adjacent anterior angular gyrus, planum temporale, and posterior superior temporal gyrus. No correlation was observed with Broca’s area, insula, or sensorimotor cortex. An additional VLSM showed no correlation between damage in this posterior perisylvian region and spoken word comprehension. Interpretation: This is the first demonstration of a specific lesion correlate for phonological access impairment. Although this posterior perisylvian region overlaps with some versions of the classical Wernicke area, the present results demonstrate its involvement in prearticulatory phonological production rather than speech perception or lexical– semantic processes.

Abstract = {The goal of the study was to examine the association between visual‐attentional span and lexical decision in skilled adult readers. In the span tasks, an array of letters was presented briefly and recognition or production of a single cued letter (partial span) or production of all letters (whole span) was required. Independently of letter recognition and phoneme awareness, width of partial recognition span predicted substantial variance only in detection of letter misorderings in words, while partial span efficiency made small contributions to decisions on regular words and pseudowords, but not strange words. With a production format and the inclusion of short‐term phonological memory, neither partial‐span nor whole‐span measures contributed positive independent variance to word and nonword decisions. The results provide meagre support for the idea that skilled adult readers with a wide visual‐attentional span might process words more effectively than those with a narrow span during lexical decision.

Abstract = {In an eye tracking experiment during reading we examined whether preview benefit could be observed from 2 words to the right of the currently fixated word if that word was the 2nd constituent of a spaced compound. The boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975) was used to orthogonally manipulate whether participants saw an identity or nonword preview of the 1st (e.g., teddy) and 2nd constituent (e.g., bear) of a spaced compound located immediately beyond the boundary, respectively, words n + 1 and n + 2. Linear mixed-effects models revealed that participants gained an n + 2 preview benefit, such that they spent less time fixated on word n + 1 when given an identity preview of word n + 2. However, this effect was only observed if there was also an identity preview of word n + 1. Our findings suggest that the 2 constituent words of spaced compounds are processed as part of a larger lexical unit during natural reading.

Abstract = {We investigated the neural basis of inhibitory control during lexical selection. Participants overtly named pictures while response times (RTs) and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The difficulty of lexical selection was manipulated by using object and action pictures with high name agreement (few response candidates) versus low name agreement (many response candidates). To assess the involvement of inhibition, we conducted delta plot analyses of naming RTs and examined the N2 component of the ERP. We found longer mean naming RTs and a larger N2 amplitude in the low relative to the high name agreement condition. For action naming we found a negative correlation between the slopes of the slowest delta segment and the difference in N2 amplitude between the low and high name agreement conditions. The converging behavioral and electrophysiological evidence suggests that selective inhibition is engaged to reduce competition during lexical selection in picture naming.

Abstract = {Purpose: In the present study, the authors examined lexical naming in children with cochlear implants (CIs). The goal was to determine whether children with CIs have deficits in lexical access and organization as revealed through reaction time in picture-naming and verbal fluency (VF) experiments. Method: Children with CIs (n = 20, ages 7–10) were compared with 20 children with normal hearing (NH) matched for age and nonverbal IQ. Lexical abilities were examined using two naming tasks: a timed picture-naming task and a phonological and semantic VF naming task. Picture naming taps into lexical access capabilities and the VF task elucidates lexical organization. Results: No group differences were found between children with CIs and children with NH on the timed picture-naming task. Children with CIs generated significantly fewer words than the children with NH on the VF tasks. Larger group differences were found for the phonological VF task compared with the semantic VF task. Conclusions: Limited early linguistic and auditory experiences may affect lexical representations and organization (lexical-semantic connections) in school-age children with hearing loss who use CIs. Further analyses and studies should continue to examine these underlying linguistic deficits. The present results suggest a need to emphasize not only increasing the size of children’s vocabularies during therapy, but also expanding and increasing the semantic and phonological richness of their lexical representations.

Abstract = {Language-users reduce words in predictable contexts. Previous research indicates that reduction may be stored in lexical representation if a word is often reduced. Because representation influences production regardless of context, production should be biased by how often each word has been reduced in the speaker’s prior experience. This study investigates whether speakers have a context-independent bias to reduce low-informativity words, which are usually predictable and therefore usually reduced. Content word durations were extracted from the Buckeye and Switchboard speech corpora, and analyzed for probabilistic reduction effects using a language model based on spontaneous speech in the Fisher corpus. The analysis supported the hypothesis: low-informativity words have shorter durations, even when the effects of local contextual predictability, frequency, speech rate, and several other variables are controlled for. Additional models that compared word types against only other words of the same segmental length further supported this conclusion. Words that usually appear in predictable contexts are reduced in all contexts, even those in which they are unpredictable. The result supports representational models in which reduction is stored, and where sufficiently frequent reduction biases later production. The finding provides new evidence that probabilistic reduction interacts with lexical representation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two experiments explore the extent of morphological root-based spreading activation in adult skilled readers of Hebrew. Participants performed semantic judgements on sentences in Hebrew, half of which included sentence-final incongruent targets. Critical targets were morphologically related but semantically unrelated to an expected but non-presented congruent sentence completion, and control items had no such morphological relation. Participants were slower and more error-prone in correctly rejecting critical targets than controls, due to the morphological relation with the congruent completion. These results demonstrate that prediction-based lexical activation in the absence of form exposure can support morphologically based spreading activation in Hebrew. Furthermore, semantic constraints do not completely eliminate activation of morphologically related but semantically incongruous lexical candidates, similar to patterns found for ambiguous lexical items in other languages. Taken together, these results support and extend the central role of the morphological root in shaping lexical organisation and dynamics of lexical access in Hebrew.

Abstract = {Prosodic context several syllables prior (i.e., distal) to an ambiguous word boundary influences speech segmentation. To assess whether distal prosody influences early perceptual processing or later lexical competition, EEG was recorded while subjects listened to eight-syllable sequences with ambiguous word boundaries for the last four syllables (e.g., tie murder bee vs. timer derby). Pitch and duration of the first five syllables were manipulated to induce sequence segmentation with either a monosyllabic or disyllabic final word. Behavioural results confirmed a successful manipulation. Moreover, penultimate syllables (e.g., der) elicited a larger anterior positivity 200–500 ms after the onset for prosodic contexts predicted to induce word-initial perception of these syllables. Final syllables (e.g. bee) elicited a similar anterior positivity in the context predicted to induce word-initial perception of these syllables. Additionally, these final syllables elicited a larger positive-to-negative deflection (P1-N1) 60–120 ms after onset, and a larger N400. The finding that prosodic characteristics of speech several syllables prior to ambiguous word boundaries modulate both early and late event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by subsequent syllable onsets provides evidence that distal prosody influences early perceptual processing and later lexical competition.

Abstract = {The current research investigated how infants apply prior knowledge of environmental regularities to support new learning. The experiments tested whether infants could exploit experience with native language (English) phonotactic patterns to facilitate associating sounds with meanings during word learning. Infants (14-month-olds) heard fluent speech that contained cues for detecting target words; the target words were embedded in sequences that occur across word boundaries. A separate group heard the target words embedded without word boundary cues. Infants then participated in an object label learning task. With the opportunity to use native language patterns to segment the target words, infants subsequently learned the labels. Without this experience, infants failed. Novice word learners can take advantage of early learning about sounds to scaffold lexical development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Although much is known about how contextualized and decontextualized learning affects explicit lexical knowledge, how these learning conditions contribute to implicit lexical knowledge remains unclear. To address this problem, Korean high school students were instructed to learn 30 English words by reading meaningful passages (i.e., in context) and another 30 English words using a wordlist (i.e., out of context). Five weeks later, implicit lexical knowledge was gauged by reaction time and the N400 event-related brain potential component, and explicit lexical knowledge was assessed with an explicit behavioral measure. Results showed that neither learning type was superior to the other in terms of implicit lexical knowledge acquisition, whereas learning words out of context was more effective than learning words in context for establishing explicit lexical knowledge. These results suggest that the presence or absence of context may lead to dissociation in the development of implicit and explicit lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {University students performed lexical tasks with visually presented target words after the presentation of an identical or unrelated prime, at short (80–120 ms) or longer (410–710 ms) prime–target stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). Experiment 1 showed perceptual identification benefits in vocal responding at a short SOA that were reduced (accuracy) or reversed (latency) at a longer SOA. Experiment 2 showed a transition from a repetition benefit to a cost over 3 SOAs in a target-masked version of the lexical decision task (LDT; target displayed for only 141 ms). In Experiment 3 the repetition cost was replicated at a 530-ms SOA in the LDT with masked targets, but a repetition benefit was observed in the conventional LDT (target displayed until response). The dependence of repetition costs on target masking is more consistent with biases based on episodic confusions than refractoriness of lexical representations.

Abstract = {In opaque orthographies, the activation of orthographic and phonological codes follows distinct time courses during visual word recognition. However, it is unclear how orthography and phonology are accessed in more transparent orthographies. Therefore, we conducted time course analyses of masked priming effects in the transparent Dutch orthography. The first study used targets with small phonological differences between phonological and orthographic primes, which are typical in transparent orthographies. Results showed consistent orthographic priming effects, yet phonological priming effects were absent. The second study explicitly manipulated the strength of the phonological difference and revealed that both orthographic and phonological priming effects became identifiable when phonological differences were strong enough. This suggests that, similar to opaque orthographies, strong phonological differences are a prerequisite to separate orthographic and phonological priming effects in transparent orthographies. Orthographic and phonological priming appeared to follow distinct time courses, with orthographic codes being quickly translated into phonological codes and phonology dominating the remainder of the lexical access phase.

Abstract = {Studies on antonym co-occurrence have mainly focused on its frequency, the lexico-grammatical patterns in which antonym pairs co-occur, its discourse functions and the preferred ordering of antonym pairs. The interpretation of antonym co-occurrence constructions has been understudied. This paper addresses the cognitive motivation underlying the interpretation of antonym co-occurrence constructions based on a detailed analysis of the Chinese construction you X you Y. This construction retains a literal meaning which stems from its juxtaposed syntax, but it also has non-compositional meanings. It can indicate exhaustiveness of the domain involved and express a sense of diversity. We argue that the semantic interpretation of the construction is rooted in metonymic inference triggered by the co-occurring antonym pairs. We also contend that the meaning derived via metonymic inference may exhibit further meaning extension by virtue of conceptual metaphor. Finally, we examine the non-canonical antonym pairs in the construction and propose that the motivation for licensing non-canonical antonym pairs to co-occur in the construction can be attributed to relational coercion exerted by the construction on the sense relation between lexical items.

Abstract = {High quality lexical representations in memory, characterized by accuracy and stability, are said to underpin fluent reading. Here, the relationship between orthographic quality and reading speed was examined by asking undergraduates (N = 74) to repeatedly read and spell words. Spelling performance over five trials indicated orthographic quality. Single word reading speed was measured using E-Prime technology. A within-participant repeated measures analysis revealed that words which participants spelled consistently accurately, were read faster than words which were misspelled. This pattern also held in a within-word analysis; the same words were read faster by individuals who always spelled them correctly, compared to those who did not. Further, it was found that when words were spelled using the same incorrect letter patterns across trials (i.e., in the same erroneous way), they were read faster than when they had an incorrect but less stable representation (i.e., inconsistent spelling across trials). Hence, the difference in reading speed appears to be a function of both the accuracy and stability of the orthographic representations stored in memory, rather than due to characteristics of individual participants or words. These results lend support for a central role of lexical quality in both spelling and reading, and are discussed with reference to the lexical quality hypothesis.

As different tasks were used in French and English, we sought to clarify this ambiguity by using an interactive word-learning study similar to that used in French, with British-English-learning toddlers aged 1;4 and 1;11. Children were taught two CVC labels differing on either a consonant or vowel and tested on their pairing of a third object named with one of the previously taught labels, or part of them. In concert with previous research on British-English toddlers, our results provided no evidence of a general consonant bias. The language-specific mechanisms explaining the differential status for consonants and vowels in lexical development are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {While grammatical context effects have been largely documented, their exact nature remains unclear. To determine the locus of these effects, we explored the priming in very strong grammatical contexts, that is, the priming of verbs by immediately preceding French pronominal subjects. In French, the first and second person plural pronouns are always associated with the same verbal inflections, creating very strong grammatical contexts. Participants made lexical decisions on targets (verb vs. pseudoverb) which were presented in three contexts: pronoun-congruent (nous grimpons, we climb), pronoun-incongruent (vous grimpons, you climb) or pseudoword control (zous grimpons, zous climb). Two experiments were conducted: one in the auditory modality and one in the visual modality. Grammatical context effects in the auditory modality did not vary as a function of the ISI, and no grammatical context effect was observed in the visual modality when the context was presented subliminally. These findings suggest that grammatical context effects operate at a post-lexical locus. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Speakers usually produce words in connected speech. In such contexts, the form in which many words are uttered is influenced by the phonological properties of neighboring words. The current article examines the representations and processes underlying the production of phonologically constrained word form variations. For this purpose, we consider determiners whose form is sensitive to phonological context (e.g., in English: acar vs. ananimal; in French: lechien ‘the dog’ vs. l’âne ‘the donkey’). Two hypotheses have been proposed regarding how these words are processed. Determiners either are thought to have different representations for each of their surface forms, or they are thought to have only 1 representation while other forms are generated online after selection through a rule-based process. We tested the predictions derived from these 2 views in 3 picture naming experiments. Participants named pictures using determiner–adjective–noun phrases (e.g., la nouvelle table ‘the new table’). Phonologically consistent or inconsistent conditions were contrasted, based on the phonological onsets of the adjective and the noun. Results revealed shorter naming latencies for consistent than for inconsistent sequences (i.e., a phonological consistency effect) for all the determiner types tested. Our interpretation of these findings converges on the assumption that determiners with varying surface forms are represented in memory with multiple phonological-lexical representations. This conclusion is discussed in relation to models of determiner processing and models of lexical variability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We report two experiments attempting to identify the role of semantic relatedness in picture-word interference studies. Previously published data sets have rendered results which directly contradict each other, with one study suggesting that the stronger the relation between picture and distractor, the more semantic interference is obtained, and another study suggesting the opposite pattern. We replicated the two key experiments with only minor procedural modifications, and found semantic interference effects in both. Critically, these were largely independent of the strength of semantic overlap. Additionally, we attempted to predict individual interference effects per target picture, via various measures of semantic overlap, which also failed to account for the effects. From our results it appears that semantic interference effects in picture-word tasks are similarly present for weakly and strongly overlapping combinations. Implications are discussed in the light of the recent debate on the role of competition in lexical selection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The commonly used test to evaluate naming ability in multiple sclerosis (MS) is the Boston Naming Test (BNT). In previous studies the BNP has not shown any specific deficit in MS patients. The BNT score is obtained by adding spontaneously correct answers to correct answers obtained after semantic and phonological clues are given. Our hypothesis was that due to a lexical access deficit based on executive dysfunction, MS patients would need more clues than control subjects to normalize their performances,. Fifteen relapsing-remitting (RR) and 17 secondary progressive (SP) MS patients, and 32 controls matched for sex, age, and educational level, took the BNT. The 32 MS patients also took the BCCog (Short French battery used in MS to evaluate cognitive functions) in order to evaluate their executive functions. MS patients needed significantly more clues than matched controls to normalize their performances (P < 0.001). This lexical access deficit was more frequent in the SP than in the RR group (P < 0.05). A lexical access deficit inducing a denomination problem has thus been shown in MS patients. Further research should aim to better evaluate the executive functions of patients with a lexical access deficit. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Abstract A growing body of evidence in cognitive psychology and neuroscience suggests a deep interconnection between sensory‐motor and language systems in the brain. Based on recent neurophysiological findings on the anatomo‐functional organization of the fronto‐parietal network, we present a computational model showing that language processing may have reused or co‐developed organizing principles, functionality, and learning mechanisms typical of premotor circuit. The proposed model combines principles of Hebbian topological self‐organization and prediction learning. Trained on sequences of either motor or linguistic units, the network develops independent neuronal chains, formed by dedicated nodes encoding only context‐specific stimuli. Moreover, neurons responding to the same stimulus or class of stimuli tend to cluster together to form topologically connected areas similar to those observed in the brain cortex. Simulations support a unitary explanatory framework reconciling neurophysiological motor data with established behavioral evidence on lexical acquisition, access, and recall.

Abstract = {Listeners use lexical or visual context information to recalibrate auditory speech perception. After hearing an ambiguous auditory stimulus between /aba/ and /ada/ coupled with a clear visual stimulus (e.g., lip closure in /aba/), an ambiguous auditory-only stimulus is perceived in line with the previously seen visual stimulus. What remains unclear, however, is what exactly listeners are recalibrating: phonemes, phone sequences, or acoustic cues. To address this question we tested generalization of visually-guided auditory recalibration to (1) the same phoneme contrast cued differently (i.e., /aba/-/ada/ vs. /ibi/-/idi/ where the main cues are formant transitions in the vowels vs. burst and frication of the obstruent), (2) a different phoneme contrast cued identically (/aba/-/ada/ vs. /ama/-/ana/ both cued by formant transitions in the vowels), and (3) the same phoneme contrast with the same cues in a different acoustic context (/aba/-/ada/ vs. /ubu/-/udu/). Whereas recalibration was robust for all recalibration control trials, no generalization was found in any of the experiments. This suggests that perceptual recalibration may be more specific than previously thought as it appears to be restricted to the phoneme category experienced during exposure as well as to the specific manipulated acoustic cues. We suggest that recalibration affects context-dependent sub-lexical units. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Translation equivalents (TEs) characterize the lexicon of bilinguals from the early stages of acquisition, as reported in studies involving English and other languages in which most cross-language synonyms are dissimilar in phonological form. This research explores the emergence of TEs in Spanish-Catalan bilinguals who are acquiring two languages with many cognate words and thus languages with many cross-language synonyms with identical or similar phonological forms. Expressive vocabulary was obtained in two 18-month-old groups (monolingual and bilingual, N = 24 each) through parental report using a bilingual questionnaire. Four different vocabulary size measures were computed in bilinguals, correcting for different types of phonological overlap in words across their two languages. Bilinguals were found comparable to monolinguals in every measure except for Total Vocabulary Size (Spanish + Catalan words) in which they outscored monolinguals due to the high number of form-identical cross-language elements in their expressive vocabularies. Form-similar and dissimilar TEs accounted for less than 2% of the words produced and were only present in infants with larger vocabularies. Results support the hypothesis that phonological form proximity between words across bilinguals' two languages facilitates early lexical acquisition.

We examine, using MEG, the effects of sublexical and lexical variables at superior temporal (ST) areas and the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) compared with that of word imageability at visual cortices. Embodied accounts predict early modulation of visual areas by imageability – concurrently with or prior to modulation of pMTG by lexical variables. Participants responded to speech stimuli varying continuously in imageability during lexical decision with simultaneous MEG recording. We employed the linguistic variables in a new type of correlational time course analysis to assess trial-by-trial activation in occipital, ST, and pMTG regions of interest (ROIs). The linguistic variables modulated the ROIs during different time windows. Critically, visual regions reflected an imageability effect prior to effects of lexicality on pMTG. This surprising effect supports a view on which sensory aspects of a lexical item are not a consequence of lexical activation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Lexical processing among bilinguals is often affected by complex patterns of individual experience. In this paper we discuss the psychocentric perspective on language representation and processing, which highlights the centrality of individual experience in psycholinguistic experimentation. We discuss applications to the investigation of lexical processing among multilinguals and explore the advantages of using high-density experiments with multilinguals. High density experiments are designed to co-index measures of lexical perception and production, as well as participant profiles. We discuss the challenges associated with the characterization of participant profiles and present a new data visualization technique, that we term Facial Profiles. This technique is based on Chernoff faces developed over 40 years ago. The Facial Profile technique seeks to overcome some of the challenges associated with the use of Chernoff faces, while maintaining the core insight that recoding multivariate data as facial features can engage the human face recognition system and thus enhance our ability to detect and interpret patterns within multivariate datasets. We demonstrate that Facial Profiles can code participant characteristics in lexical processing studies by recoding variables such as reading ability, speaking ability, and listening ability into iconically-related relative sizes of eye, mouth, and ear, respectively. The balance of ability in bilinguals can be captured by creating composite facial profiles or Janus Facial Profiles. We demonstrate the use of Facial Profiles and Janus Facial Profiles in the characterization of participant effects in the study of lexical perception and production.

Abstract = {Comprehension and/or production of noun phrases and sentences requires the selection of lexical-syntactic attributes of nouns. These lexical-syntactic attributes include grammatical gender (masculine/feminine/neuter), number (singular/plural) and countability (mass/count). While there has been considerable discussion regarding gender and number, relatively little attention has focused on countability. Therefore, this article reviews empirical evidence for lexical-syntactic specification of nouns for countability. This includes evidence from studies of language production and comprehension with normal speakers and case studies which assess impairments of mass/count nouns in people with acquired brain damage. Current theories of language processing are reviewed and found to be lacking specification regarding countability. Subsequently, the theoretical implications of the empirical studies are discussed in the context of frameworks derived from these accounts of language production ( Levelt, 1989; Levelt et al., 1999) and comprehension ( Taler and Jarema, 2006). The review concludes that there is empirical support for specification of nouns for countability at a lexical-syntactic level. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We explored the impact of a degraded semantic system on lexical, morphological and syntactic complexity in language production. We analysed transcripts from connected speech samples from eight patients with semantic dementia (SD) and eight age-matched healthy speakers. The frequency distributions of nouns and verbs were compared for hand-scored data and data extracted using text-analysis software. Lexical measures showed the predicted pattern for nouns and verbs in hand-scored data, and for nouns in software-extracted data, with fewer low frequency items in the speech of the patients relative to controls. The distribution of complex morpho-syntactic forms for the SD group showed a reduced range, with fewer constructions that required multiple auxiliaries and inflections. Finally, the distribution of syntactic constructions also differed between groups, with a pattern that reflects the patients' characteristic anomia and constraints on morpho-syntactic complexity. The data are in line with previous findings of an absence of gross syntactic errors or violations in SD speech. Alterations in the distributions of morphology and syntax, however, support constraint satisfaction models of speech production in which there is no hard boundary between lexical retrieval and grammatical encoding.

Abstract = {Lexical access during speech comprehension comprises numerous computations, including activation, competition, and selection. The spatio-temporal profile of these processes involves neural activity in peri-auditory cortices at least as early as 200 ms after stimulation. Their oscillatory dynamics are less well understood, although reports link alpha band de-synchronization with lexical processing. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine whether these alpha-related oscillations reflect the speed of lexical access, as would be predicted if they index lexical activation. In an auditory semantic priming protocol, monosyllabic nouns were presented while participants performed a lexical decision task. Spatially-localizing beamforming was used to examine spectro-temporal effects in left and right auditory cortex time-locked to target word onset. Alpha and beta de-synchronization (10–20 Hz ERD) was attenuated for words following a related prime compared to an unrelated prime beginning about 270 ms after stimulus onset. This timing is consistent with how information about word identity unfolds incrementally in speech, quantified in information-theoretic terms. These findings suggest that alpha de-synchronization during auditory word processing is associated with early stages of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Higher-order semantic impairments and lack of sensitivity to linguistic context have both been implicated in formal thought disorder (FTD) in schizophrenia. Most investigations have focused on comprehension. We investigated the processing of higher-order semantic relations and the role of emotional arousal in FTD patients' linguistic comprehension and production. We compared FTD schizophrenia patients (n=14) with non-FTD schizophrenia patients (n=18) and healthy controls (n=15) on sense-judgment and repetition tasks, in emotionally negative and neutral conditions. We predicted that the FTD group would display poor sensitivity compared to the other two groups in comprehension and production, and that this would be exacerbated by sentence complexity and negative emotional arousal. The emotional manipulation was not robustly successful, and did not affect task performance in the patient groups. FTD patients made significantly more errors on sense-judgments and repetition than the other two groups. Complexity affected all groups to a similar extent in sense-judgments, but affected FTD patients disproportionately in the repetition task. These results support the view that a lack of sensitivity to context underlies FTD in comprehension and production stages of processing. Patients fail to utilise linguistic context to integrate lexical forms into a global whole and guide their access to lexical targets. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Fourteen children with Typical Language Development (TLD) and 16 age-matched children with SLI (8;0–9;11 years) participated. In a Lexical Decision (LD) task with implicit semantic priming, children judged whether a given speech pair contained two words (semantically related/unrelated) or a word-pseudoword. Children received a comprehensive language and reading test battery. Children with TLD exhibited significant semantic priming; they were faster for semantically related word pairs than for unrelated (p < .001) and than for word-pseudoword pairs (p < .0002). The group with SLI did not exhibit significant semantic priming, despite showing more variability. Children with SLI made significantly slower LDs [F(1, 26) = 4.61, p < .05, partial η² = .15] and more errors [F(1, 26) = 4.16, p < .05, partial η² = .13] than children with TLD. Mean response time across all LD conditions and the receptive vocabulary (PPVT-III) were significantly negativity correlated for children with SLI (r = –.71, p = .004). Children with SLI, especially those with the poorest language scores, showed a semantic-lexical deficit and a weakness in lexical-semantic association networks. Their performance on the LD task was significantly slower and poorer than for children with TLD. Increasing a child’s vocabulary may benefit lexical access.

Abstract = {Noun/verb dissociations in the literature defy interpretation due to the confound between lexical category and semantic meaning; nouns and verbs typically describe concrete objects and actions. Abstract words, pertaining to neither, are a critical test case: dissociations along lexical-grammatical lines would support models purporting lexical category as the principle governing brain organisation, whilst semantic models predict dissociation between concrete words but not abstract items. During fMRI scanning, participants read orthogonalised word categories of nouns and verbs, with or without concrete, sensorimotor meaning. Analysis of inferior frontal/insula, precentral and central areas revealed an interaction between lexical class and semantic factors with clear category differences between concrete nouns and verbs but not abstract ones. Though the brain stores the combinatorial and lexical-grammatical properties of words, our data show that topographical differences in brain activation, especially in the motor system and inferior frontal cortex, are driven by semantics and not by lexical class.

Abstract = {To what extent do toddlers have shared vocabularies? We examined CDI data collected from 14,607 infants and toddlers in five countries and measured the amount of variability between individual lexicons during development for both comprehension and production. Early lexicons are highly overlapping. However, beyond 100 words, toddlers share more words with other toddlers in comprehension than in production, even when matched for lexicon sizes. This finding points to a structural difference in early comprehension and production: Toddlers are generalists in comprehension but develop a unique, expressive voice. Variability in production decreases after two years of age, suggesting convergence to a common expressive core vocabulary. We discuss potential exogenous and endogenous contributions to the inverted U‐shaped development observed in young children's expressive lexical variability.

Abstract = {Despite grammatical class being a fundamental organising principle of the human mental lexicon, recent morphological models of visual word identification remain silent as to whether and how it is represented in the lexical system. The present study addresses this issue by investigating cross-class morphological priming (i.e., the effect obtained when nouns prime verbs sharing the same root or vice versa) to clarify whether morphological stems subserving the formation of both nouns and verbs (e.g., depart-) have a unique, grammatical class–independent representation. Experiments 1 and 2 suggest this to be the case, as they show that morphological priming crosses grammatical class boundaries in overt paradigm conditions. Experiment 3 shows that, in masked priming conditions, cross-class facilitation emerges both for genuine derivations and pseudo-related pairs with a homographic stem (e.g., port-e, doors, and port-are, to carry), which is taken to suggest that grammatical class–free stem representations are located at a pre-lexical level of morphological processing.

The behavioral results revealed robust priming induced by both kinds of radicals. As for the MEG results, the repetition effect of phonetic radicals was obtained in the M170, M250 and M350 components. However, the repetition effect of semantic radicals was only marginally interactive with other variables in the M170, M350 and M450 components. The present findings suggest that phonetic radicals play a predominant role in early lexical access and phonological computation of Chinese character recognition,while semantic radicals have relatively weak effect on lexical access and semantic retrieval.

Abstract = {Models of bilingual reading such as Bilingual Interactive Activation Plus (Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002) do not predict a central role for domain-general executive control during bilingual reading, in contrast with bilingual models from other domains, such as production (e.g., the Inhibitory Control Model; Green, 1998). We thus investigated whether individual differences among bilinguals in domain-general executive control modulate cross-language activation during L2 sentence reading, over and above other factors such as L2 proficiency. Fifty French–English bilinguals read L2-English sentences while their eye movements were recorded, and they subsequently completed a battery of executive control and L2 proficiency tasks. High- and low-constraint sentences contained interlingual homographs (chat = 'casual conversation' in English, 'a cat' in French), cognates (piano in English and French), or L2-specific control words. The results showed that greater executive control among bilinguals but not L2 proficiency reduced cross-language activation in terms of interlingual homograph interference. In contrast, increased L2 proficiency but not executive control reduced cross-language activation in terms of cognate facilitation. These results suggest that models of bilingual reading must incorporate mechanisms by which domain-general executive control can alter the earliest stages of bilingual lexical activation.

Abstract = {The present study aimed to quantify cross-linguistic modulations of the contribution of phonemic awareness skills and visual attention span (VA Span) skills (number of visual elements that can be processed simultaneously) to reading speed and accuracy in 18 Spanish-French balanced bilingual children with and without developmental dyslexia. The children were administered two similar reading batteries in French and Spanish. The deficits of the dyslexic children in reading accuracy were mainly visible in their opaque orthography (French) whereas difficulties indexed by reading speed were observed in both their opaque and transparent orthographies. Dyslexic children did not exhibit any phonemic awareness problems in French or in Spanish, but showed poor VA Span skills compared to their control peers. VA span skills correlated with reading accuracy and speed measures in both Spanish and French, whereas phonemic awareness correlated with reading accuracy only. Overall, the present results show that the VA Span is tightly related to reading speed regardless of orthographic transparency, and that it accounts for differences in reading performance between good and poor readers across languages. The present findings further suggest that VA Span skills may play a particularly important role in building-up specific word knowledge which is critical for lexical reading strategies.

Abstract = {A combination of lexical bias and altered auditory feedback was used to investigate the influence of higher-order linguistic knowledge on the perceptual aspects of speech motor control. Subjects produced monosyllabic real words or pseudo-words containing the vowel [ε] (as in 'head') under conditions of altered auditory feedback involving a decrease in vowel first formant (F1) frequency. This manipulation had the effect of making the vowel sound more similar to [I] (as in 'hid'), affecting the lexical status of produced words in two Lexical-Change (LC) groups (either changing them from real words to pseudo-words: e.g., less—liss, or pseudo-words to real words: e.g., kess—kiss). Two Non-Lexical-Change (NLC) control groups underwent the same auditory feedback manipulation during the production of [ε] real- or pseudo-words, only without any resulting change in lexical status (real words to real words: e.g., mess—miss, or pseudo-words to pseudo-words: e.g., ness—niss). The results from the LC groups indicate that auditory-feedback-based speech motor learning is sensitive to the lexical status of the stimuli being produced, in that speakers tend to keep their acoustic speech outcomes within the auditory-perceptual space corresponding to the task-related side of the word/non-word boundary (real words or pseudo-words). For the NLC groups, however, no such effect of lexical status is observed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a rare clinical dementia syndrome with predominant, progressive language impairment. Clinical symptoms, linguistic impairment and the course of the disease may vary considerably between patients. In order to capture these aspects, longitudinal assessments of neurofunctional changes in PPA including their relationship to behaviour and clinical symptoms are mandatory, ideally at intervals shorter than 1 year. Here, we report a longitudinal fMRI study investigating the development of lexical processing and their neural basis in PPA patients over 1 year. Four logopenic PPA patients and four matched controls were scanned 3 times (T1, T2, T3, at 6 months intervals) while performing a visual lexical decision task on German words and pseudowords. Group differences for the lexicality effect (pseudowords > words) were assessed at time point T1 and its longitudinal changes in the BOLD signal associated with the lexicality effect were analysed. Brain atrophy was assessed with a high-resolution MPRAGE sequence and analysed using deformation based morphometry (DBM). From the very beginning of the study, PPA patients showed reduced left-hemispheric and increased right-hemispheric activations compared to controls. During the progression of the disease, activation increased predominantly in left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and inferior frontal junction area, whereas the same regions decreased in activity in control brains. Interestingly, DBM data showed that this increase in activation in PPA patients was accompanied by progressing atrophy in the same regions. At a behavioural level, the accuracy in the lexical decision task was comparably high for both groups during the whole period of examination, despite some large variability between patients. To conclude, the dissociation between (i) maintained high performance, (ii) increased activity in regions involved in lexical access such as pMTG, and (iii) progressive atrophy of the very same regions supports the notion of a compensatory mechanism in brains of PPA patients for maintaining language while brain atrophy is progressing. The activity increase within a left-lateralised fronto-temporal network seems vital for high-level performance, whereas initial right-hemispheric recruitment of homologue language regions, which is reminiscent of that in vascular aphasics, has no continuous impact on lexical performance.

Abstract = {Disambiguation refers to children’s tendency to assign novel labels to unfamiliar rather than familiar referents. It is employed as a word-learning strategy, but it remains unknown whether it is a domain-specific phenomenon or a manifestation of more general pragmatic competence. To assess the domain-specificity and development of disambiguation, this study tested children from two age groups (ages 3;7–4;6 and 4;7–5;7) and adults on a disambiguation of novel labels and referential facts paradigm. A linear contrast analysis showed that the difference between disambiguation from labels and disambiguation from facts increased significantly as the participants’ age increased. The results indicate that at the early stages of word learning, children reason by exclusion to disambiguate the meaning of a variety of referential actions, but with increasing understanding about the communicative process, this inferential reasoning develops into a strategy limited to lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {Visual cues to the individual segments of speech and to sentence prosody guide speech recognition. The present study tested whether visual suprasegmental cues to the stress patterns of words can also constrain recognition. Dutch listeners use acoustic suprasegmental cues to lexical stress (changes in duration, amplitude, and pitch) in spoken-word recognition. We asked here whether they can also use visual suprasegmental cues. In two categorization experiments, Dutch participants saw a speaker say fragments of word pairs that were segmentally identical but differed in their stress realization (e.g., ˈca-vi from cavia 'guinea pig' vs. ˌka-vi from kaviaar 'caviar'). Participants were able to distinguish between these pairs from seeing a speaker alone. Only the presence of primary stress in the fragment, not its absence, was informative. Participants were able to distinguish visually primary from secondary stress on first syllables, but only when the fragment-bearing target word carried phrase-level emphasis. Furthermore, participants distinguished fragments with primary stress on their second syllable from those with secondary stress on their first syllable (e.g., pro-ˈjec from projector 'projector' vs. ˌpro-jec from projectiel 'projectile'), independently of phrase-level emphasis. Seeing a speaker thus contributes to spoken-word recognition by providing suprasegmental information about the presence of primary lexical stress.

Abstract = {Cross-language comparisons can provide important constraints on our understanding of how people read aloud. French is an interesting case because it differs from most other writing systems in that it uses a large number of multi-letter vowel graphemes and consonants that are systematically silent (i.e., do not map to any lexical phonology; e.g., trop ). Here, we developed a French version of the Connectionist Dual Process Model of Reading Aloud (CDP++) that can handle multisyllabic stimuli (up to three syllables) and has a large-scale lexicon of more than 100,000 words. We tested the model on extant data and an additional experiment examining the reading aloud of nonwords with potentially silent letters. The results from the extant data showed that the model was able to capture a number of important psycholinguistic effects in the literature and explained between 52% and 67% of the item-specific variance in two large databases. The results of the silent-letter experiment showed that, contrary to what would be predicted on the basis of lexical database statistics, people generally pronounce 'silent' consonants in nonwords. We show that the French CDP++ model faithfully predicted this effect because it implements a linear mapping between orthography and phonology. These findings highlight the theoretical and practical significance of using computational models to help determine the processes and representations that underlie skilled reading.

Abstract = {The lexical representation of words in Indo-European languages is generally assumed to be driven by meaning compositionality. This study examined the lexical representation of complex verbs in German, which is a morphologically rich representative of Indo-European languages. Three overt priming experiments manipulated prime–target relations between morphological, semantic, and form relatedness. Base verbs (e.g., binden, ‘bind’) were preceded by derivations that were semantically related (zubinden, ‘tie’) or semantically unrelated (entbinden, ‘deliver’), by purely semantically related (zuschnüren, ‘tie’), form-related (abbilden, ‘depict’), or unrelated (abholzen, ‘deforest’) verbs. To ensure that the procedures were sensitive to semantic and form processing, semantic associates (Messer–Gabel, ‘knife–fork’) and form controls (Bordell–Bord, ‘brothel–board’; beschreiben–reiben, ‘describe–rub’) were added in Experiment 3. To examine whether lexical representation is affected by modality, prime presentation was further varied between visual (Exp. 1 and 3) and auditory (Exp. 2). Semantic facilitation (Exp. 3) and form inhibition (Exp. 2 and 3) were not reliable across experiments, while morphological facilitation was strong and unaffected by semantic relatedness in all three experiments. That is, the priming from semantically opaque derivations was equivalent to that from transparent derivations. These findings indicate that the lexical representation of complex verbs refers to the base regardless of meaning compositionality. Lexical representations in German thus differ from those in other Indo-European languages. This new evidence points to the necessity to encompass cross-linguistic variations in the modeling of lexical representation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Watching a speaker say words benefits subsequent auditory recognition of the same words. In this study, we tested whether hearing words also facilitates subsequent phonological processing from visual speech, and if so, whether speaker repetition influences the magnitude of this word repetition priming. We used long-term cross-modal repetition priming as a means to investigate the underlying lexical representations involved in listening to and seeing speech. In Experiment 1, listeners identified auditory-only words during exposure and visual-only words at test. Words at test were repeated or new and produced by the exposure speaker or a novel speaker. Results showed a significant effect of cross-modal word repetition priming but this was unaffected by speaker changes. Experiment 2 added an explicit recognition task at test. Listeners’ lipreading performance was again improved by prior exposure to auditory words. Explicit recognition memory was poor, and neither word repetition nor speaker repetition improved it. This suggests that cross-modal repetition priming is neither mediated by explicit memory nor improved by speaker information. Our results suggest that phonological representations in the lexicon are shared across auditory and visual processing, and that speaker information is not transferred across modalities at the lexical level.

Here, we investigated such arbitrary conceptual relationships using a non-linguistic picture relatedness task in participants undergoing event-related brain potential recordings. Picture pairs arbitrarily related because of a compound and presented in the compound order elicited N400 amplitudes similar to unrelated pairs. Surprisingly, however, pictures presented in the reverse order (as in the sequence horse–sea) reduced N400 amplitudes significantly, demonstrating the existence of a link in memory between these two concepts otherwise unrelated. These results break new ground in the domain of linguistic relativity by revealing predicted semantic associations driven by lexical relations intrinsic to language.

Abstract = {It has been claimed that the long established neutralization of the voicing distinction in domain final position in German is phonetically incomplete. However, many studies that have advanced this claim have subsequently been criticized on methodological grounds, calling incomplete neutralization into question. In three production experiments and one perception experiment we address these methodological criticisms. In the first production study, we address the role of orthography. In a large scale auditory task using pseudowords, we confirm that neutralization is indeed incomplete and suggest that previous null results may simply be due to lack of statistical power. In two follow-up production studies (Experiments 2 and 3), we rule out a potential confound of Experiment 1, namely that the effect might be due to accommodation to the presented auditory stimuli, by manipulating the duration of the preceding vowel. While the between-items design (Experiment 2) replicated the findings of Experiment 1, the between-subjects version (Experiment 3) failed to find a statistically significant incomplete neutralization effect, although we found numerical tendencies in the expected direction. Finally, in a perception study (Experiment 4), we demonstrate that the subphonemic differences between final voiceless and 'devoiced' stops are audible, but only barely so. Even though the present findings provide evidence for the robustness of incomplete neutralization in German, the small effect sizes highlight the challenges of investigating this phenomenon. We argue that without necessarily postulating functional relevance, incomplete neutralization can be accounted for by recent models of lexical organization.

Abstract = {This study investigates the possible influence of lexical co-occurrence on lexical ambiguity resolution in sentence contexts. Lexical co-occurrence refers to similarity between the co-occurrence vectors of words, such that if two words have similar profiles of occurrence with other words, they are said to have a strong co-occurrence relationship. The present study examines whether lexical ambiguity resolution can be biased by the prior presentation of a word that shares a strong co-occurrence relationship with an ambiguous word under one of its meanings, despite the absence of plausibility support. Two 'maze' word-by-word reading experiments examined highly implausible/anomalous sentences with balanced homographs. In sentences in which the ambiguous word (e.g., bat) was preceded by a biasing word with which it shares a strong co-occurrence relationship (e.g., umpire), (1) response times (RTs) to the ambiguous word were facilitated, and (2) garden-path effects were found when subsequent (disambiguating) information was incongruent with the biased meaning (e.g., The umpire tried to swallow the bat but its wings got stuck in his throat). Additional experiments showed that these biasing effects resist explanation in terms of a passive process of spreading activation. Furthermore, an eye-tracking experiment revealed a pattern of results comparable to that of the maze task experiments, indicating that these effects are not artefacts of the maze procedure. These results are taken to support a heuristic for lexical ambiguity resolution that is driven by relatively low-level intralexical connections based on lexical co-occurrence.

Abstract = {We describe the case of a dysgraphic aphasic individual—S.G.W.—who, in writing to dictation, produced high rates of formally related errors consisting of both lexical substitutions and what we call morphological-compound errors involving legal or illegal combinations of morphemes. These errors were produced in the context of a minimal number of semantic errors. We could exclude problems with phonological discrimination and phonological short-term memory. We also excluded rapid decay of lexical information and/or weak activation of word forms and letter representations since S.G.W.'s spelling showed no effect of delay and no consistent length effects, but, instead, paradoxical complexity effects with segmental, lexical, and morphological errors that were more complex than the target. The case of S.G.W. strongly resembles that of another dysgraphic individual reported in the literature—D.W.—suggesting that this pattern of errors can be replicated across patients. In particular, both patients show unusual errors resulting in the production of neologistic compounds (e.g., 'bed button' in response to 'bed'). These patterns can be explained if we accept two claims: (a) Brain damage can produce both a reduction and an increase in lexical activation; and (b) there are direct connections between phonological and orthographic lexical representations (a third spelling route). We suggest that both patients are suffering from a difficulty of lexical selection resulting from excessive activation of formally related lexical representations. This hypothesis is strongly supported by S.G.W.'s worse performance in spelling to dictation than in written naming, which shows that a phonological input, activating a cohort of formally related lexical representations, increases selection difficulties.

Abstract = {A crucial step for understanding how lexical knowledge is represented is to describe the relative similarity of lexical items, and how it influences language processing. Previous studies of the effects of form similarity on word production have reported conflicting results, notably within and across languages. The aim of the present study was to clarify this empirical issue to provide specific constraints for theoretical models of language production. We investigated the role of phonological neighborhood density in a large-scale picture naming experiment using fine-grained statistical models. The results showed that increasing phonological neighborhood density has a detrimental effect on naming latencies, and re-analyses of independently obtained data sets provide supplementary evidence for this effect. Finally, we reviewed a large body of evidence concerning phonological neighborhood density effects in word production, and discussed the occurrence of facilitatory and inhibitory effects in accuracy measures. The overall pattern shows that phonological neighborhood generates two opposite forces, one facilitatory and one inhibitory. In cases where speech production is disrupted (e.g. certain aphasic symptoms), the facilitatory component may emerge, but inhibitory processes dominate in efficient naming by healthy speakers. These findings are difficult to accommodate in terms of monitoring processes, but can be explained within interactive activation accounts combining phonological facilitation and lexical competition.

Abstract = {In two experiments, we demonstrate that error-related negativities (ERNs) recorded during spelling decisions can expose individual differences in lexical knowledge. The first experiment found that the ERN was elicited during spelling decisions and that its magnitude was correlated with independent measures of subjects' spelling knowledge. In the second experiment, we manipulated the phonology of misspelled stimuli and observed that ERN magnitudes were larger when misspelled words altered the phonology of their correctly spelled counterparts than when they preserved it. Thus, when an error is made in a decision about spelling, the brain processes indexed by the ERN reflect both phonological and orthographic input to the decision process. In both experiments, ERN effect sizes were correlated with assessments of lexical knowledge and reading, including offline spelling ability and spelling-mediated vocabulary knowledge. These results affirm the interdependent nature of orthographic, semantic, and phonological knowledge components while showing that spelling knowledge uniquely influences the ERN during spelling decisions. Finally, the study demonstrates the value of ERNs in exposing individual differences in lexical knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This paper discusses computer-based resources for lexical data and their uses. First, the kinds of lexical data available are described, including those related to form (spelling, pronunciation, inflection, word class), meaning (definition/equivalent, synonyms/antonyms/hyperonyms, thesaurus classification), context (grammatical collocations, lexical collocations, idioms, valency), and pragmatics (distribution, frequency). Different forms in which lexical data are collected are examined, including: word frequency lists; printed dictionaries in machine-readable form, with and without linguistic codes and classification; machine lexicons; lexical databases; and computational linguistics lexicons. The paper then notes the resources available or in production through the  Trans-European Language Resources Infrastructure. Finally, areas in which lexical resources can be used are sketched, including lexical research itself, field-specific research, lexicography, creation of writing aids (spell and style checkers), computer aided translation, language instruction, and information retrieval and artificial intelligence.

Abstract = {Considering the popularity of the Internet, an automatic interactive feedback system for E-learning websites is becoming increasingly desirable. However, computers still have problems understanding natural languages, especially the Chinese language, firstly because the Chinese language has no space to segment lexical entries (its segmentation method is more difficult than that of English) and secondly because of the lack of a complete grammar in the Chinese language, making parsing more difficult and complicated. Building an automated Chinese feedback system for special application domains could solve these problems. This paper proposes an interactive feedback mechanism in a virtual campus that can parse, understand and respond to Chinese sentences. This mechanism utilizes a specific lexical database according to the particular application. In this way, a virtual campus website can implement a special application domain that chooses the proper response in a user friendly, accurate and timely manner.

Due to the information overload and its varieties in discussion groups, it is difficult to draw out the relevant information. Therefore, recommender systems play an important role in filtering and customizing the desired information. Nowadays, collaborative and content-based filtering are the most adopted techniques being utilized in recommender systems. The collaborative filtering technique recommends items based on liked-mind users’ opinions and users’ preferences. Alternatively, the aim of the content-based filtering technique is the identification of items which are similar to those a user has preferred in past.

Further investigations indicate that the development of a lightweight ontological technique using existing lexical database for English (WordNet) is able to check the similarity of data records and detect the correct data region with higher precision using the semantic properties of these data records. The advantages of this method are that it can extract three types of data records, namely, single-section data records, multiple-section data records, and loosely structured data records, and it also provides options for aligning iterative and disjunctive data items. Experimental results show that our technique is robust and performs better than the existing state-of-the-art wrappers. Tests also show that our wrapper is able to extract data records from multilingual web pages and that it is domain independent. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLIS)},

Abstract = {Using eye-tracking as a window on cognitive processing, this study investigates language effects on attention to motion events in a non-verbal task. We compare gaze allocation patterns by native speakers of German and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), two languages that differ with regard to the grammaticalization of temporal concepts. Findings of the non-verbal task, in which speakers watch dynamic event scenes while performing an auditory distracter task, are compared to gaze allocation patterns which were obtained in an event description task, using the same stimuli. We investigate whether differences in the grammatical aspectual systems of German and MSA affect the extent to which endpoints of motion events are linguistically encoded and visually processed in the two tasks. In the linguistic task, we find clear language differences in endpoint encoding and in the eye-tracking data (attention to event endpoints) as well: German speakers attend to and linguistically encode endpoints more frequently than speakers of MSA. The fixation data in the non-verbal task show similar language effects, providing relevant insights with regard to the language-and-thought debate. The present study is one of the few studies that focus explicitly on language effects related to grammatical concepts, as opposed to lexical concepts.

Abstract = {Lexical access tasks are designed to measure efficiency of lexical access, but task demands and methods vary greatly. Many lexical access tasks do not account for confounding factors including competence in other linguistic abilities. In this study, preschoolers were given two lexical access tasks. In the single-category naming (SCN) task, children rapidly named animals. In the multi-category naming (MCN) task, children named one item from each of 10 categories. Children were also tested on vocabulary, syntax, and articulation. First, scores on each task increase with age. Second, the two lexical access scores were only moderately correlated, suggesting that different ‘lexical access’ tasks measure different abilities. Finally, we compared scores on each of the lexical access tasks with scores on the other linguistic tasks, demonstrating that different linguistic abilities are involved in each task at different ages. Results suggest that even very similar tasks capture different aspects of lexical access, and that the SCN task is a purer lexical access test.

Abstract = {This mixed-method exploratory study investigated vocabulary development trajectories of an emergent bilingual child who was an English language learner (ELL) in a Universal Pre-K classroom. The focal child was born to an immigrant family from Turkey. The dominant home language was Turkish (L1). Despite two years of environmental exposure, preschool classroom was the first instructionally-mediated context in which he was systematically exposed to the English language (L2). Investigation began when he started preschool at 4:5 years of age and ended when he finished at 5:1 years of age. Thus, the child's vocabulary development was examined longitudinally across 9 months of preschool year. Grounded in sociocultural theory of learning (Vygotsky, 1978) and supported by the MOM framework for language acquisition (Kohnert, 2009), the study investigated trajectories of vocabulary development from three major perspectives: (1) linguistic, (2) instructional, and (3) socio-interactional. Data were collected through 72 classroom visits that equaled more than 100 hours of participant observation. The focal child's language use and interactions with teachers and peers were videotaped in the contexts of circle-time, teacher-guided small-group table activities, freeplay time, snack time, and field visits. The study yielded over 120 video-clips with an average length of 7 minutes. Additional data sources included pre- and post- assessments of the child's receptive (PPVT) and expressive (EVT) vocabulary knowledge, interviews with classroom teachers, parents, and the focal child, member-checking sessions with teachers, and vocabulary-related artifacts (e.g., concept word drawings). Pre-analysis work focused on generating a corpus of the child's baseline expressive lexicon in the L2 and a comprehensive word learning and production database that documented each lexical item he learned and produced throughout the year along with a variety of supporting linguistic and contextual information as to how the word occurred, the topic of interaction in which the word originated, patterns in picking up and expressively using the word, incidental word-meaning derivation inferences, pronunciation, semantic, and pragmatic aspects of word usage, and incrementality and permanency of vocabulary gains. Focalizing each word on the database as the unit of micro-level discourse analyses, the study yielded rich insights with regards to the trajectories by which the child supported his L2 vocabulary development. Linguistic Perspective: The child's vocabulary learning and production frequency gradually increased throughout the academic year; starting with a receptive period, continuing with a rapid expressive L2 development. The spring semester was marked with a vocabulary spurt during which the child's L2 productions enhanced in three primary domains: (1) pronunciation patterns, (2) morphosyntactic accuracy, and (3) semantic coherence and sophistication in vocabulary usage. The lexical composition of his expressive vocabulary repertoire was characterized by noun preponderance throughout the year. Emergence of adverb and preposition words in the expressive repertoire was the latest in developing relative to other categories. The child's semantic vocabulary development was conditioned by imageability and concreteness of words. Depth of word-meaning understanding patterns he demonstrated spanned across a continuum of no/incorrect word knowledge to complex expressive word knowledge. PPVT and EVT scores pointed to equally-developed receptive and expressive global vocabulary knowledge at the beginning of preschool, whereas the former surpassed the latter at the end of the year, rendering a receptive-expressive vocabulary gap. Cross-linguistic trajectories suggested the phenomena of lexical transfer from L1 to L2, intra-utterance and inter-utterance code-switching to fill lexical gaps, L1-L2 phoneme correspondence facto… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Four eye-tracking experiments were conducted to understand how sentential context and lexical factors affect word recognition during reading. Experiment 1 examined whether readers use preceding sentential context to pre-activate a specific word and whether any processing cost is found when the prediction is wrong. The results showed that readers obtain a processing benefit when the target word was expected based on a strongly constraining context, whereas they experienced a processing cost when the target word was not the expected one even though it was semantically plausible into the context. Experiment 2 investigated how word recognition is influenced by prior activation of lexical information due to word repetition within a sentence. The result showed that gaze duration on a target word with many neighbor words was shorter relative to a target word with few neighbors but only when the target word was repeated; when the target word was not repeated gaze duration did not differ as a function of neighborhood size. This interaction indicates that word recognition at the orthographic level can be influenced by repetition-induced lexical activation. The null effect of the orthographic neighborhood size in the unrepeated condition was unexpected. Previous studies using the lexical-decision task have consistently shown a facilitative effect of orthographic neighborhood size. Therefore, Experiment 3 and 4 studied the role of neighborhood size during sentence reading with better controlled stimuli. The results showed an opposite pattern of results between gaze duration and word skipping such that gaze duration was longer when a word had many neighbors than when one had few neighbors, whereas skipping rates were higher in the many neighbor condition than in the few condition. The results indicate that having many neighbor words inhibits processes responsible for precise recognition of a word, but that it facilitates word skipping by increasing global lexical activity.

Abstract = {How does experience influence children’s acquisition of word meanings? In this chapter, the authors discuss the evidence from two bodies of literature that take different perspectives to answer this question. First, they review evidence from the 'experience' literature, which has demonstrated that different experiential factors (e.g., differences in the quantity and quality of maternal speech) are related to individual differences in children’s early vocabularies. Although the results of the studies within this literature are interesting, the authors argue that they do not clarify how experience influences children’s vocabulary development. They posit that this question can best be answered by marrying the 'experience' literature and the 'cognitive' literature, which has identified the skills and knowledge that children possess that help them determine the meanings of words. The authors demonstrate how integrating both literatures will provide a valuable framework from which research can be designed and hypotheses tested. In doing so, their framework will provide a comprehensive understanding of how experience influences children’s lexical development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The architecture of writing systems metaphor has special relevance for understanding the structural nature of the Japanese writing system, and, more specifically, for appreciating how the 2,136 kanji of the jō-yō-kanji- hyō/ ‘List of characters for general use’ function as the core building blocks in the orthographic representation of a considerable proportion of the Japanese lexicon. In seeking to illuminate the multiple layers of internal structure within Japanese kanji, the Japanese lexicon, and the Japanese writing system, the paper draws on insights and observations gained from an ongoing project to construct a large-scale Japanese lexical database system. Reflecting structural distinctions within the database, the paper consists of three main sections addressing the different structural levels of kanji components, jōyō kanji, and the lexicon.

Abstract = {Korean has a number of grammatical devices to introduce topics into the discourse. Among such markers is a paradigm of periphrastic topic presenters that are built on rhetorical questions, bringing micro-level topics into the discourse. The major strategy involved in the development of these topic presenters is feigning interactivity, whereby the speaker rhetorically asks a hypothetical question on behalf of the addressee and then answers it. This rhetorical question strategy is an intriguing discourse manipulation to create an engaging effect in that what the speaker pursues from the addressee is not a verbal response, i.e. reply, but a cognitive response, i.e. attention. A historical investigation reveals a number of important implications in grammaticalization studies. For instance, the grammaticalization process of these innovative topic markers creates a template-like paradigm of periphrastic constructions that contain slots to be filled in from another grammatical paradigm of interrogative pronouns and adverbs. Furthermore, the historical developmental pattern of the emerging paradigm strongly suggests that the formative process is enabled by analogy. In addition, the directionality of the process is from the domain of discourse, i.e. rhetoric, contra most traditional instances that undergo the process proceeding from lexical domain to grammatical domain.

Abstract = {In spoken French, the phonological processes of liaison and resyllabification can render word and syllable boundaries ambiguous (e.g., unair 'an air'/un nerf 'a nerve,' both [ε.nɛʁ]). Production data have demonstrated that speakers of French vary the duration of consonants that surface in liaison environments relative to consonants produced word initially. Further research has suggested that listeners exploit these durational differences in the processing of running speech, although no study to date has directly tested this hypothesis. The current study examines the exploitation of duration in word recognition processes by manipulating this single acoustic factor while holding all other factors in the signal constant. The pivotal consonants in potentially ambiguous French sequences (e.g., /n/ in unnerf) were instrumentally shortened and lengthened and presented to listeners in two behavioral tasks. The results suggest that listeners are sensitive to segmental duration and use this information to modulate the lexical interpretation of spoken French.

Abstract = {While the referent of a nonreflexive pronoun clearly depends on context, the nature of these contextual restrictions is controversial. The present study seeks to characterise one representation that guides pronoun resolution. Our focus is an effect known as 'implicit causality'. In causal dependant clauses, the preferred referent of a pronoun varies systematically with the verb in the main clause (contrast Sally frightened Mary because she … with Sally feared Mary because she…). A number of researchers have tried to explain and predict such biases with reference to semantic classes of verbs. However, such studies have focused on a small number of specially selected verbs. In Experiment 1, we find that existing taxonomies perform near chance at predicting pronoun-resolution bias on a large set of representative verbs. However, a more fine-grained taxonomy recently proposed in the linguistics literature does significantly better. In Experiment 2, we tested all 264 verbs in two of the narrowly defined verb classes from this new taxonomy, finding that pronoun-resolution biases were categorically different. These findings suggest that the semantic structure of verbs tightly constrains the interpretation of pronouns in causal sentences, raising challenges for theories which posit that implicit causality biases reflect world knowledge or arbitrary lexical features.

Abstract = {In the past decades, hundreds of articles have explored the mechanisms underlying priming. Most researchers assume that masked and unmasked priming are qualitatively different. For masked priming, the effects are often assumed to reflect savings in the encoding of the target stimulus, whereas for unmasked priming, it has been suggested that the effects reflect the familiarity of the prime–target compound cue. In contrast, other researchers have claimed that masked and unmasked priming reflect essentially the same core processes. In this article, we use the diffusion model (R. Ratcliff, 1978, A theory of memory retrieval, Psychological Review, Vol. 85, pp. 59–108) to account for the effects of masked and unmasked priming for identity and associatively related primes. The fits of the model led us to the following conclusion: Masked related primes give a head start to the processing of the target compared with unrelated primes, whereas unmasked priming affects primarily the quality of the lexical information.

Abstract = {Previous studies have investigated orthographic-to-phonological mapping during reading by comparing brain activation for (1) reading words to object naming, or (2) reading pseudowords (e.g., 'phume') to words (e.g., 'plume'). Here we combined both approaches to provide new insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. In fMRI data from 25 healthy adult readers, we first identified activation that was greater for reading words and pseudowords relative to picture and color naming. The most significant effect was observed in the left putamen, extending to both anterior and posterior borders. Second, consistent with previous studies, we show that both the anterior and posterior putamen are involved in articulating speech with greater activation during our overt speech production tasks (reading, repetition, object naming, and color naming) than silent one-back-matching on the same stimuli. Third, we compared putamen activation for words versus pseudowords during overt reading and auditory repetition. This revealed that the anterior putamen was most activated by reading pseudowords, whereas the posterior putamen was most activated by words irrespective of whether the task was reading words or auditory word repetition. The pseudoword effect in the anterior putamen is consistent with prior studies that associated this region with the initiation of novel sequences of movements. In contrast, the heightened word response in the posterior putamen is consistent with other studies that associated this region with 'memory guided movement.' Our results illustrate how the functional dissociation between the anterior and posterior putamen supports sublexical and lexical processing during reading.

Abstract = {Experiments involving blocked and continuous manipulations of the semantic naming context demonstrate that, when speakers name several taxonomically related objects in close succession, they display persistent interference effects. A review of studies using the blocked paradigm shows that, unlike the continuous paradigm, it typically does not induce cumulative interference effects in healthy speakers. This contrasts with the simulation results obtained from a model of semantic context effects recently put forward by Oppenheim and colleagues [Oppenheim, G. M., Dell, G. S., & Schwartz, M. F. (2010). The dark side of incremental learning: A model of cumulative semantic interference during lexical access in speech production. Cognition, 114, 227–262], which generates cumulative effects in both paradigms. We propose that the effects are non-cumulative in the blocked paradigm, because it allows participants to bias top-down the levels of activation of lexical-semantic representations, thereby curtailing the accumulating interference. Indeed, prior research has shown that the interference effects in the blocked paradigm are exacerbated when participants carry out a concurrent digit-retention task, loading on working memory and reducing their capacity to exert a top-down bias. In Experiment 1, combining the continuous paradigm with a digit-retention task, we demonstrate that this does not exacerbate cumulative context effects, corroborating the selective role of working memory and the associated top-down biasing mechanism in the blocked paradigm. A review of neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies demonstrates that left inferior frontal regions may play a critical role in controlling semantic interference top-down. We discuss the implications of these findings for language production research and for models of lexical-semantic encoding. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: To compare the efficacy and cognitive side effects of high-dose unilateral brief pulse electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with those of high-dose unilateral ultrabrief pulse ECT in the treatment of major depression. Method: From April 2007 until March 2011, we conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized multicenter trial in 3 tertiary psychiatric hospitals. All patients with a depressive disorder according to DSM-IV criteria were eligible. Depression severity was assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale; primary efficacy outcomes were response, defined as a score decrease ≥ 60% from baseline, and remission, defined as a score < 10 at 2 consecutive weekly assessments. Total scores on the Autobiographical Memory Interview and Amsterdam Media Questionnaire were the primary outcome measures for retrograde amnesia. Other cognitive domains included category fluency (semantic memory) and letter fluency (lexical memory). Patients received twice weekly unilateral brief pulse (1.0 millisecond) or ultrabrief pulse (0.3-0.4 millisecond) ECT 8 times seizure threshold until remission, for a maximum of 6 weeks. Results: Of the 116 patients, 75% (n = 87) completed the study. Among completers, 68.4% (26/58) of those in the brief pulse group achieved remission versus 49.0% (24/49) of those in the ultrabrief pulse group (P = .019), and the brief pulse group needed fewer treatment sessions to achieve remission: mean (SD) of 7.1 (2.6) versus 9.2 (2.3) sessions (P = .008). No significant group differences were found in the evaluation of the cognitive assessments. Conclusions: The efficacy and speed of remission seen with high-dose brief pulse right unilateral ECT twice weekly were superior to those seen with high-dose ultrabrief pulse right unilateral ECT, with equal cognitive side effects as defined by retrograde amnesia, semantic memory, and lexical memory.

Abstract = {Relatively little is known about the time course of access to the lexical representations of verbs in agrammatic aphasia and its effects on the prediction and integration of the verb’s arguments. The present study used visual-world eyetracking to test whether verb meaning can be used by agrammatic aphasic individuals to predict and facilitate the integration of a subsequent noun argument. Nine adults with agrammatic aphasia and ten age-matched controls participated in the study. In Experiment 1, participants viewed arrays of four objects (e.g., jar, plate, stick, pencil) while listening to sentences containing either a restrictive verb that was semantically compatible only with the target object or an unrestrictive verb compatible with all four objects (e.g., Susan will open/break the jar). For both participant groups, the restrictive condition elicited more fixations to the target object immediately after the verb. Experiment 2 differed from Experiment 1 in that the auditory sentences presented were incomplete (e.g., Susan will open/break the.). For controls, restrictive verbs elicited more target fixations immediately after the verb; however, the effects of verb type were noted downstream from the verb for the aphasic listeners. The results suggest that individuals with agrammatic aphasia have preserved ability to use verb information to facilitate integration of overt arguments, but prediction of upcoming arguments is impaired. Impaired lexical-semantic prediction processes may be caused by damage to the left inferior frontal gyrus, which has been argued to support higher-level lexical processes.

Abstract = {At about 7 months of age, infants listen longer to sentences containing familiar words – but not deviant pronunciations of familiar words (Jusczyk & Aslin, 1995). This finding suggests that infants are able to segment familiar words from fluent speech and that they store words in sufficient phonological detail to recognize deviations from a familiar word. This finding does not examine whether it is, nevertheless, easier for infants to segment words from sentences when these words sound similar to familiar words. Across three experiments, the present study investigates whether familiarity with a word helps infants segment similar‐sounding words from fluent speech and if they are able to discriminate these similar‐sounding words from other words later on. Results suggest that word‐form familiarity may be a powerful tool bootstrapping further lexical acquisition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Research suggests that word learning is an extended process, with offline consolidation crucial for the strengthening of new lexical representations and their integration with existing lexical knowledge (as measured by engagement in lexical competition). This supports a dual memory systems account, in which new information is initially sparsely encoded separately from existing knowledge and integrated with long-term memory over time. However, previous studies of this type exploited unnatural learning contexts, involving fictitious words in the absence of word meaning. In this study, 5- to 9-year-old children learned real science words (e.g., hippocampus) with or without semantic information. Children in both groups were slower to detect pauses in familiar competitor words (e.g., hippopotamus) relative to control words 24h after training but not immediately, confirming that offline consolidation is required before new words are integrated with the lexicon and engage in lexical competition. Children recalled more new words 24h after training than immediately (with similar improvements shown for the recall and recognition of new word meanings); however, children who were exposed to the meanings during training showed further improvements in recall after 1 week and outperformed children who were not exposed to meanings. These findings support the dual memory systems account of vocabulary acquisition and suggest that the association of a new phonological form with semantic information is critical for the development of stable lexical representations.

Abstract = {The role of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) in speech monitoring has not been delineated. Recent work suggests that medial frontal cortex (MFC) is involved in overt speech monitoring initiated before auditory feedback. This mechanism is reflected in an event-related potential (ERP), the error negativity (Ne), peaking within 100 ms after vocal-onset. Critically, in healthy individuals the Ne is sensitive to the accuracy of the response; it is larger for error than correct trials. By contrast, patients with LPFC damage are impaired in non-verbal monitoring tasks showing no amplitude difference between the Ne measured in correct vs. error trials. Interactions between the LPFC and the MFC are assumed to play a necessary role for normal action monitoring. We investigated whether the LPFC was involved in speech monitoring to the same extent as in non-linguistic actions by comparing performance and EEG activity in patients with LPFC damage and in aged-matched controls performing linguistic (Picture Naming) and non-linguistic (Simon) tasks. Controls did not produce enough errors to allow the comparison of the Ne or other ERP in error vs. correct trials. PFC patients had worse performance than controls in both tasks, but their Ne was larger for error than correct trials only in Naming. This task-dependent pattern can be explained by LPFC-dependent working-memory requirements present in non-linguistic tasks used to study action monitoring but absent in picture naming. This suggests that LPFC may not be necessary for speech monitoring as assessed by simple picture naming. In addition, bilateral temporal cortex activity starting before and peaking around vocal-onset was observed in LPFC and control groups in both tasks but was larger for error than correct trials only in Naming, suggesting the temporal cortex is associated with on-line monitoring of speech specifically when access to lexical representations is necessary.

Abstract = {Knowledge on the patterns of repetition amongst individuals who develop language deficits in association with right hemisphere lesions (crossed aphasia) is very limited. Available data indicate that repetition in some crossed aphasics experiencing phonological processing deficits is not heavily influenced by lexical-semantic variables (lexicality, imageability, and frequency) as is regularly reported in phonologically-impaired cases with left hemisphere damage. Moreover, in view of the fact that crossed aphasia is rare, information on the role of right cortical areas and white matter tracts underpinning language repetition deficits is scarce. In this study, repetition performance was assessed in two patients with crossed conduction aphasia and striatal/capsular vascular lesions encompassing the right arcuate fasciculus (AF) and inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), the temporal stem and the white matter underneath the supramarginal gyrus. Both patients showed lexicality effects repeating better words than non-words, but manipulation of other lexical-semantic variables exerted less influence on repetition performance. Imageability and frequency effects, production of meaning-based paraphrases during sentence repetition, or better performance on repeating novel sentences than overlearned clichés were hardly ever observed in these two patients. In one patient, diffusion tensor imaging disclosed damage to the right long direct segment of the AF and IFOF with relative sparing of the anterior indirect and posterior segments of the AF, together with fully developed left perisylvian white matter pathways. These findings suggest that striatal/capsular lesions extending into the right AF and IFOF in some individuals with right hemisphere language dominance are associated with atypical repetition patterns which might reflect reduced interactions between phonological and lexical-semantic processes.

Abstract = {When the auditory information is deteriorated by noise in a conversation, watching the face of a speaker enhances speech intelligibility. Recent findings indicate that decoding the facial movements of a speaker accelerates word recognition. The objective of this study was to provide evidence that the mere presentation of the first two phonemes—that is, the articulatory gestures of the initial syllable—is enough visual information to activate a lexical unit and initiate the lexical access process. We used a priming paradigm combined with a lexical decision task. The primes were syllables that either shared the initial syllable with an auditory target or not. In Experiment 1, the primes were displayed in audiovisual, auditory-only or visual-only conditions. There was a priming effect in all conditions. Experiment 2 investigated the locus (prelexical vs. lexical or postlexical) of the facilitation effect observed in the visual-only condition by manipulating the target’s word frequency. The facilitation produced by the visual prime was significant for low-frequency words but not for high-frequency words, indicating that the locus of the effect is not prelexical. This suggests that visual speech mostly contributes to the word recognition process when lexical access is difficult. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The idea that correspondences relating grammatical relations and semantics (argument structure constructions) are needed to account for simple sentence types is reviewed, clarified, updated and compared with two lexicalist alternatives. Traditional lexical rules take one verb as ‘input’ and create (or relate) a different verb as ‘output’. More recently, invisible derivational verb templates have been proposed, which treat argument structure patterns as zero derivational affixes that combine with a root verb to yield a new verb. While the derivational template perspective can address several problems that arise for traditional lexical rules, it still faces problems in accounting for idioms, which often contain specifications that are not appropriately assigned to individual verbs or derivational affixes (regarding adjuncts, modification, and inflection). At the same time, it is clear that verbs play a central role in determining their distribution. The balance between verbs and phrasal argument structure constructions is addressed via the Principles of Semantic Coherence and Correspondence together with a usage‐based hierarchy of constructions that contains entries which can include particular verbs and other lexical material.

Abstract = {The current study examined five- and seven-year-old Mandarin-speaking children's processing of lexical tones in relation to speech segments by varying onset and rime in an oddity task (onset ± rime±). Results showed that children experienced more difficulty in lexical tone oddity judgment when rimes differed across monosyllables (e.g. onset + rime —) than when onsets differed (e.g. onset − rime+). This finding suggests that vowels interfere more than consonants in lexical tone processing. Seven-year-olds consistently outperformed five-year olds, suggesting that the growth of metalinguistic awareness and literacy exposure may play a joint role in the development of lexical tone processing skills.

Abstract = {This study investigated the processes underlying the effect of masked syllable priming in French with pseudoword primes and word targets. Two lexical-decision task (LDT) experiments examined whether the syllable priming effect depends on syllable frequency and might rely on a general abstract structure. The results of Experiment 1 revealed an inhibitory priming effect, with pseudoword primes and word targets sharing a high-frequency first syllable, which was not due to the abstract syllable structure. In contrast, no inhibition was observed with a low-frequency first syllable in Experiment 2. Syllable frequency appears to be an important factor determining the speed of target processing in masked priming. This is attributed to variations in the respective contributions of sublexical activation and lexical inhibition processes.

Abstract = {In psychotherapy, co-construction refers to the proposal that the therapist and the client(s), in their dialogue, collaboratively create what emerges in their session. We trace the development of co-construction from its origins in postmodernism and point out that, unfortunately, it has remained more theoretical than practical or observable. The primary thesis of this article is that the microanalysis of video-recorded therapy sessions can render observable the details of how psychotherapists contribute to co-construction in any therapy session. Moreover, there is basic research on the microanalysis of face-to-face dialogue that applies directly to the understanding of co-construction in therapeutic dialogues. We demonstrate these proposals with an overview of the recent and growing body of empirical research on microanalysis of psychotherapy sessions. A detailed example from a therapy session illustrates four key aspects of co-construction: grounding between therapist and client(s), therapist’s questions, therapist’s formulations, and therapist’s lexical choices.

Abstract = {All languages use individually meaningless, contrastive categories in combination to create distinct words. Despite their central role in communication, these 'phoneme' contrasts can be lost over the course of language change. The century-old functional load hypothesis proposes that loss of a phoneme contrast will be inhibited in relation to the work that it does in distinguishing words. In a previous work we showed for the first time that a simple measure of functional load does significantly predict patterns of contrast loss within a diverse set of languages: the more minimal word pairs that a phoneme contrast distinguishes, the less likely those phonemes are to have merged over the course of language change. Here, we examine several lexical properties that are predicted to influence the uncertainty between word pairs in usage. We present evidence that (a) the lemma rather than surface-form count of minimal pairs is more predictive of merger; (b) the count of minimal lemma pairs that share a syntactic category is a stronger predictor of merger than the count of those with divergent syntactic categories, and (c) that the count of minimal lemma pairs with members of similar frequency is a stronger predictor of merger than that of those with more divergent frequencies. These findings support the broad hypothesis that properties of individual utterances influence long-term language change, and are consistent with findings suggesting that phonetic cues are modulated in response to lexical uncertainty within utterances.

We compare 'urban sojourners' (Bequians who have been away) with their home village norms. We observe differences in the frequency of the type of existential preferred in different villages and by the urban sojourners. We also observe differences in whether or not the main verb agrees in number with a postposed plural subject. Building on William Labov's early discussions of constraints on variation imposed by the 'sociolinguistic monitor,' we suggest that variation in individual speakers supports the notion that variables that are fundamentally grammatical are less likely to mark social factors than lexical variables are.

Abstract = {Objectives: This study examines the anatomical correlates of naming vs recognizing faces using a novel measure that utilizes culturally relevant and age-appropriate items, the Northwestern University Famous Faces (NUFFACE) Test, in primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a syndrome characterized by progressive language deficits and associatedwith cortical atrophy in areas important for word and object representations. Methods: NUFFACE Test performance of 27 controls (mean age 62.3 years) was compared with that of 30 patients with PPA (mean age 62 years). Associations between NUFFACE Test performance and cortical thickness measures were quantified within the PPA group. Results: Patients with PPA displayed significant impairment on the NUFFACE Test, demonstrating that it is a useful measure of famous-face identification for individuals with relatively young-onset dementias. Despite widespread distribution of atrophy in the PPA group, face naming impairments were correlated with atrophy of the left anterior temporal lobe while face recognition impairments were correlated with bitemporal atrophy. Conclusions: In addition to their clinical relevance for highlighting the distinction between face naming and recognition impairments in individuals with young-onset dementia, these findings add new insights into the dissociable clinico-anatomical substrates of lexical retrieval and object knowledge.

Abstract = {Repeating a word can have both facilitative and inhibitory effects on subsequent processing. The present study investigated these dynamics by examining the facilitative and inhibitory consequences of different kinds of item repetition in two individuals with aphasia and a group of neurologically intact control participants. The two individuals with aphasia were matched on overall aphasia severity, but had deficits at different levels of processing: one with a phonological deficit and spared semantic processing, the other with a semantic deficit and spared phonological processing. Participants completed a spoken word-to-picture matching task in which they had to pick which of four object images matched the spoken word. The trials were grouped into pairs such that exactly two objects from the first trial in a pair were present on screen during the second trial in the pair. When the second trial's target was the same as the first trial's target, compared to control participants, both participants with aphasia exhibited equally larger repetition priming effects. When the second trial's target was one of the new items, the participant with a phonological deficit exhibited a significantly more negative effect (i.e., second trial response slower than first trial response) than the control participants and the participant with a semantic deficit. Simulations of a computational model confirmed that this pattern of results could arise from (1) normal residual activation being functionally more significant when overall lexical processing is slower and (2) residual phonological activation of the previous trial's target having a particularly strong inhibitory effect specifically when phonological processing is impaired because the task was phonologically-driven (the spoken input specified the target). These results provide new insights into perseveration errors and lexical access deficits in aphasia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Three sentence production experiments investigate the relationship between lexical and structural processing scope. Speakers generated sentences with varying phrase structures in response to visual displays (e.g., The dog and the hat move above the fork and the tree/The dog moves above the hat and the fork and the tree). On half of the trials, one of the pictures in the arrays was previewed. Filler sentences varied preview position and sentence structure from trial to trial. When speakers could not anticipate the position of the previewed picture in the upcoming sentence (Experiment 1), preview benefit for pictures corresponding to the second noun to be produced was limited to pictures that fell within the sentence- initial phrase. When the linear position of the previewed picture was predictable, preview benefits were observed for the second noun to be produced, irrespective of phrase position (Experiment 2). However, no preview benefits were observed for the third noun to be produced (Experiment 3). In contrast, significant effects of initial phrase structure were observed in all experiments, with latencies increasing with initial phrase length. The results are consistent with speakers operating a phrasal scope for structural planning within which the scope of lexical access can vary.

Abstract = {The ability to understand the similarity between two phenomena is fundamental for humans. Designated by the term analogy in psychology, this ability plays a role in the categorization of phenomena in the world and in the organisation of the linguistic system. The use of analogy in language often results in non-standard utterances, particularly in speakers with aphasia. These non-standard utterances are almost always studied in a nominal context and considered as errors. We propose a study of the verbal lexicon and present findings that measure, by an action-video naming task, the importance of verb-based non-standard utterances made by 17 speakers with aphasia ('la dame déshabille l’orange'/the lady undresses the orange, 'elle casse la tomate'/she breaks the tomato). The first results we have obtained allow us to consider these type of utterances from a new perspective: we propose to eliminate the label of 'error', suggesting that they may be viewed as semantic approximations based upon a relationship of inter-domain synonymy and are ingrained in the heart of the lexical system.

Abstract = {Infants develop a lexical-semantic system of associatively and semantically related words by the end of the second year of life. However, the precise nature of the lexical relationships that underpin the structure-building process remains under-determined. We compare two types of lexical-semantic relationship, associative and taxonomic, using a lexical-priming adaption of the intermodal preferential looking task with 21- and 24- month-olds. Prime-target word pairs were either associatively or taxonomically related or unrelated. A further control condition evaluated the facility of a prime word, in the absence of a target word, to promote target preferences. Twenty-four-month-olds, but not 21-month-old infants, exhibited a priming effect in both associative and taxonomic conditions, pointing to the formation of a lexical-semantic network driven by both associative and taxonomic relatedness late in the second year. The pattern of priming in 24- month-olds indicates the operation of inhibitory processes: unrelated primes interfere with target recognition whereas related primes do not. We argue that taxonomic and associative relationships between words are integral to the emergence of a structured lexicon and discuss the importance of inhibitory mechanisms in shaping early lexical-semantic memory.

Abstract = {For nearly a century, linguists have suggested that diachronic merger is less likely between phonemes with a high functional load—that is, phonemes that distinguish many words in the language in question. However, limitations in data and computational power have made assessing this hypothesis difficult. Here we present the first larger-scale study of the functional load hypothesis, using data from sound changes in a diverse set of languages. Our results support the functional load hypothesis: phoneme pairs undergoing merger distinguish significantly fewer minimal pairs in the lexicon than unmerged phoneme pairs. Furthermore, we show that higher phoneme probability is positively correlated with merger, but that this effect is stronger for phonemes that distinguish no minimal pairs. Finally, within our dataset we find that minimal pair count and phoneme probability better predict merger than change in system entropy at the lexical or phoneme level.

Abstract = {Two eye movement experiments investigated intraword spacing (the space between letters within words) and interword spacing (the space between words) to explore the influence these variables have on eye movement control during reading. Both variables are important factors in determining the optimal use of space in a line of text, and fonts differ widely in how they employ these spaces. Prior research suggests that the proximity of flanking letters influences the identification of a central letter via lateral inhibition or crowding. If so, decrements in intraword spacing may produce inhibition in word processing. Still other research suggests that increases in intraword spacing can disrupt the integrity of word units. In English, interword spacing has a large influence on word segmentation and is important for saccade target selection. The results indicate an interplay between intra- and interword spacing that influences a font’s readability. Additionally, these studies highlight the importance of word segmentation processes and have implications for the nature of lexical processing (serial vs. parallel).

The graphs in Figures 1 and 2 are reversed. The online versions of this article have been corrected.]  The coordination of word-recognition and oculomotor processes during reading was evaluated in eye-tracking experiments that examined how word skipping, where a word is not fixated during first-pass reading, is affected by the lexical status of a letter string in the parafovea and ease of recognizing that string. Ease of lexical recognition was manipulated through target-word frequency (Experiment 1) and through repetition priming between prime-target pairs embedded in a sentence (Experiment 2). Using the gaze-contingent boundary technique the target word appeared in the parafovea either with full preview or with transposed-letter (TL) preview. The TL preview strings were nonwords in Experiment 1 (e.g., bilnk created from the target blink), but were words in Experiment 2 (e.g., sacred created from the target scared). Experiment 1 showed greater skipping for high-frequency than low-frequency target words in the full preview condition, but not in the TL preview (nonword) condition. Experiment 2 showed greater skipping for target words that repeated an earlier prime word than for those that did not, with this repetition priming occurring both with preview of the full target and with preview of the target’s TL neighbor word. However, time to progress from the word after the target was greater following skips of the TL preview word, whose meaning was anomalous in the sentence context, than following skips of the full preview word whose meaning fit sensibly into the sentence context. Together, the results support the idea that coordination between word-recognition and oculomotor processes occurs at the level of implicit lexical decisions.

Abstract = {Dyslexia is commonly attributed to a phonological deficit, but whether it effectively compromises the phonological grammar or lower level systems is rarely explored. To address this question, we gauge the sensitivity of dyslexics to grammatical phonological restrictions on spoken onset clusters (e.g., bl in block). Across languages, certain onsets are preferred to others (e.g., blif ≻ bnif≻ bdif, where≻ indicates a preference). Here, we show that dyslexic participants (adult native speakers of Hebrew) are fully sensitive to these phonological restrictions, and they extend them irrespective of whether the onsets are attested in their language (e.g., bnif vs. bdif) or unattested (e.g., mlif vs. mdif). Dyslexics, however, showed reduced sensitivity to phonetic contrasts (e.g., blif vs. belif; ba vs. pa). Together, these results suggest that the known difficulties of dyslexics in speech processing could emanate not from the phonological grammar, but rather from lower level impairments to acoustic/phonetic encoding, lexical storage, and retrieval.

The syntactical skills of the French-speaking children who stutter are better than their lexical skills. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two experiments were carried out to investigate the orthographic neighborhood density (N) and neighborhood frequency effects (NF) in reading aloud tasks. The experimental stimuli consisted of 64 words corresponding to a 2 × 2 factorial manipulation of N and NF. In the first experiment, during a Go/NoGo reading aloud task, an inhibitory NF effect was observed when the words had a high number of neighbors. In the second experiment, a reading aloud task in which the subjects had to pronounce words and pseudowords mixed in the same session, a facilitative N effect was observed. N and NF effects were attributed to different task demands on the process of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background/Study Context: This study examined the role of increased adult age in the processing of lexical information presented in foveal and parafoveal areas of the retina (right and left visual fields). Previous research has shown that older adults are able to compensate for age-related changes though a highly practiced skill (Salthouse, 1984, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 113, 345–371). The authors examined if older adults would show a lexical-only parafoveal benefit. Methods: Two experiments were conducted on both younger and older adults. In Experiment 1, participants completed a lexical decision task that presented words in the fovea and parafovea in both visual fields. In Experiment 2, the task was a font discrimination task (nonlexical) with foveal and parafoveal presentation in both visual fields. Results: In Experiment 1, the authors observed word frequency effects for both foveal and right parafoveal presentation locations. This effect was present for both older and younger adults. Experiment 2 was a font discrimination task and there was no right parafoveal advantage for older adults on this task, suggesting that this effect observed in Experiment 1 was lexical in nature due to the highly overlearned nature of word recognition. Conclusion: These results suggest that older adults may compensate for slower encoding time in reading by encoding text to the right of fixation more efficiently than younger adults. This suggests an asymmetrical change in the useful field of view that is lexical in nature. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study explores the morphosyntactic processing deficit in developmental dyslexia, addressing the on-going debate on the linguistic nature of the disorder, and directly testing the hypothesis that the deficit is based on underlying processing difficulties, such as acoustic and/or phonological impairments. Short German sentences consisting of a pronoun and a verb, either correct or containing a morphosyntactic violation, were auditorily presented to 17 German-speaking adults with dyslexia, and 17 matched control participants, while an EEG was recorded. In order to investigate the interaction between low-level phonological processing and morphosyntactic processing, the verbal inflections were manipulated to consist of different levels of acoustic salience. The event-related potential (ERP) results confirm altered morphosyntactic processing in participants with dyslexia, especially when morphosyntactic violations are expressed by both lexical and inflectional changes. Moreover, ERP data on phoneme discrimination and behavioural data on phonemic awareness and verbal short-term memory reveal phonological deficits in dyslexic participants. However, a causal relationship between phonological and morphosyntactic processing was not conclusive, because anomalous morphosyntactic processing in dyslexia is not directly mediated by acoustic salience, rather it correlates with high-level phonological skills and is mediated by lexical cues.

The unavailability of normative data and standardized assessments for young Maltese children hinders the identification of early language delays. This study aimed to document Maltese children’s expressive vocabulary growth and accompanying range of variation, to assist identification of children at risk for language impairment. The expressive vocabularies of 44 typically developing children aged 12–30 months were measured through caregiver report. Mean scores at each age point were characterized by substantial individual variation. Gender was not related to mean growth in vocabulary production. Minimum scores were compared to clinical thresholds for English-speaking children. Results emphasized the assessment- and language-specific nature of identification criteria. Nevertheless, established thresholds may be referred to when normative data for particular languages/language pairs are limited. In such contexts, the consideration of other risk markers gains importance in supplementing findings on lexical expression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Memory studies utilizing long-term repetition priming have generally demonstrated that priming is greater for low-frequency than for high-frequency words and that this effect persists if words intervene between the prime and the target. In contrast, word-recognition studies utilizing masked short-term repetition priming have typically shown that the magnitude of repetition priming does not differ as a function of word frequency and does not persist across intervening words. We conducted an eyetracking-while-reading experiment to determine which of these patterns more closely resembles the relationship between frequency and repetition during the natural reading of a text. Frequency was manipulated using proper names that were either high-frequency (e.g., Stephen) or low-frequency (e.g., Dominic). The critical name was later repeated in the sentence, or a new name was introduced. First-pass reading times and skipping rates on the critical name revealed robust repetition-by-frequency interactions, such that the magnitude of the repetition-priming effect was greater for low-frequency than for high-frequency names. In contrast, measures of later processing showed effects of repetition that did not depend on lexical frequency. These results are interpreted within a framework that conceptualizes eye-movement control as being influenced in different ways by lexical- and discourse-level factors.

Abstract = {Prosodic patterning is a key structural element of spoken language. However, the potential role of prosodic awareness in the phonological difficulties that characterise children with developmental dyslexia has been little studied. Here we report the first longitudinal study of sensitivity to syllable stress in children with dyslexia, enabling the exploration of predictive factors. An initial cohort of 104 children was recruited. In Experiment 1 (mean age 9 years), participants received a reiterative speech task (DeeDee task) and in Experiment 2 (4 years later, mean age 13 years), they received a direct stress perception task. The children with dyslexia were compared to both younger reading-level matched controls (aged 7 years initially) and to age-matched controls. Children with dyslexia showed impaired sensitivity to syllable stress compared to both reading-level and age-matched controls when aged 9 years, and to age-matched controls only when aged 13 years. The longitudinal predictors of sensitivity to syllable stress were investigated, controlling for prosodic sensitivity at Time 1 as the autoregressor. Measures of auditory sensory processing and sub-lexical phonological awareness were unique longitudinal predictors. Prosodic sensitivity in children was also a significant longitudinal predictor of reading development, accounting for independent variance from sub-lexical phonological sensitivity (rhyme awareness).

Abstract = {Purpose: Previous research has demonstrated that native English speakers can learn lexical tones in word context (pitch-to-word learning), to an extent. However, learning success depends on learners' pre-training sensitivity to pitch patterns. The aim of this study was to determine whether lexical pitch-pattern training given before lexical training could improve learning and whether or not the extent of improvement depends on pre-training pitch-pattern sensitivity. Method: Learners with high and low pitch-pattern sensitivity were given training on lexical pitch patterns before lexical training. Results: It was found that such training resulted in better learning than lexical training alone, primarily in learners with low pre-training pitch-pattern sensitivity. Conclusion: These data support the importance of considering individual aptitudes when developing training and also the notion of phonetic–phonological–lexical continuity in word learning.

The aim of the present study was to extend the previous findings on noun processing to verb processing. In the first experiment, Dutch-English bilinguals performed a lexical decision task in their second language and were faster to recognize cognate verbs (e.g., Dutch-English geven-give ) presented out of context than control words. This verb cognate facilitation effect was not modulated by verb tense. In a second experiment, cognates and controls were presented in sentence contexts while eye movements were recorded. In contrast to the strong cognate facilitation effects on early and later reading time measures for nouns found in earlier studies, cognate facilitation was only observed on a later reading time measure (i.e., go-past time).

The commentator would suggest that, while Bleger was offering a much needed corrective to the overly positivistic and one-person psychology of that period, a psychology driven towards 'de-totalization' and a closed system by assumptions about psychic determinism, it would be a mistake, clinically, to completely do away with the implications of those assumptions for analytic listening and technique. The commentator questions the conclusion drawn by Greenberg from Bleger's argument in favor of the dramatic point of view and perhaps Bleger as well, if he were to agree with Greenberg because Greenberg seems to disqualify the merit and efficacy of the lexical value of verbal exchange.

Abstract = {The response exclusion account (REA), advanced by Mahon and colleagues, localises the distractor frequency effect and the semantic interference effect in picture naming at the level of the response output buffer. We derive four predictions from the REA: (1) the size of the distractor frequency effect should be identical to the frequency effect obtained when distractor words are read aloud, (2) the distractor frequency effect should not change in size when stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) is manipulated, (3) the interference effect induced by a distractor word (as measured from a nonword control distractor) should increase in size with increasing SOA, and (4) the word frequency effect and the semantic interference effect should be additive. The results of the picture-naming task in Experiment 1 and the word-reading task in Experiment 2 refute all four predictions. We discuss a tentative account of the findings obtained within a traditional selection-by-competition model in which both context effects are localised at the level of lexical selection.

Abstract = {In this article, we describe the most extensive set of word associations collected to date. The database contains over 12,000 cue words for which more than 70,000 participants generated three responses in a multiple-response free association task. The goal of this study was (1) to create a semantic network that covers a large part of the human lexicon, (2) to investigate the implications of a multiple-response procedure by deriving a weighted directed network, and (3) to show how measures of centrality and relatedness derived from this network predict both lexical access in a lexical decision task and semantic relatedness in similarity judgment tasks. First, our results show that the multiple-response procedure results in a more heterogeneous set of responses, which lead to better predictions of lexical access and semantic relatedness than do single-response procedures. Second, the directed nature of the network leads to a decomposition of centrality that primarily depends on the number of incoming links or in-degree of each node, rather than its set size or number of outgoing links. Both studies indicate that adequate representation formats and sufficiently rich data derived from word associations represent a valuable type of information in both lexical and semantic processing.

Abstract = {Recently, Meyer, Belke, Telling and Humphreys (2007) reported that competitor objects with homophonous names (e.g., boy) interfere with identifying a target object (e.g., buoy) in a visual search task, suggesting that an object name's phonology becomes automatically activated even in situations in which participants do not have the intention to speak. The present study explored the generality of this finding by testing a different phonological relation (rhyming object names, e.g., cat–hat) and by varying details of the experimental procedure. Experiment 1 followed the procedure by Meyer et al. Participants were familiarized with target and competitor objects and their names at the beginning of the experiment and the picture of the target object was presented prior to the search display on each trial. In Experiment 2, the picture of the target object presented prior to the search display was replaced by its name. In Experiment 3, participants were not familiarized with target and competitor objects and their names at the beginning of the experiment. A small interference effect from phonologically related competitors was obtained in Experiments 1 and 2 but not in Experiment 3, suggesting that the way the relevant objects are introduced to participants affects the chances of observing an effect from phonologically related competitors.

Abstract = {The importance of vocabulary in reading comprehension emphasizes the need to accurately assess an individual’s familiarity with words. The present article highlights problems with using occurrence counts in corpora as an index of word familiarity, especially when studying individuals varying in reading experience. We demonstrate via computational simulations and norming studies that corpus-based word frequencies systematically overestimate strengths of word representations, especially in the low-frequency range and in smaller-size vocabularies. Experience-driven differences in word familiarity prove to be faithfully captured by the subjective frequency ratings collected from responders at different experience levels. When matched on those levels, this lexical measure explains more variance than corpus-based frequencies in eye-movement and lexical decision latencies to English words, attested in populations with varied reading experience and skill. Furthermore, the use of subjective frequencies removes the widely reported (corpus) Frequency × Skill interaction, showing that more skilled readers are equally faster in processing any word than the less skilled readers, not disproportionally faster in processing lower frequency words. This finding challenges the view that the more skilled an individual is in generic mechanisms of word processing, the less reliant he or she will be on the actual lexical characteristics of that word.

Abstract = {We report two experiments that investigate the effects of sentence context on bilingual lexical access in Spanish and English. Highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals read sentences in Spanish and English that included a marked word to be named. The word was either a cognate with similar orthography and/or phonology in the two languages, or a matched non-cognate control. Sentences appeared in one language alone (i.e., Spanish or English) and target words were not predictable on the basis of the preceding semantic context. In Experiment 1, we mixed the language of the sentence within a block such that sentences appeared in an alternating run in Spanish or in English. These conditions partly resemble normally occurring inter-sentential code-switching. In these mixed-language sequences, cognates were named faster than non-cognates in both languages. There were no effects of switching the language of the sentence. In Experiment 2, with Spanish-English bilinguals matched closely to those who participated in the first experiment, we blocked the language of the sentences to encourage language-specific processes. The results were virtually identical to those of the mixed-language experiment. In both cases, target cognates were named faster than non-cognates, and the magnitude of the effect did not change according to the broader context. Taken together, the results support the predictions of the Bilingual Interactive Activation + Model (Dijkstra and van Heuven, 2002) in demonstrating that bilingual lexical access is language non-selective even under conditions in which language-specific cues should enable selective processing. They also demonstrate that, in contrast to lexical switching from one language to the other, inter-sentential code-switching of the sort in which bilinguals frequently engage, imposes no significant costs to lexical processing.

Abstract = {Visual imagery during sleep has long been a topic of persistent speculation, but its private nature has hampered objective analysis. Here we present a neural decoding approach in which machine-learning models predict the contents of visual imagery during the sleep-onset period, given measured brain activity, by discovering links between human functional magnetic resonance imaging patterns and verbal reports with the assistance of lexical and image databases. Decoding models trained on stimulus-induced brain activity in visual cortical areas showed accurate classification, detection, and identification of contents. Our findings demonstrate that specific visual experience during sleep is represented by brain activity patterns shared by stimulus perception, providing a means to uncover subjective contents of dreaming using objective neural measurement.

Abstract = {Most studies of phonological development have explored the acquisition of segments, syllables and words using perceptual/transcription methods. Less is known about the articulatory aspects of early speech, or the development of articulatory-acoustic mapping. Recent research on adult speech finds that coarticulation effects are evidenced in both the acoustics and the articulatory gestures, and suggests tighter coarticulation and less variability for monomorphemic compared to polymorphemic segment sequences. The present study explored phonological context and morphological effects in the speech of five adults and five 2-year-olds, combining acoustic and articulatory analysis from ultrasound recordings. The results show that coarticulation effects are found in the word-final consonant cluster (box) for both adults and children. For children, these were evidenced only in the articulatory data. In addition, both age groups showed differences in tongue height between the monomorphemic (box) and bimorphemic (rocks) clusters, suggesting a possible morphological effect. These findings confirm that ultrasound methods can be successfully employed to explore aspects of early gestural development in children as young as 2, and raise many questions regarding the nature of speech planning processes as a function of lexical versus morphological form.

Abstract = {By 27 months of age, toddlers hearing a novel verb in transitive syntax are able to (1) establish an initial representation for the verb based on its syntactic properties alone, even in the absence of a relevant visual scene, and (2) retrieve this representation later when a candidate causative referent comes into view. This ability is important considering that over 60% of the verbs that mothers produce in conversations with their children refer to events that are not currently observable. Here, we advance this finding in two ways. First, we demonstrate the same ability in 21-month-olds, who do not yet show mastery of transitive structures in their own productions. Second, we use analyses of toddlers’ eye gaze to explore the time-course with which they process the novel verb and assign its referent when candidate scenes become available. These results (1) provide the first evidence that 21-month-olds establish a representation of a novel verb’s meaning from syntax alone, and (2) establish that they process and assign meaning to novel verbs with a similar time-course to that for novel nouns. The findings are thus relevant to our understanding of both word learning and lexical processing of novel words. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Method: Data for 2,191 Korean children (211 children recruited 'offline' through preschools, and 1,980 recruited 'online' via the Internet) and 274 U.S. children were obtained using the Language Development Survey (LDS). Results: Mean vocabulary size was slightly larger in the offline than the online group, but the groups were acquiring almost identical words. Mean vocabulary size did not differ by country; girls and older children had larger vocabularies in both countries. The Korean–U.S. Q correlations for percentage use of LDS words (.53 and .56) indicated considerable concordance across countries in lexical composition. Noun dominance was as large in Korean lexicons as in U.S. lexicons. About half of the most commonly reported words for the Korean and U.S. children were identical. Lexicons of late talkers resembled those of typically developing younger children in the same sample. Conclusions: Despite linguistic and discourse differences between Korean and English, LDS findings indicated considerable cross-linguistic similarity with respect to vocabulary size, lexical composition, and late talking.

Abstract = {This experiment used the masked priming lexical decision task to address previous contradictory evidence about the relative strength of priming for (i) transparent pairs (e.g., worker WORK) which are morphologically and semantically related; (ii) opaque pairs (e.g., corner CORN) which appear to be morphological relatives but are not semantically related; and (iii) form pairs (e.g., turnip TURN) that are only orthographically related. The average data for 92 university students showed stronger priming effects for transparent than opaque or form pairs, due to a constant 'headstart' for related relative to unrelated pairs across the RT distribution. However, these average effects were significantly modulated by individual differences in independent measures of spelling and vocabulary. A 'semantic profile', defined by relatively higher vocabulary than spelling, was associated with robust priming for transparent pairs, particularly for slower responses, but little priming for opaque or form pairs. In contrast, individuals with an 'orthographic profile' of relatively higher spelling than vocabulary showed sustained priming for opaque pairs that was at least as strong as for transparently related pairs. This evidence of systematic individual differences amongst skilled readers has important implications for theories of lexical representation and processing.

Abstract = {We examined whether iconicity in American Sign Language (ASL) enhances translation performance for new learners and proficient signers. Fifteen hearing nonsigners and 15 proficient ASL–English bilinguals performed a translation recognition task and a production translation task. Nonsigners were taught 28 ASL verbs (14 iconic; 14 noniconic) prior to performing these tasks. Only new learners benefited from sign iconicity, recognising iconic translations faster and more accurately and exhibiting faster forward (English–ASL) and backward (ASL–English) translation times for iconic signs. In contrast, proficient ASL–English bilinguals exhibited slower recognition and translation times for iconic signs. We suggest iconicity aids memorisation in the early stages of adult sign language learning, but for fluent L2 signers, iconicity interacts with other variables that slow translation (specifically, the iconic signs had more translation equivalents than the noniconic signs). Iconicity may also have slowed translation performance by forcing conceptual mediation for iconic signs, which is slower than translating via direct lexical links.

Abstract = {We investigated the influence of word class and translation ambiguity on cross-linguistic representation and processing. Bilingual speakers of English and Spanish performed translation production and translation recognition tasks on nouns and verbs in both languages. Words either had a single translation or more than one translation. Translation probability, as determined by normative data, was the strongest predictor of translation production and translation recognition, after controlling for psycholinguistic variables. Word class did not explain additional variability in translation performance, raising the possibility that previous findings of differences between nouns and verbs might be attributed to the greater translation ambiguity of verbs relative to nouns. Proficiency in the second language was associated with quicker and more successful production of translations for ambiguous words, and with more accurate recognition of translations for ambiguous words. Working memory capacity was related to the speed of recognizing low probability translations for ambiguous words. These results underscore the importance of considering translation ambiguity in research on bilingual lexical and conceptual knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Executive control abilities and lexical access speed in Stroop performance were investigated in English monolinguals and two groups of bilinguals (English–Chinese and Chinese–English) in their first (L1) and second (L2) languages. Predictions were based on a bilingual cognitive advantage hypothesis, implicating cognitive control ability as the critical factor determining Stroop interference; and two bilingual lexical disadvantage hypotheses, focusing on lexical access speed. Importantly, each hypothesis predicts different response patterns in a Stroop task manipulating stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). There was evidence for a bilingual cognitive advantage, although this effect was sensitive to a number of variables including proficiency, language immersion, and script. In lexical access speed, no differences occurred between monolinguals and bilinguals in their native languages, but there was evidence for a delay in L2 processing speed relative to the L1. Overall, the data highlight the multitude of factors affecting executive control and lexical access speed in bilinguals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Cross-language priming is a widely used experimental paradigm in psycholinguistics to study how bilinguals’ two languages are represented and organized. Researchers have observed a number of interesting patterns from the priming effects of both translation equivalents and semantically related word pairs across languages. In this study, we implement a self-organizing neural network model, DevLex–II, to simulate these two types of priming effects across Chinese and English. Specifically, our model incorporates a computational mechanism for simulating spreading activation based on the distance between bilingual words in the semantic space. The model also considers additional factors that modulate priming effects, such as the initial activation level of the prime words and the degree to which the target word can be recognized. Our model reveals differences with respect to the priming effects as a function of bilingual type (early versus late L2 learners), directions of priming (L1 to L2 versus L2 to L1), and types of priming (translation versus semantic priming). These simulated differences are compared with empirical findings from previous studies and discussed in the light of interactive and developmental theories of bilingual lexical representation.

Abstract = {Neighbourhood Density (ND) and Phonotactic Probability (PP) influence word learning in children. This influence appears to change over development but the separate developmental trajectories of influence of PP and ND on word learning have not previously been mapped. This study examined the cross-sectional developmental trajectories of influence of PP and ND on fast-mapping in thirty-eight English-speaking children aged 3;01–5;02, in a task varying PP and ND orthogonally. PP and ND exerted separable influences on fast-mapping. Overall, low ND supported better fast-mapping. The influence of PP changed across the developmental trajectory, ‘switching’ from a high to a low PP advantage. A potential explanation for this ‘switch’ is advanced, suggesting that it represents functional reorganization in the developing lexicon, which emerges from changes in the developing lexicon, as phonological knowledge is abstracted from lexical knowledge, over development.

Abstract = {The present study explores phonetic processing in deaf children with cochlear implants (CIs) when they have to learn phonetically similar words. Forty-six 34-to-78-month-old French-speaking deaf children with CIs were tested on 16 different trials. In each trial, they were first trained with two word–object pairings, and then a third object was presented and labeled with one of the familiar words. Children were asked to match one of the previously labeled objects with the third (same-labeled) object. Each pair of words contrasted on either the initial consonant or the first vowel by one or several phonetic features. The results show that deaf children with CIs are able to establish a new referential link between a word and an object. However, their performance is lower than that previously observed in normal-hearing children (NH). In such a situation, they process contrasts involving several phonetic features correctly, but show difficulties with minimal contrasts. The ability to recruit fine phonetic sensitivity during word learning appears to be influenced mainly by duration of implant use, with an overall increase of performance during the 3 years after implantation. There was no chronological age effect, nor age at implantation effect on the quality of processing. Difficulty with minimal contrasts and the absence of any age at implantation effects in this age range are discussed in light of recent studies on lexical development.

Abstract = {Eye-movement control during reading depends on foveal and parafoveal information. If the parafoveal preview of the next word is suppressed, reading is less efficient. A linear mixed model (LMM) reanalysis of McDonald (2006) confirmed his observation that preview benefit may be limited to parafoveal words that have been selected as the saccade target. Going beyond the original analyses, in the same LMM, we examined how the preview effect (i.e., the difference in single-fixation duration, SFD, between random-letter and identical preview) depends on the gaze duration on the pretarget word and on the amplitude of the saccade moving the eye onto the target word. There were two key results: (a) The shorter the saccade amplitude (i.e., the larger preview space), the shorter a subsequent SFD with an identical preview; this association was not observed with a random-letter preview. (b) However, the longer the gaze duration on the pretarget word, the longer the subsequent SFD on the target, with the difference between random-letter string and identical previews increasing with preview time. A third pattern—increasing cost of a random-letter string in the parafovea associated with shorter saccade amplitudes—was observed for target gaze durations. Thus, LMMs revealed that preview effects, which are typically summarized under 'preview benefit', are a complex mixture of preview cost and preview benefit and vary with preview space and preview time. The consequence for reading is that parafoveal preview may not only facilitate, but also interfere with lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Toddlers who are late talkers demonstrate delays in phonological and lexical skills. However, the influence of phonological factors on lexical acquisition in toddlers who are late talkers has not been examined directly. Aims: To examine the influence of phonotactic probability/neighbourhood density on word learning in toddlers who were late talkers using comprehension, production and word recognition tasks. Methods&Procedures: Two-year-olds who were late talkers (n = 12) and typically developing toddlers (n = 12) were exposed to 12 novel pseudo-words for unfamiliar objects in ten training sessions. Pseudo-words contained high or low phonotactic probability English sound sequences. The toddlers’ comprehension, speech production and detection of mispronunciation of the newly learned words were examined using a preferential looking paradigm. Outcomes & Results: Late talkers showed poorer performance than toddlers with typical language development in all three tasks: comprehension, production and detection of mispronunciations. The toddlers with typical language development showed better speech production and more sensitivity to mispronunciations for high than low phonotactic probability/neighbourhood density sequences. Phonotactic probability/neighbourhood density did not influence the late talkers’ speech production or sensitivity to mispronunciations; they performed similarly for pseudo-words with high and low phonotactic probability/neighbourhood density sound sequences. Conclusions & Implications: The results indicate that some late talkers do not recognize statistical properties of their language, which may contribute to their slower lexical learning.

Abstract = {University students made spelling accuracy judgments about correctly and incorrectly spelled words that had been seen incorrectly spelled (Experiments 1 and 2). In contrast to results for spelling production, studying a misspelling produced a small benefit in classification of the correct word at test. When the studied misspelling was re-presented at test, there was a substantial cost in accuracy. Testing spelling recognition in an old context had a biassing effect, but there was little evidence of context re-instatement effects for studied words. In Experiment 3 students decided whether a correctly spelled word was spelled the same way at study and test. Participants' poor performance with words studied misspelled supports a priming explanation of the benefit for correct words. The differential effects for correct and incorrect test words cannot be explained in terms of updating abstract lexical representations, and the limitations on participants' item and context memory challenge episodic accounts of lexical representations.

Abstract = {Studies and models have suggested that color perception first involves access to semantic representations of color. This result leads to two questions: (1) is knowledge able to influence the perception of color when associated with a color? and (2) can the perception of color really involve only semantic representations? We developed an experiment where participants have to discriminate the color of a patch (yellow vs. green). The target patch is preceded either by a black-and-white line drawing or by a word representing a natural object associated with the same or a different color (banana vs. frog). We expected a priming effect for pictures because, with a 350-ms SOA, they only involve access to semantic representations of color, whereas words seem only elicit an access to lexical representations. As expected, we found a priming effect for pictures, but also for words. Moreover, we found a general slowdown of response times in the word-prime-condition suggesting the need of an additional processing step to produce priming. In a second experiment, we manipulated the SOA in order to preclude a semantic access in the word-prime-condition that could explain the additional step of processing. We also found a priming effect, suggesting that interaction with perception occurs at a lexical level and the additional step occurs at a color perception level. In the discussion, we develop a new model of color perception assuming that color perception involves access to semantic representations and then access to lexical representations.

Abstract = {Sensory experience ratings (SERs) reflect the extent to which a word evokes a sensory and/or perceptual experience in the mind of the reader. Juhasz, Yap, Dicke, Taylor, and Gullick (Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 64:1683–1691, 2011) demonstrated that SERs predict a significant amount of variance in lexical-decision response times in two megastudies of lexical processing when a large number of established psycholinguistic variables are controlled for. Here we provide the SERs for the 2,857 monosyllabic words used in the Juhasz et al. study, as well as newly collected ratings on 3,000 disyllabic words. New analyses with the combined set of words confirmed that SERs predict a reliable amount of variance in the lexical-decision response times and naming times from the English Lexicon Project (Balota, Yap, Cortese, Hutchison, Kessler, Loftus, & Treiman, Behavior Research Methods 39:445–459, 2007) when a large number of surface, lexical, and semantic variables are statistically controlled for. The results suggest that the relative availability of sensory/perceptual information associated with a word contributes to lexical–semantic processing.

Abstract = {Several neuropsychological studies have reported that patients with memory deficits exhibit a dissociation of effects attributed to semantic and lexical-phonological information in verbal working memory (e.g., Reilly, Martin, & Grossman, 2005; Romani & Martin, 1999). The present study reports on 3 experiments conducted with individuals without memory problems to examine the dissociation between the word imageability effect (WIE) and the word frequency effect (WFE). Experiment 1 used a modified semantic recognition task, in which participants were presented with 10-item lists and selected synonyms of list words from among 5 words. This task led to a significant WIE but no WFE. On the other hand, Experiment 2 used a modified recognition task in which targets were homophones, to promote the usage of phonological information while minimizing the potential impact of semantic information. There was no WIE but a significant WFE in Experiment 2. Experiment 3 replicated the results of Experiment 1 using 5-item lists and a 2-alternative forced choice procedure. Taken together, these results systematically replicate the double dissociation observed in neuropsychological studies. These findings suggest that semantic information can contribute to successful retrieval from verbal working memory without mediation from lexical-phonological information.

Abstract = {In this study, we present 3 picture–word interference (PWI) experiments designed to investigate whether lexical selection processes are competitive. We focus on semantic associative relations, which should interfere according to competitive models but not according to certain noncompetitive models. In a modified version of the PWI paradigm, distractor word pairs were simultaneously presented with the target picture. The distractor words were orthographically related directly to the target picture name (distractors: camera bagel; target: camel), indirectly related to the name of a semantic associate of the target (distractors: camera bagel; target: pyramid, an associate of camel), or unrelated. In a first experiment, which included only indirect relations, we failed to find interference from indirectly activated associates. However, in 2 subsequent experiments that included the associates as naming trials within the experiment, we demonstrated that indirect, orthographically mediated activation of associates produces reliable interference effects. The results indicate that semantic interference is not restricted to members of the same category and are problematic for models of lexical selection that do not include lexical competition.

Abstract = {The present study investigated the event-related brain potential (ERP) correlates of word stress processing. Previous results showed that the violation of a legal stress pattern elicited two consecutive Mismatch Negativity (MMN) components synchronized to the changes on the first and second syllable. The aim of the present study was to test whether ERPs reflect only the detection of salient features present on the syllables, or they reflect the activation of long-term stress related representations. We examined ERPs elicited by pseudowords with no lexical representation in two conditions: the standard having a legal stress patterns, and the deviant an illegal one, and the standard having an illegal stress pattern, and the deviant a legal one. We found that the deviant having an illegal stress pattern elicited two consecutive MMN components, whereas the deviant having a legal stress pattern did not elicit MMN. Moreover, pseudowords with a legal stress pattern elicited the same ERP responses irrespective of their role in the odd-ball sequence, i.e., if they were standards or deviants. The results suggest that stress pattern changes are processed relying on long-term representation of word stress. To account for these results, we propose that the processing of stress cues is based on language-specific, pre-lexical stress templates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to examine predictions derived from the Lexical Quality Hypothesis regarding relations among word decoding, working-memory capacity, and the ability to integrate new concepts into a developing discourse representation. Hierarchical Linear Modeling was used to quantify the effects of three text properties (length, frequency, and number of new concepts) on reading times of focal and spillover sentences, with variance in those effects estimated as a function of individual difference factors (decoding, vocabulary, print exposure, and working-memory capacity). The analysis revealed complex, cross-level interactions that complement the Lexical Quality Hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A fundamental component of language acquisition involves organizing words into grammatical categories. Previous literature has suggested a number of ways in which this categorization task might be accomplished. Here we ask whether the patterning of the words in a corpus of linguistic input (distributional information) is sufficient, along with a small set of learning biases, to extract these underlying structural categories. In a series of experiments, we show that learners can acquire linguistic form-classes, generalizing from instances of the distributional contexts of individual words in the exposure set to the full range of contexts for all the words in the set. Crucially, we explore how several specific distributional variables enable learners to form a category of lexical items and generalize to novel words, yet also allow for exceptions that maintain lexical specificity. We suggest that learners are sensitive to the contexts of individual words, the overlaps among contexts across words, the non-overlap of contexts (or systematic gaps in information), and the size of the exposure set. We also ask how learners determine the category membership of a new word for which there is very sparse contextual information. We find that, when there are strong category cues and robust category learning of other words, adults readily generalize the distributional properties of the learned category to a new word that shares just one context with the other category members. However, as the distributional cues regarding the category become sparser and contain more consistent gaps, learners show more conservatism in generalizing distributional properties to the novel word. Taken together, these results show that learners are highly systematic in their use of the distributional properties of the input corpus, using them in a principled way to determine when to generalize and when to preserve lexical specificity.

Abstract = {Abstract: I present a new interpretation of reaction time (RT) data from behavioural experiments. From a physical perspective, the entropy of the RT distribution–the temporal entropy–provides a model-free estimate of the amount of processing performed by the cognitive system. This new measure shifts the focus from the conventional interpretation of RTs being either long or short, into their distribution being more or less complex in terms of entropy. I introduce the formulation of the theory, followed by an empirical test using a large database of human RTs in lexical processing tasks. Using the measure, I obtain estimates of the processing loads to individual stimuli (i.e., words), as well as estimates for the overall rate at which the system processes information in these tasks. The relation between the temporal entropy and the RTs can be captured by a simple linear equation. I argue that this equation constitutes the equivalent of a ‘phase diagram’ of a task, providing indications )},

Abstract = {This study investigated second language (L2) lexical development in the spontaneous speech of six adult, L2 English learners in a 1-year longitudinal study. One important aspect of lexical development is lexical organization and depth of knowledge. Hypernymic relations, the hierarchical relationships among related words that vary in relation to their semantic specificity (e.g., Golden Retriever vs. dog vs. animal), are an important indicator of both lexical organization and depth of knowledge. Thus, this study used hypernymy values from the WordNet database and a lexical diversity measure to analyze lexical development. Statistical analyses in this study indicated that both hypernymic relations and lexical diversity in L2 learners increase over time. Additionally, lexical diversity and hypernymic values correlated significantly, suggesting that as learners' lexicons grow, learners have access to a wider range of hypernymy levels. These findings are discussed in relation to developing abstractness in language, extending hypernymic knowledge, and the growth of lexical networks.},

Abstract = {Abstract: Sentence and short-text semantic similarity measures are becoming an important part of many natural language processing tasks, such as text summarization and conversational agents. This paper presents SyMSS, a new method for computing short-text and sentence semantic similarity. The method is based on the notion that the meaning of a sentence is made up of not only the meanings of its individual words, but also the structural way the words are combined. Thus, SyMSS captures and combines syntactic and semantic information to compute the semantic similarity of two sentences. Semantic information is obtained from a lexical database. Syntactic information is obtained through a deep parsing process that finds the phrases in each sentence. With this information, the proposed method measures the semantic similarity between concepts that play the same syntactic role. Psychological plausibility is added to the method by using previous findings about how humans weight different syntac)},

Abstract = {A lexical modeling methodology was employed to examine how the distribution of phonemic patterns in the lexicon constrains lexical equivalence under conditions of reduced phonetic distinctiveness experienced by speechreaders. The technique involved selection of a phonemically transcribed machine-readable lexical database; definition of transcription rules based on measures of phonetic similarity; application of the transcription rules to a lexical database and formation of lexical equivalence classes; and computation of 3 metrics to examine the transcribed lexicon. The metric percent words unique demonstrated that distribution of words in the language preserves lexical uniqueness across a wide range in the number of potentially available phonemic distinctions. Expected class size demonstrated that if at least 12 phonemic equivalence classes were available, any given word would be highly similar to only a few other words. Percent information extracted provided evidence that high-frequency words tend not to reside in the same lexical equivalence classes as other high-frequency words. The steepness of the functions obtained for each metric shows that small increments in the number of visually perceptible phonemic distinctions can result in substantial changes in lexical uniqueness.

Abstract = {Multilingual lexicons are needed in various applications, such as cross-lingual information retrieval, machine translation, and some others. Often, these applications suffer from the ambiguity of dictionary items, especially when an intermediate natural language is involved in the process of the dictionary construction, since this language adds its ambiguity to the ambiguity of working languages. This paper aims to propose a new method for producing multilingual dictionaries without the risk of introducing additional ambiguity. As a disambiguated intermediate language we use the so-called Universal Words. A set of more than 200,000 unambiguous Universal Words have been constructed automatically on the basis of the well-known English lexical database WordNet. This approach is being used for the construction of a five language-dictionary in the field of cultural heritage within the framework of the PATRILEX project sponsored by the Spanish Research Council.},

Abstract = {In this study I introduce BioFrameNet, an extension of the Berkeley FrameNet lexical database to the domain of molecular biology. I examine the syntactic and semantic combinatorial possibilities exhibited in the lexical items used in this domain in order to get a better understanding of the grammatical properties of the language used in scientific writings on molecular biology.    The particular data considered is a collection of Gene References in Function (GRIF) texts that describe various types of intracellular protein transport events, a collection that had previously been annotated for an ontologically grounded knowledge base. GRIF texts use long, complex noun phrases, with the omission of many items, resulting in a dense, telegraphic style of writing. This introduces an additional level of complexity to language used in scientific writings of this domain.    In providing a frame semantic analysis and cataloging of the grammatical structures used in the scientific language of molecular biology, we see how well a FrameNet approach can handle language of this domain. Extending FrameNet to this domain serves as a testing ground for some of FrameNet's principles and claims, as it becomes evident how well a FrameNet approach handles language in a significantly different field than has been previously examined. I show how domain ontologies and knowledge bases, sources of definitions and classifications of biological phenomena based entirely on their biological properties, can be used in conjunction with lexical resources. At the same time, I also illustrate the overlap of grammatical properties across separate domain ontology classes, demonstrating that although the biology defined and classified in these classes is different, language used to describe and discuss them is not. Finally, I also explore the possibility that BioFrameNet can be used with tools that carry out Natural Language Processing tasks such as automatic semantic role labeling. Therefore, this work is at the intersection of theoretical frame semantics and practical applications and will potentially provide benefit to linguists, BioNLP engineers, and biologists.

Abstract = {Automatic syllabification of words is challenging, not least because the syllable is not easy to define precisely. Consequently, no accepted standard algorithm for automatic syllabification exists. There are two broad approaches: rule-based and data-driven. The rule-based method effectively embodies some theoretical position regarding the syllable, whereas the data-driven paradigm tries to infer "new" syllabifications from examples assumed to be correctly syllabified already. This article compares the performance of several variants of the two basic approaches. Given the problems of definition, it is difficult to determine a correct syllabification in all cases and so to establish the quality of the "gold standard" corpus used either to evaluate quantitatively the output of an automatic algorithm or as the example-set on which data-driven methods crucially depend. Thus, we look for consensus in the entries in multiple lexical databases of pre-syllabified words. In this work, we have used two independent lexicons, and extracted from them the same 18,016 words with their corresponding (possibly different) syllabifications. We have also created a third lexicon corresponding to the 13,594 words that share the same syllabifications in these two sources. As well as two rule-based approaches (Hammond's and Fisher's implementation of Kahn's), three data-driven techniques are evaluated: a look-up procedure, an exemplar-based generalization technique, and syllabification by analogy (SbA). The results on the three databases show consistent and robust patterns. First, the data-driven techniques outperform the rule-based systems in word and juncture accuracies by a very significant margin but require training data and are slower. Second, syllabification in the pronunciation domain is easier than in the spelling domain. Finally, best results are consistently obtained with SbA. (Contains 9 tables, 4 figures and 7 footnotes.)},

Abstract = {The systematic presentation of collocations is increasingly recognized as a very useful addition to specialized reference works. However, few dictionaries or terminological databases actually include this kind of data. More surprisingly still, no method has been designed yet to allow efficient access to and retrieval of specific specialized collocations from electronic reference tools. This article presents two new search paths for accessing and extracting collocations from an English-French specialized lexical database. The paths have been designed according to two specific user-defined situations: (1) translation from L1 to L2; and (2) text production in L2. We exploit a formal semantic encoding of collocations based on Lexical Functions (LFs). LFs allow us to establish an equivalence relationship between collocations that convey the same meaning in different languages without having to link the collocations formally. They also allow us to extract sets of collocations associated wit)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the deficits of metaphor and sarcasm comprehension in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as pragmatic interpretation such as metaphor and sarcasm comprehension is required in social communication. A total of 31 young normal controls, 104 aged normal controls (ANC), 42 patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 30 patients with mild AD were evaluated by Metaphoric and Sarcastic Scenario Test, which consists of 5 metaphoric and 5 sarcastic questions with 5 answer choices. Scores were analyzed using the repeated measures analysis of variance (metaphor/sarcasm vs 4 participant groups). Sarcasm comprehension, which requires second-order Theory of Mind (ToM), started to deteriorate in ANC, and metaphor comprehension, which requires first-order ToM, started to deteriorate in aMCI, and both deteriorated as disease progressed. Literal interpretation of pragmatic language is characteristic in patients with mild AD. Such misinterpretation would result in social miscommunication, even if they still retained semantic-lexical competence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {How does experience influence children’s acquisition of word meanings? In this chapter, the authors discuss the evidence from two bodies of literature that take different perspectives to answer this question. First, they review evidence from the 'experience' literature, which has demonstrated that different experiential factors (e.g., differences in the quantity and quality of maternal speech) are related to individual differences in children’s early vocabularies. Although the results of the studies within this literature are interesting, the authors argue that they do not clarify how experience influences children’s vocabulary development. They posit that this question can best be answered by marrying the 'experience' literature and the 'cognitive' literature, which has identified the skills and knowledge that children possess that help them determine the meanings of words. The authors demonstrate how integrating both literatures will provide a valuable framework from which research can be designed and hypotheses tested. In doing so, their framework will provide a comprehensive understanding of how experience influences children’s lexical development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: Event-related potentials (ERPs) like N200 and P300 have been reported to reflect the categorical perception of speech. The purpose of the present study is to explore whether these ERP components reflect the influence of lexical context on categorical perception. Findings may provide evidence for bottom-up or top-down processing of speech. Methods: On a seven step series of the /bi/-/pi/ continuum, a two-forced choice labeling test was administered in two conditions: /bi/ context (e.g. bee sting) and /pi/ context (e.g. pea soup). From the labeling results, Stimulus 1which is a prototypical /bi/ was selected for standard stimuli, and Stimulus 4 which showed the greatest effect of context of the between-category was selected as the deviant in an active oddball paradigm commonly used to obtain N200 and P300 ERPs. After subjects finished a two-forced choice labeling test, they participated in electrophysiological testing while simultaneously pressing a response button when they heard the deviant stimuli. A total of 450 stimuli composed of 369 standard stimuli (81%) and 81 deviant stimuli (19%) were presented in an active oddball paradigm for /bi/ and /pi/ context word conditions, respectively. ERP responses were measured using 9 electrodes from 21 normal hearing adults. Electrophysiological data (amplitude and latency of N200 and P300) and behavioral data (labeling, discrimination response accuracy, discrimination reaction time) were analyzed. Results: (1) The amplitude and latency of N200 and P300 did not represent the change in categorical perception in the presence of lexical context that was demonstrated in the labeling task, (2) N200 amplitude was the largest over the frontal region while P300 was the largest over the parietal region, (3) discrimination reaction time was faster in the /pi/ context condition than /bi/ context condition while response accuracy did not differ with context, and (4) there was no correlation between N200/P300 and behavioral data. Conclusion: N200 and P300 do not reflect the lexical effect on pre-lexical processing of categorical speech stimuli. Findings suggest that lexical context does not affect electrophysiological measures of pre-lexical speech processing (e.g., N200 or P300), supporting the autonomous (bottom-up) model that speech perception influenced by lexical context (as demonstrated behaviorally) occurs on the post-lexical level.

Abstract = {Lexical organization in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is not fully understood. This study investigated the nature of word association in individuals with ASD using two experimental paradigms: a word association task (Experiment 1), followed by an individualized semantic priming task (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, participants were asked to name as many semantically related words as possible when auditorily presented with a target (e.g., participants heard the word cat and were asked to name semantically related words, within 60 seconds). In Experiment 2, participants were asked to name a target picture, preceded in time by 50 ms. Four types of auditory primes were used: Associated (e.g., bird-nest), Individual Semantic (e.g., bird-(tree)), Identity (e.g., bird-bird), and Unrelated (e.g., bird-car). The primes in the Individual Semantic condition were semantic associates obtained from responses in Experiment 1. Participants were 15 individuals with ASD (aged 14;0 to 19;2), 16 with typical language development matched for chronological age (CAM) (aged 15;0 to 19;7), and 14 with typical language development matched for raw score (VM) on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test 4 th ed (aged 8;1 to 13;4) (Dunn & Dunn, 2007). In Experiment 1, while individuals with ASD produced many appropriate word associations, they also produced more unrelated word associations than both control groups. In Experiment 2, participants' reaction times revealed that individuals with ASD performed similarly to both control groups in all conditions: they exhibited priming in the Identity condition, but not in the Associated and Individual Semantic conditions. Absence of group x condition interaction in the Associated condition calls method into question. Results from Experiment 1 suggest that individuals with ASD have a similarly organized lexicon (i.e., more associated than unrelated responses to a given target), but the breadth and depth of their lexicons may be immature (i.e., higher proportion of unrelated responses, relative to both control groups). Findings have clinical and educational implications for vocabulary instruction in individuals with ASD. Word associations may first appear to be typical. However, in-depth analyses (i.e., monitoring associated, perseveration, proper noun, phrase, or unrelated responses), provides robust information regarding lexical organization.

Abstract = {Emotion is a multifaceted phenomenon affecting many and varied areas of human experience, which calls for a multidisciplinary approach in its investigation. The GRID project presented in this volume offers one such approach, integrating psychological, anthropological, and linguistic insight into a unified research agenda. Previous chapters have contextualized the GRID from a number of disciplinary orientations relevant to the paradigm, but since the study is first and foremost a linguistic one, given that it aims to describe the meaning of emotion words across languages and cultures, the goal of this chapter is to provide a theoretical framework for the paradigm and an explanation of its contribution from the point of view of linguistics and, more specifically, lexical semantics. The approach will also be compared with other methodologies available in the field for the study of lexical meaning. Among them the GRID is the only paradigm specifically designed to describe the meaning of emotion terms. The chapter is divided in two sections devoted to theories and methodologies, respectively. In the first one, we give an overview of three main areas of concern in lexical semantics and how they have been addressed by modern theories of lexical meaning. This will allow us to point out the advantages and disadvantages of each theoretical stance for the study of emotion, as well as to identify which one lends itself better to interdisciplinary research. In the second section, we give an overview of four of the most productive methodologies currently employed in the study of emotion term semantics. This will be important to identify in what sense and to what extent the GRID methodology can complement already existing approaches to the study of emotion words. But before we proceed, two caveats need to be considered. First, this chapter focuses on the meaning of lexical units. Larger units of meaning, like the phrase or the sentence, will not be dealt with. Second, we will focus on decontextualized meaning, that is, off-line semantic representation. These two decisions are based on the nature of the GRID paradigm itself, designed to investigate the meaning of decontextualized lexical units.

Abstract = {Early in development, many word‐learning phenomena generalize to symbolic gestures. The current study explored whether children avoid lexical overlap in the gestural modality, as they do in the verbal modality, within the context of ambiguous reference. Eighteen‐month‐olds’ interpretations of words and symbolic gestures in a symbol‐disambiguation task (Experiment 1) and a symbol‐learning task (Experiment 2) were investigated. In Experiment 1 (N = 32), children avoided verbal lexical overlap, mapping novel words to unnamed objects; children failed to display this pattern with symbolic gestures. In Experiment 2 (N = 32), 18‐month‐olds mapped both novel words and novel symbolic gestures onto their referents. Implications of these findings for the specialized nature of word learning and the development of lexical overlap avoidance are discussed.

Abstract = {Purpose: In aphasic patients, some studies have already emphasized the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during the treatment of noun retrieval deficits. To date, in the same population, there are have been no studies addressing tDCS effects in the recovery of verb retrieval deficits. In this study, we wanted to test the potential of tDCS to improve verb production in a group of aphasic patients. Methods: Seven chronic subjects participated in an intensive language training for their difficulties in action naming. Each subject was treated with tDCS (20 min., 1 mA) over the left hemisphere in three different conditions: anodic tDCS over Wernicke’s area, anodic tDCS and sham stimulation over Broca’s area. Each experimental condition was performed in five consecutive daily sessions over three weeks with 6 days of intersession interval. Results: In all patients, results showed a significantly better response accuracy during the anodic tDCS over Broca’s area with respect to the other two conditions which still persisted at one month after the end of the treatment suggesting a long-term effect on the recovery of their verb retrieval deficits. Conclusion: These findings further confirm that tDCS represents a useful new therapeutic interventions for the rehabilitation of lexical deficits in aphasic patients.

Abstract = {The goal of the present study was to investigate event-related potential (ERP) responses to Dutch negative and positive polarity adverbs of degree presented in licensed and unlicensed contexts with negative and affirmative particles directly preceding the polarity item. To control for effects of the processing of negation as such, neutral adverbs were also presented in negative and affirmative contexts. The results did not show any significant effect of negation for the non-polar adverbs, allowing context effects for polarity items to be interpreted as being due to the appropriateness of the context. Negative polarity violations elicited an N400 response that might reflect the lack of semantic congruity of the negative polarity item in an affirmative context. In contrast, processing positive polarity items in context of negation resulted in a positive effect resembling the P600, which may be considered as a marker of a different sort of integration difficulty caused by violation of licensing conditions and/or a search for a licensor in the wider discourse context. The study presented here is the first to show an unambiguous dissociation between responses to negative and positive polarity violations. This dissociation argues for different mechanisms underlying the processing of these two types of polarity; we propose that positive polarity items are sensitive to wider discourse context, while negative polarity items are more sensitive to local lexical context.

Abstract = {Background: Acquired phonological dysgraphia refers to impaired spelling of nonwords with preserved spelling of familiar words as well as effects of grammatical class on word spelling with nouns spelled better than verbs. Despite the reports of acquired phonological dysgraphia in different languages, no study has investigated acquired phonological dysgraphia in a bilingual speaker. Aims: Our aim is to test the hypothesis that patterns of spelling impairment should be similar in each language for AA who is a highly proficient bilingual Greek-English speaker with phonological dysgraphia in each language. Methods & Procedures: Phonological dysgraphia was assessed using tasks of spelling to dictation with familiar words, nonwords and verbs and nouns in each language. Outcomes & Results: AA was impaired on tasks that require the knowledge of phoneme to grapheme correspondences in both Greek and English resulting in impaired nonword spelling. In English, nouns were spelled better than verbs; however, the reverse pattern was seen in Greek, with verbs spelled better than nouns. Conclusions: Differential effects of grammatical class on spelling across languages in bilingual phonological dysgraphia reveal that the linguistic constraints of each language have an impact on spelling via a lexical–semantic spelling pathway.

When matched for vocabulary size, children with ASD and children in the LDS normative sample did not differ in semantic category or word-class scores. Q correlations were large when percentage use scores for the ASD sample were compared with those for samples of typically developing children as well as children with vocabularies < 50 words. The 57 words with the highest percentage use scores for the ASD children were primarily nouns, represented a variety of semantic categories, and overlapped substantially with the words having highest percentage use scores in samples of typically developing children as well as children with lexicons of < 50 words. Results indicated that the children with ASD were acquiring essentially the same words as typically developing children, suggesting delayed but not deviant lexical composition.

Abstract = {The substantial increase of social networks and their combination with mobile devices make rigorous analysis of the outcomes of such system of paramount importance for intelligence gathering and decision making purposes. Since the introduction of Twitter system in 2006, tweeting emerged as an efficient open social network that attracted interest from various research/commercial and military communities. This paper investigates the current software architecture of Twitter system and put forward a new architecture dedicated for semantic and spatial analysis of Twitter data. Especially, Twitter Streaming API was used as a basis for tweet collection data stored in MySQL like database. While Lucene system together with WordNet lexical database linked to advanced natural language processing and PostGIS platform were used to ensure semantic and spatial analysis of the collected data. A functional diversity approach was implemented to enforce fault tolerance for the data collection part where its performances were evaluated through comparison with alternative approaches. The proposal enables the discovery of spatial patterns within geo-located Twitter and can provide the user or operator with useful unforeseen elements.

Abstract = {Reciprocal relations between emerging morphological processes and reading skills were examined in a longitudinal study tracking children from Grade 1 through Grade 3. The aim was to examine predictive relationships between productive morphological processing involving composing and decomposing of inflections and derivations, reading ability for pseudoword and word decoding, and word and passage reading comprehension after controlling for initial abilities in reading, morphological processing, phonological awareness, and vocabulary. Reciprocal influences were indicated by predictive relations among initial morphological processes and later reading abilities co-occurring with relationships between initial reading abilities and later morphological processes. Using multilevel modeling, decomposing and composing were found to predict emerging word decoding and word and passage comprehension but not pseudoword decoding. Reading comprehension predicted growth in decomposing. Subsequent regression analyses of model-estimated early linear growth in predictors and later linear growth in outcomes showed that early growth in morphological processes predicted later growth in word decoding and passage comprehension. Although reciprocal relations between emerging morphological processes and reading skills were observed, the different patterns on each side of the reciprocal 'coin' indicated that the mechanisms underlying predictive influences are likely different but related to quality of lexical representations.

Profiling (specific) language impairment in bilingual children: preliminary evidence from Cyprus. In V. C. Mueller Gathercole (Ed.), Bilinguals and assessment: State-of-the-art guide to issues and solutions from around the world. Bristol: Multilingual Matters, in press.] Children with specific language impairment (SLI) have particular problems using verbs. However, not much is known about how children with SLI retrieve different types of verbs. In the present study, bilectal Greek-speaking children with and without SLI were assessed on naming of different verbs held constant for argument structure but manipulated for lexical-semantic and phonological-lexical features. School-aged children with SLI as well as typically developing age and vocabulary-matched peers named 39 colored photographs representing actions in a confrontation naming task. Stimuli included actions involving an instrument (e.g., sweeping), i.e. instrumental verbs, and actions that have a name-relation with the instrument (e.g., sawing), i.e. name-related instrumental verbs as well as actions not involving an instrument (e.g., climbing), i.e. non-instrumental verbs. Instrumental verbs were significantly more difficult to retrieve than non-instrumental verbs for children with SLI and typically language-developing controls. In contrast, instrumental verbs with a name relation to the noun were significantly easier to name than instrumental verbs without a name relation for all groups. Children with SLI performed on par with vocabulary-matched peers. The results based on error types suggest that the greater difficulties children with SLI have with action naming is lexical-semantic in nature.

Abstract = {Abstract: A novel modeling method for a collection of short text snippets is presented in this paper to measure the similarity between pairs of snippets. The method takes account of both the semantic and statistical information within the short text snippets, and consists of three steps. Given a set of raw short text snippets, it first establishes the initial similarity between words by using a lexical database. The method then iteratively calculates both word similarity and short text similarity. Finally, a proximity matrix is constructed based on word similarity and used to convert the raw text snippets into vectors. Word similarity and text clustering experiments show that the proposed short text modeling method improves the performance of existing text-related information retrieval (IR) techniques.

Abstract = {The current study investigated whether bilingualism affects the processing of sub-lexical representations specifying the sound structure of words. Spanish-English bilinguals, Mandarin-English bilinguals, and English-only monolinguals repeated English tongue twisters. Twister materials had word or nonword targets (thus varying in whether lexical information did or did not support sound processing), and similar or dissimilar sounds (thus varying in difficulty with respect to competition at a sub-lexical level). Even though bilinguals had learned English at an early age, and spoke English without an accent, Spanish-English bilinguals produced significantly more twister errors than monolinguals, particularly in the absence of lexical support. Mandarin-English bilinguals were also disadvantaged, but more consistently across all twister types. These results reveal that bilingual disadvantages extend beyond the lexical level to affect the processing of sub-lexical representations. More generally, these findings suggest that experience with sound structures (and not simply their intrinsic complexity) shapes sub-lexical processing for all speakers.

Abstract = {Rhyme processing is reflected in the electrophysiological signals of the brain as a negative deflection for non-rhyming as compared to rhyming stimuli around 450 ms after stimulus onset. Studies have shown that this N450 component is not solely sensitive to rhyme but also responds to other types of phonological overlap. In the present study, we examined whether the N450 component can be used to gain insight into the global similarity effect, indicating that rhyme judgment skills decrease when participants are presented with word pairs that share a phonological overlap but do not rhyme (e.g., bell–ball). We presented 20 adults with auditory rhyming, globally similar overlapping and unrelated word pairs. In addition to measuring behavioral responses by means of a yes/no button press, we also took EEG measures. The behavioral data showed a clear global similarity effect; participants judged overlapping pairs more slowly than unrelated pairs. However, the neural outcomes did not provide evidence that the N450 effect responds differentially to globally similar and unrelated word pairs, suggesting that globally similar and dissimilar non-rhyming pairs are processed in a similar fashion at the stage of early lexical access.

Abstract = {Recent data suggest that word valence modulates subsequent cognitive processing. However, the contribution of word arousal is less understood. In this study, behavioral and electrophysiological measures to neutral nouns and pseudowords that were preceded by either a high-arousal or a low-arousal word were recorded during a lexical decision task. Effects were found at an electrophysiological level. Target words and pseudowords elicited enhanced N100 amplitudes when they were preceded by high- compared to low-arousing words. This effect may reflect perceptual potentiation during the allocation of attentional resources when the new stimulus is processed. Enhanced amplitudes in a late positivity when target words and pseudowords followed high-arousal primes were also observed, which could be related to sustained attention during supplementary analyses at a post-lexical level.

Abstract = {This study investigates how bilinguals use sublexical language membership information to speed up their word recognition process in different task situations. Norwegian–English bilinguals performed a Norwegian–English language decision task, a mixed English lexical decision task, or a mixed Norwegian lexical decision task. The mixed lexical decision experiments included words from the non-target language that required a 'no' response. The language specificity of the Bokmål (a Norwegian written norm) and English (non)words was varied by including language-specific letters ('smør', 'hawk') or bigrams ('dusj', 'veal'). Bilinguals were found to use both types of sublexical markedness to facilitate their decisions, language-specific letters leading to larger effects than language-specific bigrams. A cross-experimental comparison indicates that the use of sublexical language information was strategically dependent on the task at hand and that decisions were based on language membership information derived directly from sublexical (bigram) stimulus characteristics instead of indirectly via their lexical representations. Available models for bilingual word recognition fail to handle the observed marker effects, because all consider language membership as a lexical property only.

Abstract = {The current work examines children's sensitivity to rime unit spelling–sound correspondences within the context of early word reading as a way of assessing word‐specific influences on early word‐reading strategies. Sixty 6–7‐year‐olds participated in an experimental reading task that comprised word items that shared either frequent or infrequent rime unit correspondences. Retrospective self‐reports were taken as measures of strategy choice. The results showed that the children were more accurate in identifying word items that shared a common rime unit (consistent items) when compared with those containing infrequent rime units (unique and exception items). Moreover, while nonlexical (phonological) attempts were most frequently applied across all word types, these resulted in lower levels of accuracy, especially for the exception word items. The current data support the argument that children are increasingly sensitive to rime unit sound–spelling correspondences during the early stages of their word reading and the nature of these word‐specific orthographic representations shape their reliance on using particular lexical or non‐lexical‐based word‐reading strategies.

Abstract = {Printed words that have a transposed-letter (TL) neighbor (e.g., angel has the TL neighbor angle) have been shown to be more difficult to process, in a range of paradigms, than words that do not have a TL neighbor. However, eye movement evidence suggests that this processing difficulty may occur on only a subset of trials. To investigate this issue, here we fit the ex-Gaussian distribution to naming latencies. The presence of a TL neighbor affected the τ parameter of the distribution of latencies, but there was no effect on the μ parameter. Vincentile plots confirmed that only slow responses were affected by the presence of a TL neighbor. These results contrast with the distributional effects of other variables on naming latency and are interpreted as suggesting that the TL effect involves inhibition of an incorrect output rather than broader competition between lexical entries.

Abstract = {This article reports findings from 3 experiments examining whether 2nd language (L2) words are represented in episodic memory, as originally proposed by Jiang and Forster (2001). Experiment 1 was a direct replication of Jiang and Forster, testing highly proficient Chinese–English bilinguals. Masked translation priming was obtained in an episodic recognition task from L2 to the 1st language (L1) for studied 'old' L1 targets but not for unstudied 'new' targets. This experiment also confirmed the translation asymmetry generally found in lexical decision tasks, namely, priming in the L1–L2 direction but not in the L2–L1 direction. Experiment 2 showed that recently learned words in an unfamiliar language (therefore, words that are obviously represented episodically) could also prime their L1 translations in an episodic recognition task but not in a lexical decision task. Finally, in Experiment 3, masked repetition priming was used with an episodic recognition memory task. For native speakers of English, repetition (L1–L1) priming is obtained only for old words, because there is no episodic representation for new words. However, Chinese–English bilinguals tested with the same items showed repetition (L2–L2) priming for both old and new words, indicating that the new L2 words were represented episodically as well. Overall, the results from these 3 experiments support the hypothesis that L2 words are represented in episodic memory. Finally, the mechanisms behind why L2–L1 translation priming can be obtained in episodic recognition and not in lexical decision are discussed.

Abstract = {Two auditory lexical decision experiments document for morphologically complex words two points at which the probability of a target word given the evidence shifts dramatically. The first point is reached when morphologically unrelated competitors are no longer compatible with the evidence. Adapting terminology from Marslen-Wilson (1984), we refer to this as the word’s initial uniqueness point (UP1). The second point is the complex uniqueness point (CUP) introduced by Balling and Baayen (2008), at which morphologically related competitors become incompatible with the input. Later initial as well as complex uniqueness points predict longer response latencies. We argue that the effects of these uniqueness points arise due to the large surprisal (Levy, 2008) carried by the phonemes at these uniqueness points, and provide independent evidence that how cumulative surprisal builds up in the course of the word co-determines response latencies. The presence of effects of surprisal, both at the initial uniqueness point of complex words, and cumulatively throughout the word, challenges the Shortlist B model of Norris and McQueen (2008), and suggests that a Bayesian approach to auditory comprehension requires complementation from information theory in order to do justice to the cognitive cost of updating probability distributions over lexical candidates.

Abstract = {Patients with anterior temporal lobe (ATL) lesions show semantic and lexical retrieval deficits, and the differential role of this area in the 2 processes is debated. Functional neuroimaging in healthy individuals has not clarified the matter because semantic and lexical processes usually occur simultaneously and automatically. Furthermore, the ATL is a region challenging for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) due to susceptibility artifacts, especially at high fields. In this study, we established an optimized ATL-sensitive fMRI acquisition protocol at 4 T and applied an event-related paradigm to study the identification (i.e., association of semantic biographical information) of celebrities, with and without the ability to retrieve their proper names. While semantic processing reliably activated the ATL, only more posterior areas in the left temporal and temporal–parietal junction were significantly modulated by covert lexical retrieval. These results suggest that within a temporoparietal network, the ATL is relatively more important for semantic processing, and posterior language regions are relatively more important for lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {Despite a number of research studies investigating the Yes–No vocabulary test format, one main question remains unanswered: What is the best scoring procedure to adjust for testee overestimation of vocabulary knowledge? Different scoring methodologies have been proposed based on the inclusion and selection of nonwords in the test. However, there is currently no consensus on the best adjustment procedure using these nonwords. Two studies were conducted to examine a new methodology for scoring Yes–No tests based on testees’ response times (RTs) to the words in the test, on the assumption that faster responses would be more certain and accurate whereas more hesitant and inaccurate ones would be reflected in slower RTs. Participants performed a timed Yes–No test and were then interviewed to ascertain their actual vocabulary knowledge. Study 1 explored the viability of this approach and Study 2 examined whether the RT approach presented any advantage over the more traditional nonword approaches. Results showed that there was no clear advantage for any of the approaches under comparison, but their effectiveness depended on factors like the false alarm rate and the size of participants’ overestimation of their lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {In the lexical ambiguity literature, it is well-established that readers experience processing difficulties when they encounter biased homographs in a subordinate-instantiating prior context (i.e., the subordinate bias effect). To investigate the time course of this effect, the present study examined distributional analyses of first-fixation durations on 60 biased homographs that were each read twice: once in a subordinate-instantiating context and once in a dominant-instantiating context. Ex-Gaussian fitting revealed that the subordinate context distribution was shifted to the right of the dominant context distribution, with no significant contextual differences in the degree of skew. In addition, a survival analysis technique showed a significant influence of the subordinate versus dominant contextual manipulation as early as 139 ms from the start of fixation. These results indicate that the contextual manipulation had a fast-acting influence on the majority of fixation durations, which is consistent with the reordered access model’s assumption that prior context can affect the lexical access stage of reading.

Abstract = {In the investigation of orthographic representation of Chinese characters, one question that has stimulated much research is whether radicals (character components) are specified for spatial position in a character (e.g., Ding et al., 2004; Tsang and Chen, 2009). Differing from previous work, component or radical position information in this study is conceived in terms of relative frequency across different positions of characters containing it. A lexical decision task in a masked priming paradigm focusing on radicals with preferred position of occurrence was conducted. A radical position that encompasses more characters than other positions was identified to be the preferred position of a particular radical. The prime that was exposed for 96 ms might share a radical with the target in the same or different positions. Moreover, the shared radical appeared either in its preferred or non-preferred position in the target. While response latencies only revealed the effect of graphical similarity, both effects of graphical similarity and radical position preference were found in the event-related potential (ERP) results. The former effect was reflected in greater positivity in occipital P1 and greater negativity in N400 for radicals in different positions in prime and target characters. The latter effect manifested as greater negativity in occipital N170 and greater positivity in frontal P200 in the same time window elicited by radicals in their non-preferred position. Equally interesting was the reversal of the effect of radical position preference in N400 with greater negativity associated with radicals in preferred position. These findings identify the early ERP components associated with activation of position-specific radical representations in the orthographic lexicon, and reveal the change in the nature of competition from processing at the radical level to the lexical level.

Abstract = {The paper reports on a perception experiment in German that investigated the neuro-cognitive processing of information structural concepts and their prosodic marking using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Experimental conditions controlled the information status (given vs. new) of referring and non-referring target expressions (nouns vs. adjectives) and were elicited via context sentences, which did not—unlike most previous ERP studies in the field—trigger an explicit focus expectation. Target utterances displayed prosodic realizations of the critical words which differed in accent position and accent type. Electrophysiological results showed an effect of information status, maximally distributed over posterior sites, displaying a biphasic N400—Late Positivity pattern for new information. We claim that this pattern reflects increased processing demands associated with new information, with the N400 indicating enhanced costs from linking information with the previous discourse and the Late Positivity indicating the listener’s effort to update his/her discourse model. The prosodic manipulation registered more pronounced effects over anterior regions and revealed an enhanced negativity followed by a Late Positivity for deaccentuation, probably also reflecting costs from discourse linking and updating respectively. The data further lend indirect support for the idea that givenness applies not only to referents but also to non-referential expressions (‘lexical givenness’).

Abstract = {Although research has consistently shown that a bilingual’s two languages interact on multiple levels, it is also well-established that bilinguals can vary considerably in their proficiency in the second language (L2). In this paper we review empirical studies that have examined how differences in L2 proficiency modulate cross-language co-activation and interaction during bilingual lexical processing. We review studies investigating cognate and homograph processing in visual word perception and word production, auditory word perception using the visual world paradigm, and cross-language priming, focusing specifically on how differences in proficiency modulate co-activation during lexical access.We further discuss differences in L2 proficiency in relation to immersion and age of L2 acquisition, how differences in L2 proficiency relate to neurocognitive aspects of cognitive control, and how changes in L2 proficiency relative to L1 proficiency may affect lexical processing.

Abstract = {Recent findings have argued in favor of the categorical perception of tonal contrasts in Taiwanese Mandarin and Standard Mandarin (Hallé, Chang, & Best, 2004; Xu, Gandour, & Francis, 2006), and most recently in Mandarin and Cantonese (Peng et al., 2010). Findings in favor of the categorical perception of tone emerge most clearly from cross-linguistic work on speech perception. The current study continues this line of research by investigating the categorical perception of Itunyoso Trique tone among Trique and French listeners. Tonal stimuli were presented to listeners in an AXB discrimination task (2AFC) and an AXB identification task (2AFC), closely following methods used in Hallé et al. (2004). Evidence for a listener sensitivity to tonal categories was found for Trique listeners in their discrimination performance, but this pattern did not correspond to the identification performance. Overall, French speakers performed better overall at tone discrimination than Trique listeners, who largely ignored within-category phonetic differences. Both Trique and French listeners were found to be sensitive to psychoacoustic differences between stimuli, though French speakers relied more heavily on such differences. The findings here argue for the importance of both phonetic and auditory memory for the perception of Trique lexical tone. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate individual differences in the influence of lexical association on word recognition during auditory sentence processing. Lexical associations among individual words (e.g. salt and pepper) represent one type of semantic information that is available during the processing of words in context. We predicted that individuals would vary in their sensitivity to this type of local context as a function of suppression ability and working-memory capacity. Lexical association was manipulated in auditory sentence contexts, and multiple regression analyses were employed to examine the relation between individuals’ brain responses to meaning relations in sentences and measures of working-memory capacity, cognitive control and vocabulary. Lexical association influenced the processing of words that were embedded in sentences and also showed a great deal of individual variability. Specifically, suppression ability emerged as a significant predictor of sensitivity to lexical association, such that individuals who performed poorly on our measure of suppression ability (the Stroop task), compared to those who performed well, showed larger N400 effects of lexical association.

Abstract = {In order to achieve further insight into the comorbidity of reading disorder (RD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), lexical processing and rapid naming were studied in RD and ADHD. The Dual Route Cascaded model postulates that lexical processing contains two parallel processes: lexical route processing and sublexical route processing. An orthographic decision task and a phonological decision task were used to measure lexical and sublexical route processing, respectively. In addition, a rapid naming task was used to compare 27 children with RD, 18 children with ADHD, 20 children with ADHD+RD, and 29 controls. RD and ADHD shared impairments in accuracy of orthographic and phonological decision making as well as in rapid naming, which suggest that RD and ADHD may be overlapping disorders that share deficits in both lexical route and sublexical route processing. RD was dissociated from ADHD by being slower in both orthographical and phonological decision making that indicates unique deficits in RD on lexical and sublexical speed.

Abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of between-talker differences in accent and dialect, little is known about how listeners adjust to this source of variability as language is perceived in real time. In three experiments, we examined whether, and when, listeners can use specific knowledge of a particular talker’s accent during online speech processing. Listeners were exposed to the speech of two talkers, a male who had an unfamiliar regional dialect of American English, in which the /æ/ vowel is raised to /eI/ only before /g/ (e.g., bag is pronounced /beIg/), and a female talker without the dialect. In order to examine how knowledge of a particular talker’s accent influenced language processing, we examined listeners’ interpretation of unaccented words such as back and bake in contexts that included a competitor like bag. If interpretation processes are talker-specific, the pattern of competition from bag should vary depending on how that talker pronounces the competitor word. In all three experiments, listeners rapidly used their knowledge of how the talker would have pronounced bag to either rule out or include bag as a temporary competitor. Providing a cue to talker identity prior to the critical word strengthened these effects. These results are consistent with views of language processing in which multiple sources of information, including previous experience with the current talker and contextual cues, are rapidly integrated during lexical activation and selection processes.

Abstract = {Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in accounts motivated by information theory that consider language production to be partially driven by a preference for communicative efficiency. Evidence from discourse production (i.e., production beyond the sentence level) has been argued to suggest that speakers distribute information across discourse so as to hold the conditional per‐word entropy associated with each word constant, which would facilitate efficient information transfer (Genzel & Charniak, 2002). This hypothesis implies that the conditional (contextualized) probabilities of linguistic units affect speakers’ preferences during production. Here, we extend this work in two ways. First, we explore how preceding cues are integrated into contextualized probabilities, a question which so far has received little to no attention. Specifically, we investigate how a cue's maximal informativity about upcoming words (the cue's effectiveness) decays as a function of the cue's recency. Based on properties of linguistic discourses as well as properties of human memory, we analytically derive a model of cue effectiveness decay and evaluate it against cross‐linguistic data from 12 languages. Second, we relate the information theoretic accounts of discourse production to well‐established mechanistic (activation‐based) accounts: We relate contextualized probability distributions over words to their relative activation in a lexical network given preceding discourse.

Abstract = {Background: Loss of fluency is a significant source of functional impairment in many individuals with aphasia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) administered to the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) has been shown to facilitate naming in persons with chronic left hemisphere stroke and non-fluent aphasia. However, changes in fluency in aphasic participants receiving rTMS have not been adequately explored. Aims: To determine whether rTMS improves fluency in individuals with chronic nonfluent aphasia, and to identify aspects of fluency that are modulated in persons who respond to rTMS. Methods & Procedures: Ten individuals with left hemisphere MCA strokes and mild to moderate non-fluent aphasia participated in the study. Before treatment participants were asked to describe the Cookie Theft picture in three separate sessions. During treatment all participants received 1200 pulses of 1 Hz rTMS daily in 10 sessions over 2 weeks at a site that had previously been shown to improve naming. Participants repeated the Cookie Theft description 2 months after treatment. Five participants initially received sham stimulation instead of real TMS; 2 months after sham treatment these individuals received real rTMS. Performance both at baseline and after stimulation was coded using Quantitative Production Analysis (Saffran, Berndt, & Schwartz, 1989) and Correct Information Unit (Nicholas & Brookshire, 1993) analysis. Outcomes & Results: Across all participants (n = 10), real rTMS treatment resulted in a significant increase in multiple measures of discourse productivity compared to baseline performance. There was no significant increase in measures of sentence productivity or grammatical accuracy. There was no significant increase from baseline in the sham condition (n = 5) on any study measures. Conclusions: Stimulation of the right IFG in patients with chronic non-fluent aphasia facilitates discourse production. We posit that this effect may be attributable to improved lexical-semantic access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to propose an outline of a model of the representational lexicon in Functional Discourse Grammar. Some problems with the mainstream account of the lexicon are discussed in the context of prior work by García Velasco (2007). It is proposed that structure building, including the choice of an appropriate predication frame, is mediated through the selection of lexical items to realise the concepts the language user wishes to express, and that although decompositional accounts of the lexicon need enrichment to account for lexical competence, they are still required, though at the conceptual level. It is then proposed that the link between lexical items and the Conceptual Component of the model should take the form of pointers from lexical items to a conceptual ontology, and that this ontology should be language-neutral across a range of culturally-related languages. It is shown that the FunGramKB system of ontology and lexica, developed in association with the Lexical Constructional Model, can be adapted for use in Functional Discourse Grammar. The article then discusses the handling of alternations, collocations and lexical variation with situational content. Suggestions are also made for the treatment of prefabricated expressions which combine grammatical and lexical characteristics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Theories of lexical production differ in whether they allow phonological processes to affect lexical selection directly. Whereas some accounts, such as interactive activation accounts, predict (weak) early effects of phonological processes during lexical selection via feedback connections, strictly serial architectures do not make this prediction. We present evidence from lexical selection during unscripted sentence production that lexical selection is affected by the phonological form of recently produced words. In a video description experiment, participants described scenes that were compatible with several near-meaning-equivalent verbs. We found that speakers were less likely than expected by chance to select a verb form that would result in phonological onset overlap with the subject of the sentence. Additional evidence from the distribution of disfluencies immediately preceding the verb argues that this effect is due to early effects on lexical selection, rather than later corrective processes, such as self-monitoring. Taken together, these findings support accounts that allow early feedback from phonological processes to word-level nodes, even during lexical selection.

Abstract = {Recent studies report that the occipito-temporal N170 component of the ERP is enhanced by letter strings, relative to non-linguistic strings of similar visual complexity, with a left-lateralized distribution. This finding is consistent with underlying mechanisms that serve visual word recognition. Conclusions about the level of analysis reflected within the N170 effects, and therefore the timecourse of word recognition, have been mixed. Here, we investigated the timing and nature of brain responses to putatively low- and high-level processing difficulty. Low-level processing difficulty was modulated by manipulating letter-rotation parametrically at 0°, 22.5°, 45°, 67.5°, and 90°. Higher-level processing difficulty was modulated by manipulating lexical status (words vs. word-like pseudowords). Increasing letter-rotation enhanced the N170 led to monotonic increases in P1 and N170 amplitude up to 67.5° but then decreased amplitude at 90°. Pseudowords enhanced the N170 over left occipital-temporal sites, relative to words. These combined findings are compatible with a cascaded, interactive architecture in which lower-level analysis (e.g., word-form feature extraction) leads higher-level analysis (e.g., lexical access) in time, but that by approximately 170 ms, the brain's response to a visual word includes parallel, interactive processing at both low-level feature extraction and higher-order lexical access levels of analysis.

Abstract = {How bilinguals represent words in two languages and which mechanisms are responsible for second language acquisition are important questions in the bilingual and vocabulary acquisition literature. This study aims to analyse the effect of two learning methods (picture‐ vs. word‐based method) and two types of words (cognates and non‐cognates) in early stages of children's L2 acquisition. Forty‐eight native speakers of European Portuguese, all sixth graders (mean age = 10.87 years; SD = 0.85), participated in the study. None of them had prior knowledge of Basque (the L2 in this study). After a learning phase in which L2 words were learned either by a picture‐ or a word‐based method, children were tested in a backward‐word translation recognition task at two times (immediately vs. one week later). Results showed that the participants made more errors when rejecting semantically related than semantically unrelated words as correct translations (semantic interference effect). The magnitude of this effect was higher in the delayed test condition regardless of the learning method. Moreover, the overall performance of participants from the word‐based method was better than the performance of participants from the picture‐word method. Results were discussed concerning the most significant bilingual lexical processing models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Priming diminished when an unrelated word intervened between the prime word and target nonword and did so more for the production of low- than for high-contingency spellings. We interpret these results within an interactive model of spelling production that proposes feedback from the graphemic level to both the lexical and assembled spelling processes.

Abstract = {Do word frequency and case mixing affect different processing stages in visual word recognition? Some studies of online reading have suggested that word frequency affects an earlier, perceptual-encoding stage and that case mixing affects a later, central decision stage (e.g., Reingold, Yang, & Rayner, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 36:1677-1683 2010); others have suggested otherwise (e.g., Allen, Smith, Lien, Grabbe, & Murphy, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance 31:713–721 2005; Besner & McCann, 1987). To determine the locus of the word frequency and case-mixing effects, we manipulated word frequency (high vs. low) and case type (consistent lower case vs. mixing case) in a lexical-decision paradigm. We measured two event-related-potential components: the N170 (an early peak occurring 140–240 ms after stimulus onset, related to structural encoding) and the P3 (a late peak occurring 400–600 ms after stimulus onset, related to stimulus categorization). The critical finding was that the N170 amplitude was sensitive to case mixing, but the P3 amplitude was sensitive to word frequency and lexicality. These results suggest that case mixing affects an earlier processing stage than does word frequency, at least with respect to lexical-decision processes.

Abstract = {This paper examines evidence for a nonlexical influence on children's repetition of real words. We investigate the extent to which two computational models of auditory repetition can simulate the performance of 68 children aged between 5 and 11 years-old when they are attempting to repeat familiar words. Both computational accounts were derived from Foygel and Dell's (J Mem Lang 43:182-216, 2000) semantic-phonological model of picture-naming. Results showed that a dual-route model in which a lexical and a nonlexical route work together to repeat familiar words (Hanley et al. in Cogn Neuropsychol 21:147-158, 2004) provided an accurate simulation of children's repetition, whereas Foygel and Dell (J Mem Lang 43:182-216, 2000) single lexical-route model under-predicted performance. The only exception was the repetition performance of 5 year-old children, which was over-predicted by the dual-route model. It is argued that at 5 years of age, some children have available both a lexical and a nonlexical repetition route but the output of the two routes does not summate when real words are being repeated. Some young children may lack the attentional skills that would enable them to co-ordinate the activity of the lexical and nonlexical repetition routes.

Abstract = {This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine whether we employ the same normalisation mechanisms when processing words spoken with a regional accent or foreign accent. Our results showed that the Phonological Mapping Negativity (PMN) following the onset of the final word of sentences spoken with an unfamiliar regional accent was greater than for those produced in the listener’s own accent, whilst PMN for foreign accented speech was reduced. Foreign accents also resulted in a reduction in N400 amplitude when compared to both unfamiliar regional accents and the listener’s own accent, with no significant difference found between the N400 of the regional and home accents. These results suggest that regional accent related variations are normalised at the earliest stages of spoken word recognition, requiring less top-down lexical intervention than foreign accents.

Abstract = {Two classes of hand action representations are shown to be activated by listening to the name of a manipulable object (e.g., cellphone). The functional action associated with the proper use of an object is evoked soon after the onset of its name, as indicated by primed execution of that action. Priming is sustained throughout the duration of the word's enunciation. Volumetric actions (those used to simply lift an object) show a negative priming effect at the onset of a word, followed by a short-lived positive priming effect. This time-course pattern is explained by a dual-process mechanism involving frontal and parietal lobes for resolving conflict between candidate motor responses. Both types of action representations are proposed to be part of the conceptual knowledge recruited when the name of a manipulable object is encountered, although functional actions play a more central role in the representation of lexical concepts.

Abstract = {The objective of our study is to introduce a fully automated, computational linguistic technique to quantify semantic relations between words generated on a standard semantic verbal fluency test and to determine its cognitive and clinical correlates. Cognitive differences between patients with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment are evident in their performance on the semantic verbal fluency test. In addition to the semantic verbal fluency test score, several other performance characteristics sensitive to disease status and predictive of future cognitive decline have been defined in terms of words generated from semantically related categories (clustering) and shifting between categories (switching). However, the traditional assessment of clustering and switching has been performed manually in a qualitative fashion resulting in subjective scoring with limited reproducibility and scalability. Our approach uses word definitions and hierarchical relations between the words in WordNet®, a large electronic lexical database, to quantify the degree of semantic similarity and relatedness between words. We investigated the novel semantic fluency indices of mean cumulative similarity and relatedness between all pairs of words regardless of their order, and mean sequential similarity and relatedness between pairs of adjacent words in a sample of patients with clinically diagnosed probable (n = 55) or possible (n = 27) Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment (n = 31). The semantic fluency indices differed significantly between the diagnostic groups, and were strongly associated with neuropsychological tests of executive function, as well as the rate of global cognitive decline. Our results suggest that word meanings and relations between words shared across individuals and computationally modeled via WordNet and large text corpora provide the necessary context to account for the variability in language-based behavior and relate it to cognitive dysfunction observed in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract = {This study evaluates spelling errors in the three subtypes of primary progressive aphasia (PPA): agrammatic (PPA-G), logopenic (PPA-L), and semantic (PPA-S). Forty-one PPA patients and 36 age-matched healthy controls were administered a test of spelling. The total number of errors and types of errors in spelling to dictation of regular words, exception words and nonwords, were recorded. Error types were classified based on phonetic plausibility. In the first analysis, scores were evaluated by clinical diagnosis. Errors in spelling exception words and phonetically plausible errors were seen in PPA-S. Conversely, PPA-G was associated with errors in nonword spelling and phonetically implausible errors. In the next analysis, spelling scores were correlated to other neuropsychological language test scores. Significant correlations were found between exception word spelling and measures of naming and single word comprehension. Nonword spelling correlated with tests of grammar and repetition. Global language measures did not correlate significantly with spelling scores, however. Cortical thickness analysis based on MRI showed that atrophy in several language regions of interest were correlated with spelling errors. Atrophy in the left supramarginal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars orbitalis correlated with errors in nonword spelling, while thinning in the left temporal pole and fusiform gyrus correlated with errors in exception word spelling. Additionally, phonetically implausible errors in regular word spelling correlated with thinning in the left IFG pars triangularis and pars opercularis. Together, these findings suggest two independent systems for spelling to dictation, one phonetic (phoneme to grapheme conversion), and one lexical (whole word retrieval).

Abstract = {It has repeatedly been demonstrated that automatic speech recognition can benefit from syntactic information. However, virtually all syntactic language models for large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition are based on statistical parsers. In this paper, we investigate the use of a formal grammar as a source of syntactic information. We describe a novel approach to integrating formal grammars into speech recognition and evaluate it in a series of experiments. For a German broadcast news transcription task, the approach was found to reduce the word error rate by 9.7% (relative) compared to a competitive baseline speech recognizer. We provide an extensive discussion on various aspects of the approach, including the contribution of different kinds of information, the development of a precise formal grammar and the acquisition of lexical information.

Abstract = {Several theories, such as the post-lexical processing theory and prelexical processing theory, have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of N400. However, there were certain deficits in these theories and in the current paradigm of priming study. Therefore, a new approach and new theories to investigate N400 effects are required. Verification model and interactive activation models were employed in this study to address these problems. The objective was to ascertain which of these theories provides a much better explanation for the mechanisms of N400. The interaction study approach was adopted. This study adopted a delayed character-matching task to investigate how semantic priming, frequency, and blurredness interact on the N400 components of the Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), which were recorded while participants performed the task. Three Chinese characters were presented in succession in each trial,representing the prime, the target, and the probe stimuli. The prime and the probe were intact characters,whereas the target was blurred one. The materials and procedures in the two experiments were the same, except for the blur redness level of the targets: The targets were slightly blurred in Experiment 1 and were more blurred in Experiment 2. The priming and frequency were manipulated in each experiment with four treatment conditions, namely, primed high frequency, primed low frequency, unprimed high frequency, and unprimed low frequency conditions. Blureedness was manipulated across experiments. The subjects' task was to press one keyboard if the target and the probe were the same character, and to press another other wise. The results of Experiment 1 showed larger N400 amplitudes in unprimed condition than in primed condition for low-frequency target characters, but not for high-frequency target characters. By contrast,Experiment 2 showed N400 priming effects, but no N400 frequency effects. Combining the date from the two experiments, both a three-way interaction among the blur redness, frequency, and priming, and an interaction between blur redness and frequency in unprimed condition were found. An interaction between blur redness and priming under high frequency was observed, whereas interaction between blur redness and priming underflow-frequency condition did not occur. These interactions are interpreted to indicate that frequency, blur redness,and priming are involved in the same stage of lexical processing. In conclusion, the results of the present study are partly expected from the lexical verification explanation constructed based on the verification model, completely expected from the interactive activation model, but completely unexpected from the post lexical theory.

Abstract = {A related word prime has been found to interfere with picture naming after unrelated intervening trials (word-to-picture interference). Recently, Stroop-type picture–word interference effects have been interpreted in terms of a postlexical response exclusion process rather than a competitive lexical selection process. An experiment is reported that examines whether word-to-picture effects could reflect response exclusion mechanisms and, more generally, strategic processing of the word prime. Forty-eight volunteer university students named aloud sequences of semantically related (and unrelated) word primes and picture targets, separated by two unrelated filler stimuli. On half of the trials, participants were asked to count backwards in threes from a random number presented immediately after naming the prime word. They were also given a surprise recall test at the end of the naming block. Results for naming times and errors indicated a main effect of relatedness; semantic interference effects were not dependent on the unfilled gap following the word prime trial and were also not tied to episodic recall of prime words. The data indicate that slowed picture naming times are more likely to emerge from processes intrinsic to word prime naming rather than controlled processing and do not readily fit the postlexical response exclusion account. The results are considered in relation to two recent accounts of interference over unrelated trials, which refer to some form of competition at, or prior to, lexical access.

Abstract = {This article reports on the design and use of a profiler for lexical sophistication (i.e., use of advanced vocabulary), which was created to assess the lexical richness of intermediate and advanced Swedish second language (L2) learners' French and Italian. It discusses how teachers' judgments (TJs) of word difficulty can contribute to the methodology for lexical profiling and compares two methods, one purely frequency based and one modified on the basis of TJs of word difficulty. It has been suggested elsewhere that factors other than frequency play an important role in vocabulary acquisition. Here it is argued that cognates and thematic vocabulary related to teaching materials, although infrequent in target language (TL) corpora, should not necessarily be considered advanced and that analyses of learners' lexical sophistication would benefit from integrating these aspects. In this study, the frequency-based method normally used in lexical profiling was modified by recategorizing some low-frequency words considered easy by many teachers. On the basis of the TJs, a basic vocabulary, which consisted mainly of high-frequency words but also of cognates and thematic words, was defined, which was based on the fact that teachers judged certain low-frequency cognates and thematic words as relatively easy. Using the modified method, learners' lexical profiles were found to be more homogeneous within groups of learners at specific proficiency levels. The superiority of the new method over the purely frequency-based one was shown when comparing effect sizes. It is argued that this method gives a more correct picture of advanced L2 lexical profiles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This is the first study to report differences between Japanese children with and without dyslexia in the way string-length and lexicality effects are manifested when reading Japanese kana. These children were asked to read kana words and non-words consisting of either two or five kana characters. The results showed that the error rates of the normal Preschoolers and Primary-School children with dyslexia were higher than those of the normal Primary-School children. Further, the reading latencies of the normal Preschoolers, First-graders and dyslexics were significantly longer than those of the normal Second, Third and Fifth/Sixth graders. Moreover, reading latencies became shorter as the age of the participants increased. Both normal and dyslexic children showed significant effects of length and lexicality on reading latencies. However, the interaction between the length and lexicality was only seen in normal children from the Second-grade onwards. These results suggest that (1) normal First-graders reach a ceiling in terms of reading accuracy and that (2) as Japanese normal children become older, they become better at lexical reading processes, which leads to fluent kana reading, but that (3) the dyslexics, even at Fifth/Sixth grades, have not developed sufficient lexical reading processes.

Psycholinguistic models describe in which format lexical knowledge is stored and how it is accessed when needed for language use. The present article summarizes key findings in spoken-word recognition by humans and describes how models of spoken-word recognition account for them. Although current models of spoken-word recognition differ considerably in the details of implementation, there is general consensus among them on at least three aspects: multiple word candidates are activated in parallel as a word is being heard, activation of word candidates varies with the degree of match between the speech signal and stored lexical representations, and activated candidate words compete for recognition. No consensus has been reached on other aspects such as the flow of information between different processing levels, and the format of stored prelexical and lexical representations.

Abstract = {In lexical decision, to date few studies in English have found a reliable pseudohomophone priming advantage with orthographically similar primes (the klip–plip effect; Frost, Ahissar, Gotesman, & Tayeb, 2003; see Rastle & Brysbaert, 2006, for a review). On the basis of the Bayseian reader model of lexical decision (Norris, 2006, 2009), we hypothesized that this was because in previous studies, lexical decisions could have been made without finding a match between the input and a unique lexical representation. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that words from dense neighborhoods showed neither an orthographic form priming effect nor a pseudohomophone priming advantage; in contrast, with words from a sparse lexical neighborhood, a sizeable orthographic form priming effect was found, and a robust pseudohomophone priming advantage, which was not limited to the overlap of onset phoneme, was also observed. Identity primes produced greater facilitation than pseudohomophone primes. We consider the implication of these findings for the role of assembled phonology in lexical access.

Abstract = {We report 3 experiments that examined whether presentation of a spoken word creates an attentional bottleneck associated with lexical processing in the absence of a response to that word. A spoken word and a visual stimulus were presented in quick succession, but only the visual stimulus demanded a response. Response times to the visual stimulus increased as the lag between it and the spoken word decreased, suggesting a bottleneck in processing. This effect was modulated by the uniqueness point of the spoken word; bottleneck effects were strongest when the spoken word had a late uniqueness point (Experiment 1). The effect was also modulated by the nature of the second task, with the effect stronger when the visual stimulus was a word rather than a shape (Experiment 2) or face (Experiment 3). Word processing appears to create a transient lexical bottleneck that is driven by the magnitude of lexical activity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Picture–word interference is a widely employed paradigm to investigate lexical access in word production: Speakers name pictures while trying to ignore superimposed distractor words. The distractor can be congruent to the picture (pictured cat, word cat), categorically related (pictured cat, word dog), or unrelated (pictured cat, word pen). Categorically related distractors slow down picture naming relative to unrelated distractors, the so-called semantic interference. Categorically related distractors slow down picture naming relative to congruent distractors, analogous to findings in the colour–word Stroop task. The locus of semantic interference and Stroop-like effects in naming performance has recently become a topic of debate. Whereas some researchers argue for a pre-lexical locus of semantic interference and a lexical locus of Stroop-like effects, others localise both effects at the lexical selection stage. We investigated the time course of semantic and Stroop-like interference effects in overt picture naming by means of event-related potentials (ERP) and time–frequency analyses. Moreover, we employed cluster-based permutation for statistical analyses. Naming latencies showed semantic and Stroop-like interference effects. The ERP waveforms for congruent stimuli started diverging statistically from categorically related stimuli around 250ms. Deflections for the categorically related condition were more negative-going than for the congruent condition (the Stroop-like effect). The time–frequency analysis revealed a power increase in the beta band (12–30 Hz) for categorically related relative to unrelated stimuli roughly between 250 and 370ms (the semantic effect). The common time window of these effects suggests that both semantic interference and Stroop-like effects emerged during lexical selection.

Abstract = {Although the sensitivity of the N400 to semantic processing is well established, late positive ERP components are also elicited during sentence comprehension. We suggest that there are multiple such components differing in scalp topography, and that a larger frontal positivity often follows the larger N400 elicited by congruent but unexpected sentence endings as compared to predictable endings. We evaluated the lexical versus conceptual specificity of this post-N400-positivity. High- and low-constraint sentences were completed by the words most preferred by a normative group (best completions), by words that were nearly synonymous to those best completions, and by other congruent words that were semantically dissimilar to the best completions. The N400 was sensitive to both the predictability (cloze probability) of the words and their semantic similarity to the best completion, consistent with a sensitivity to conceptual expectations that could be fulfilled by alternate words. In contrast, an anterior positivity was elicited by all final words that were not highly predictable, independent of whether they were semantically similar or dissimilar to the most preferred word, indicating a sensitivity to specific lexical expectations.

Abstract = {Recent literature has sought to understand the presence of epenthetic vowels after the productions of postvocalic word-final consonants by second language (L2) learners whose first languages (L1s) restrict the presence of obstruents in coda position. Previous models include those in which epenthesis is seen as a strategy to mitigate the effects of coda licensing restrictions in the L1; others see epenthesis as a result of misperception of consonant releases in the L2 as indicating the presence of an additional syllable nucleus. The current study examines segmental identification and syllable counting in inexperienced Korean learners of English as a foreign language. Across stimuli, two effects were found. Increased perceptual epenthesis correlated with increased identification of a segment as voiceless, indicating a joint perception of voicelessness and an epenthetic vowel. Also, rate of epenthesis increased with accuracy of detecting sibilants and coronal segments, sounds characterized by salient consonant noise. Taken together, these results indicate a perceptual mechanism that evaluates segmental content and prosodic structure from an integrated percept. Analyses across individual listeners do not support a model in which perceptual epenthesis is a strategy to increase segmental accuracy; rather, they support models in which both syllable counting and segmental identification are skills that are reflections of increased proficiency in the L2. These results are discussed with respect to models of L2 phonology that rely on the robust encoding of lexical items. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The current study was designed to trace changes in the relationship between non-word reading and irregular word reading on the one hand, and between phonological awareness and non-word reading on the other, through a follow-up study of a group of individuals with Down syndrome. Twelve individuals with Down syndrome, whose data were originally reported in Roch and Jarrold (2008), were seen four years later, and were given the same tasks as in the previous study evaluating phonological awareness, non-word reading and irregular word reading. After four years, an improvement was observed in all the skills of interest. Furthermore, the pattern of relationships among the three skills was observed to change considerably across the four year period. At the first time point, a weak association between non-word and irregular word reading was found, but there was a strong association between these two measures at the second time point. In contrast, a strong relationship was found at Time 1 between non-word reading and phonological awareness, which became weaker at Time 2. Longitudinal associations between the three skills were also examined in order to explain this changing pattern of associations. The results indicated that the ability to decode non-words plays a marginal role on later irregular word reading. In contrast, irregular word reading is a longitudinal predictor of later non-word reading. Phonological awareness was not longitudinally related to non-word reading. The results indicate that developing word knowledge can facilitate later non-word reading in Down syndrome, perhaps by a process of reading by visual analogy to known lexical items.

Abstract = {When identifying spoken words, older listeners may have difficulty resolving lexical competition or may place a greater weight on factors like lexical frequency. To obtain information about age differences in the time course of spoken word recognition, young and older adults' eye movements were monitored as they followed spoken instructions to click on objects displayed on a computer screen. Older listeners were more likely than younger listeners to fixate high-frequency displayed phonological competitors. However, degradation of auditory quality in younger listeners does not reproduce this result. These data are most consistent with an increased role for lexical frequency with age.

Abstract = {The transformation of an abstract concept into an articulated word is achieved through a series of encoding processes, which time course has been repeatedly investigated in the psycholinguistic and neuroimaging literature on single word production. The estimates of the time course issued from previous investigations represent the timing of process duration for mean processing speed: as production speed varies significantly across speakers, a crucial question is how the timing of encoding processing varies with speed. Here we investigated whether between-subjects variability in the speed of speech production is distributed along all encoding processes or if it is accounted for by a specific processing stage. We analysed event-related electroencephalographical (ERP) correlates during overt picture naming in 45 subjects divided into three speed subgroups according to their production latencies. Production speed modulated waveform amplitudes in the time window ranging from about 200 to 350 ms after picture presentation and the duration of a stable electrophysiological spatial configuration in the same time period. The remaining time windows from picture onset to 200 ms before articulation were unaffected by speed. By contrast, the manipulation of a psycholinguistic variable, word age-of-acquisition, modulated ERPs in all speed subgroups in a different and later time period, starting at around 400 ms after picture presentation, associated with phonological encoding processes. These results indicate that the between-subject variability in the speed of single word production is principally accounted for by the timing of a stable electrophysiological activity in the 200–350 ms time period, presumably associated with lexical selection.

Abstract = {In three phoneme goodness rating experiments, listeners heard phonetic tokens varying along a continuum centered on /s/, occurring finally in isolated word or non-word tokens. An effect of spelling appeared in Experiment 1: native English-speakers’ goodness ratings for the best /s/ tokens were significantly higher in words spelled with S (e.g., bless) than in words spelled with C (e.g., voice). Since the tokens were in fact identical in each word, this effect indicates less than optimal evaluation performance. No spelling effect appeared when non-native speakers rated the same materials in Experiment 2, indicating that the observed difference could not be due to acoustic characteristics of the S- versus C-words. In Experiment 3, native English-speakers’ ratings for /s/ did not differ in non-words rhyming with words consistently spelled with S (e.g., pless) or with words consistently spelled with C (e.g., floice); i.e., no effects of lexical rhyme analogs appeared. It is concluded that the findings are better explained in terms of phonemic decisions drawing upon lexical information where convenient than by obligatory influence of lexical knowledge upon pre-lexical processing.

Abstract = {The current study explored how listeners map the variable acoustic input onto a common sound structure representation while being able to retain phonetic detail to distinguish among the identity of talkers. An adaptation paradigm was utilised to examine areas that showed an equal neural response (equal release from adaptation) to phonetic change when spoken by the same speaker and when spoken by two different speakers, and insensitivity (failure to show release from adaptation) when the same phonetic input was spoken by a different speaker. Neural areas that showed speaker invariance were located in the anterior portion of the middle superior temporal gyrus bilaterally. These findings provide support for the view that speaker normalisation processes allow for the translation of a variable speech input to a common abstract sound structure. That this process appears to occur early in the processing stream, recruiting temporal structures, suggests that this mapping takes place prelexically, before sound structure input is mapped onto lexical representations.

Abstract = {Recent neurobiological studies revealed evidence for lexical representations that are not specified for the coronal place of articulation (PLACE; Friedrich, Eulitz, & Lahiri, 2006; Friedrich, Lahiri, & Eulitz, 2008). Here we tested when these types of underspecified representations influence neuronal speech recognition. In a unimodal auditory-auditory word fragment priming experiment target words either had initial coronal PLACE (e.g., tiger) or had initial noncoronal PLACE (e.g., pony). Prime-target pairs were either identical (e.g., ti-tiger, po-pony), differed in initial PLACE (e.g., pi-tiger, to-pony), or were unrelated. Event-related Potentials for identical and related targets started to differ from unrelated targets at 100 ms, indicating early perceptual processing. Different effects for coronal vs. noncoronal variation were observed starting at 200 ms. Results are related to recent neurocognitive research on compensation for assimilation of PLACE (e.g., rainbow realised as raimbow). A time line of processing PLACE variation at multiple stages is proposed and parallel processing of specified and underspecified representations at the lexical level is discussed.

Then, we report a series of experiments that have investigated the influence of sensitivity to graphotactic regularities on the learning of word-specific spelling. These experiments suggest that the concordance between the orthographic structure of words and graphotactic regularities would cause (in part) the difficulties of acquisition of lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine the relations between speech sound accuracy, vocabulary, and phonological awareness, and (2) to examine the effect of word properties of neighborhood density and phonotactic probability on word learning within a storybook context, for children with and without speech sound inaccuracies. Fifty K–1 children (aged 5–6 years; 25 with, 25 without speech sound inaccuracies) completed inclusionary measures of oral language, speech sound accuracy, hearing screening, oral–motor screening, and nonverbal intelligence. Participants completed study-specific measures of standardized receptive and expressive vocabulary, stimuli-specific vocabulary knowledge, and phonological awareness. Twice weekly, for 30 minutes, an 11-week storybook-based intervention took place, targeting word learning, with words selected based on density and probability. Storybooks were researcher generated to intentionally manipulate the word properties of the stimuli words. Each storybook contained two stimuli words, four exposures per word per reading. Results indicated that both speech sound accuracy and vocabulary predicted unique variance in phonological awareness in children with speech sound inaccuracies. No statistically significant differences in the absolute number of words children learned emerged. Group differences were noted in emerging word knowledge with typically developing children outperforming children with speech sound inaccuracies. Differences were noted in the types of words that children learned. Results suggest that children with speech sound inaccuracies may be at risk for later reading difficulties. Speech language pathologists need to be targeting words that promote change within a child’s phonological system (sublexical) and his/her lexical system.

Abstract = {Empirical work and models of visual word recognition have traditionally focused on group-level performance. Despite the emphasis on the prototypical reader, there is clear evidence that variation in reading skill modulates word recognition performance. In the present study, we examined differences among individuals who contributed to the English Lexicon Project (http://elexicon.wustl.edu), an online behavioral database containing nearly 4 million word recognition (speeded pronunciation and lexical decision) trials from over 1,200 participants. We observed considerable within- and between-session reliability across distinct sets of items, in terms of overall mean response time (RT), RT distributional characteristics, diffusion model parameters (Ratcliff, Gomez, & McKoon, 2004), and sensitivity to underlying lexical dimensions. This indicates reliably detectable individual differences in word recognition performance. In addition, higher vocabulary knowledge was associated with faster, more accurate word recognition performance, attenuated sensitivity to stimuli characteristics, and more efficient accumulation of information. Finally, in contrast to suggestions in the literature, we did not find evidence that individuals were trading-off their utilization of lexical and nonlexical information.

We have parsed the British National Corpus and constructed a database of lexical dependencies. Such a large-scale approach allows for a detailed investigation of patterns and constructions associated with individual lexical items found in argument positions. We then address the methodological problems of such an approach. precision errors (unwanted instances) and recall errors (missed instances) and offer a detailed evaluation. We investigate the interaction between syntax and lexis in verb-subject and verb-object structures as well as the active-passive alternation. We show that our approach provides relatively clean data and allows for a corpus-driven investigation of rare collocations.

Abstract = {In this paper, we present how creation and dynamic synthesis of linguistic resources of Greek Sign Language (GSL) may serve to support development and provide content to an educational multitask platform for the teaching of GSL in early elementary school classes. The presented system utilizes standard virtual character (VC) animation technologies for the synthesis of sign sequences/streams, exploiting digital linguistic resources of both lexicon and grammar of GSL. Input to the system is written Greek text, which is transformed into GSL and animated on screen. To achieve this, a syntactic parser decodes the structural patterns of written Greek and matches them into equivalent patterns of GSL, which are then signed by a VC. The adopted notation system for the representation of GSL phonology incorporated in the system's lexical knowledge database, is Hamburg Notation System (HamNoSys). For the implementation of the virtual signer tool, the definition of the VC follows the h-anim standard and is implemented in a web browser using a standard VRML plug-in.},

Abstract = {A method used widely to study the first 250 ms of visual word recognition is masked priming: These studies have yielded a rich set of data concerning the processes involved in recognizing letters and words. In these studies, there is an implicit assumption that the early processes in word recognition tapped by masked priming are automatic, and masked priming effects should therefore be invariant across tasks. Contrary to this assumption, masked priming effects are modulated by the task goal: For example, only word targets show priming in the lexical decision task, but both words and non-words do in the same-different task; semantic priming effects are generally weak in the lexical decision task but are robust in the semantic categorization task. We explain how such task dependence arises within the Bayesian Reader account of masked priming (Norris and Kinoshita, 2008), and how the task dissociations can be used to understand the early processes in lexical access.

Abstract = {Skilled reading is a remarkable achievement for humans (Huey, 1908). The process of reading is extremely complex with many levels of representation; reading proceeds from 'low' levels to 'high' levels of representation. That is, first visual information is received through the eyes and the orthographic, phonological, and morphological properties (generally considered sublexical properties) of the word are analyzed. Finally the semantic and syntactic representations (generally considered superlexical) are accessed and integrated into the meaning of the sentence. Furthermore, the current sentence must be integrated with the discourse level representation of the entire text context (for a discussion of these various levels of representation, see Rayner & Pollatsek, 1989; Rayner et al., 2012). In this chapter, our goal is to provide an overview of research utilizing eye movement data to examine the relationship between word recognition and the oculomotor system in reading with our primary focus on recent models of eye movement control (discussed at the end of the chapter) that represent the identification of different words in the text in terms of either serial or parallel lexical processing.

Abstract = {When we read, the usual goal is to generate meaning from the words on a page. Reading connected text involves a number of component processes, one of which is assumed to be visual word recognition. That is, recognition of isolated words is assumed to be a component skill of reading. As such, one might assume that activation of word meaning would be an integral part of all models of the visual word recognition process. In fact, the influence of meaning or semantic information in word recognition has been controversial. This chapter has two aims. The first is to demonstrate that meaning influences visual word recognition. The second is to provide a synthesis of the ways in which meaning influences the process of word recognition in order that we might have a better understanding of the dimensions of meaning that are accessed in lexical processing.

Abstract = {In this chapter, we review a relatively recent approach to studying lexical processing, which involves developing large databases that are made available for researchers to study across three distinct domains; isolated visual word recognition, semantic priming, and recognition memory. One of the goals of this research endeavor is to help define the common set of principles that researchers can rely upon in better understanding how lexical processing influences critical aspects of cognition. This megastudy approach contrasts with the more traditional approach of factorial experiments targeting specific variables within small-scale studies. We will ultimately argue that progress in this field is going to depend on a judicious combination of targeted factorial studies and large scale databases.

Abstract = {Conventionality is a pragmatic principle of lexical acquisition which makes the adequacy of words to the context possible. The aim of this study was to compare dichotomic and continuous analysis in the classification of this pragmatic principle. The data were obtained by an actions naming task composed of 17 brief videos, applied to 37 children aged between 2:0 and 3:0 and 43 children aged between 3:1 and 4:5. Two analyses were compared: (1) dichotomic—verbs classified as non conventional or conventional; and (2) continuous, scores between 1 and 5, obtained using a Likert scale. The results showed that the two kinds of analysis distinguish the age groups, although the continuous analysis presents advantages, revealing more details about the verbs lexical development.

Abstract = {Lexical-semantic variables (such as word frequency, imageability and age of acquisition) have been studied extensively in neuropsychology to address the structure of the word production system. The evidence available on this issue is still rather controversial, mainly because of the very complex interrelations between lexical-semantic variables. Moreover, it is not clear whether the results obtained in Indo-European languages also hold in languages with a completely different structure and script, such as Chinese. The objective of the present study is to investigate this specific issue by studying the effect of word frequency, imageability, age of acquisition, visual complexity of the stimuli to be named, grammatical class and morphological structure in word and picture naming in Chinese. The effect of these variables on naming and reading accuracy of healthy and brain damaged individuals is evaluated using mixed-effect models, a statistical technique that allows to model both fixed and random effects; this feature substantially enhances the statistical power of the technique, so that several variables – and their complex interrelations – can be handled effectively in a unique analysis. We found that grammatical class interacts consistently across tasks with morphological structure: all participants, both healthy and brain-damaged, found simple nouns significantly easier to read and name than complex nouns, whereas simple and complex verbs were of comparable difficulty. We also found that imageability was a strong predictor in picture naming, but not in word naming, whereas the contrary held true for age of acquisition. These results are taken to indicate the existence of a morphological level of processing in the Chinese word production system, and that reading aloud may occur along a non-semantic route (either lexical or sub-lexical) in this language.

Abstract = {The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) approach has a long track record in crosslinguistic lexical semantics (Wierzbicka 1992, 1996, 1999; Goddard 1998, 2006, 2008, 2011; Harkins and Wierzbicka 2001; Goddard and Wierzbicka 2002; Peeters 2006; Gladkova 2010; Ye 2007a, 2007b, 2010; Bromhead 2009, 2011; Wong 2005, 2010; and other works). It is therefore not surprising that it has a clear theoretical position on key issues in lexical semantic typology and a well-developed set of analytical techniques. From a theoretical point of view, the overriding issue concerns the tertium comparationis. What are the optimal concepts and categories to support the systematic investigation of lexicons and lexicological phenomena across the world's languages? To this question, the NSM approach offers the following answer: the necessary concepts can — and must — be based on the shared lexical-conceptual core of all languages, which NSM researchers claim to have discovered over the course of a thirty-five year program of empirical crosslinguistic semantics. This shared lexical-conceptual core is the minilanguage of semantic primes and their associated grammar. In addition, over the past 10 or so years, NSM researchers have developed certain original analytical constructs which promise to enhance the power and systematicity of the approach: in particular, the notions of semantic molecules and semantic templates. This paper sets out to explain and illustrate these notions, to report some key analytical findings (updated, in many cases, from previously published accounts), and to extrapolate their implications for the further development of lexical typology.

Abstract = {Preschoolers participated in a modified version of the disambiguation task, designed to test whether the pragmatic environment generated by a reliable or unreliable speaker affected how children interpreted novel labels. Two objects were visible to children, while a third was only visible to the speaker (a fact known by the child). Manipulating whether a novel object was visible to both interlocutors or hidden from the child tested the child’s understanding of pragmatic expectations of interlocutor competence. When interacting with a speaker with a history of accurately labeling familiar objects, children responded appropriately in both cases. When interacting with a speaker who previously generated inaccurate labels for familiar objects, children’s behavior and eye-movements reflected their belief that the speaker was not a competent communicator. These data support the hypothesis that children consider the pragmatic environment constructed by an interlocutor when that speaker asks them to make a lexical inference.

Abstract = {People with agrammatic aphasia often experience greater difficulty comprehending passive compared to active sentences. The Trace Deletion Hypothesis (TDH; Grodzinsky, 2000) proposes that aphasic individuals cannot generate accurate syntactic representations of passive sentences and, hence, use an agent-first processing strategy which leads to at-chance performance. We tested this claim using the eye tracking-while-listening paradigm in order to reveal online processing routines. Ten agrammatic aphasic participants and 10 age-matched controls listened to passive and active sentences and performed a sentence-picture matching task (i.e., selecting between two pictures with reversed thematic roles), while their eye movements were monitored. Control participants’ performance was at ceiling, whereas accuracy for the aphasic participants was above chance for active sentences and at chance for passive sentences. Further, for the control participants, the eye movement data showed an initial agent-first processing bias, followed by fixation on the correct picture in the vicinity of the verb in both active and passive sentences. However, the aphasic participants showed no evidence of agent-first processing, counter the predictions of the TDH. In addition, in active sentences, they reliably fixated the correct picture only at sentence offset, reflecting slowed processing. During passive sentence processing, fixations were at chance throughout the sentence, but different patterns were noted for correct and incorrect trials. These results are consistent with the proposal that agrammatic sentence comprehension failure involves lexical processing and/or lexical integration deficits.

Abstract = {The question we investigate in this chapter is this: Can children learn any aspects of language from electronic media? We use the term electronic media here to refer to television and video content that is viewed on a screen. Nearly 90% of toddlers and preschoolers watch television or video programs each day, with over 40% viewing two or more hours a day (Rideout & Hamel, 2006). Therefore, what children can learn from this prevalent pastime is a very important question. Contrary to popular belief, young children are frequently active participants as they watch television. Children call attention to, or label objects on the screen (Lemish & Rice, 1986), laugh at the appropriate points, and repeat parts of the ongoing dialogue (Singer & Singer, 1998). Children also rarely watch TV alone, which provides them with an opportunity to ask questions of their co-viewer about what is on the screen (Lemish & Rice, 1986; Zimmerman, Christakis, & Meltzoff, 2007). Thus, the possibility remains that children can acquire at least some aspects of language through watching television and videos; the purpose of our chapter is to survey the available evidence to see what aspects of language children actually do learn. We will first examine the influences of electronic media on children's grammatical development before addressing the effects on lexical development.

Abstract = {Music listeners have difficulty correctly understanding and remembering song lyrics. However, results from the present study support the hypothesis that young adults can learn African-American English (AAE) vocabulary from listening to hip-hop music. Non-African-American participants first gave free-response definitions to AAE vocabulary items, after which they answered demographic questions as well as questions addressing their social networks, their musical preferences, and their knowledge of popular culture. Results from the survey show a positive association between the number of hip-hop artists listened to and AAE comprehension vocabulary scores. Additionally, participants were more likely to know an AAE vocabulary item if the hip-hop artists they listen to use the word in their song lyrics. Together, these results suggest that young adults can acquire vocabulary through exposure to hip-hop music, a finding relevant for research on vocabulary acquisition, the construction of adolescent and adult identities, and the adoption of lexical innovations.

Abstract = {Grammar is frequently considered to be a strength in the cognitive profile of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, few studies have investigated how abstract (i.e. distinct from specific lexical items) is the grammatical knowledge of individuals with ASD. In this study, we examine the extent to which children with ASD have abstracted the transitive (SVO) frame in English. Participants in a longitudinal study of language acquisition in children with autism (17 children with ASD averaging 41 months of age, 18 TD children averaging 28 months of age) were taught two novel verbs in transitive sentences and asked (via intermodal preferential looking) whether these verbs mapped onto novel causative vs. noncausative actions. Both groups consistently mapped the verbs onto the causative actions (i.e. they engaged in syntactic bootstrapping). Moreover, the children with ASD’s performance on this task was significantly and independently predicted by both vocabulary and sentence-processing measures obtained 8 months earlier. We conclude that many children with ASD are able to generalize grammatical patterns, and this ability may derive from earlier lexical and grammatical knowledge.

Abstract = {Abstract Previous work examining prosodic cues in online spoken-word recognition has focused primarily on local cues to word identity. However, recent studies have suggested that utterance-level prosodic patterns can also influence the interpretation of subsequent sequences of lexically ambiguous syllables (Dilley, Mattys, & Vinke, Journal of Memory and Language, 63:274–294, 2010; Dilley & McAuley, Journal of Memory and Language, 59:294–311, 2008). To test the hypothesis that these distal prosody effects are based on expectations about the organization of upcoming material, we conducted a visual-world experiment. We examined fixations to competing alternatives such as pan and panda upon hearing the target word panda in utterances in which the acoustic properties of the preceding sentence material had been manipulated. The proportions of fixations to the monosyllabic competitor were higher beginning 200 ms after target word onset when the preceding prosody supported a prosodic constituent boundary following pan-, rather than following panda. These findings support the hypothesis that expectations based on perceived prosodic patterns in the distal context influence lexical segmentation and word recognition (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We investigated the role of lexical syntactic information such as grammatical gender and category in spoken word retrieval processes by using a blocking paradigm in picture and written word naming experiments. In Experiments 1, 3, and 4, we found that the naming of target words (nouns) from pictures or written words was faster when these target words were named within a list where only words from the same grammatical category had to be produced (homogeneous category list: all nouns) than when they had to be produced within a list comprising also words from another grammatical category (heterogeneous category list: nouns and verbs). On the other hand, we detected no significant facilitation effect when the target words had to be named within a homogeneous gender list (all masculine nouns) compared to a heterogeneous gender list (both masculine and feminine nouns). In Experiment 2, using the same blocking paradigm by manipulating the semantic category of the items, we found that naming latencies were significantly slower in the semantic category homogeneous in comparison with the semantic category heterogeneous condition. Thus semantic category homogeneity caused an interference, not a facilitation effect like grammatical category homogeneity. Finally, in Experiment 5, nouns in the heterogeneous category condition had to be named just after a verb (category-switching position) or a noun (same-category position). We found a facilitation effect of category homogeneity but no significant effect of position, which showed that the effect of category homogeneity found in Experiments 1, 3, and 4 was not due to a cost of switching between grammatical categories in the heterogeneous grammatical category list. These findings supported the hypothesis that grammatical category information impacts word retrieval processes in speech production, even when words are to be produced in isolation. They are discussed within the context of extant theories of lexical production. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Are words stored as morphologically structured representations? If so, when during word recognition are morphological pieces accessed? Recent masked priming studies support models that assume early decomposition of (potentially) morphologically complex words. The electrophysiological evidence, however, is inconsistent. We combined masked morphological priming with magneto-encephalography (MEG), a technique particularly adept at indexing processes involved in lexical access. The latency of an MEG component peaking, on average, 220 msec post-onset of the target in left occipito-temporal brain regions was found to be sensitive to the morphological prime–target relationship under masked priming conditions in a visual lexical decision task. Shorter latencies for related than unrelated conditions were observed both for semantically transparent (cleaner–CLEAN) and opaque (corner–CORN) prime–target pairs, but not for prime–target pairs with only an orthographic relationship (brothel–BROTH). These effects are likely to reflect a prelexical level of processing where form-based representations of stems and affixes are represented and are in contrast to models positing no morphological structure in lexical representations. Moreover, we present data regarding the transitional probability from stem to affix in a post hoc comparison, which suggests that this factor may modulate early morphological decomposition, particularly for opaque words. The timing of a robust MEG component sensitive to the morphological relatedness of prime–target pairs can be used to further understand the neural substrates and the time course of lexical processing.

Abstract = {The distinction between semantics (linguistically encoded meaning) and pragmatics (inferences about communicative intentions) can often be unclear and counterintuitive. For example, linguistic theories argue that the meaning of some encompasses the meaning of all while the intuition that some implies not all results from an inference. We explored how online interpretation of some evolves using an eye-tracking while listening paradigm. Early eye-movements indicated that while some was initially interpreted as compatible with all, participants began excluding referents compatible with all approximately 800 ms later. These results contrast with recent evidence of immediate inferencing and highlight the presence of bottom-up semantic–pragmatic interactions which necessarily rely on initial access to lexical meanings to trigger inferences.

Abstract = {The authors present a model of lexical proficiency based on lexical indices related to vocabulary size, depth of lexical knowledge, and accessibility to core lexical items. The lexical indices used in this study come from the computational tool Coh-Metrix and include word length scores, lexical diversity values, word frequency counts, hypernymy values, polysemy values, semantic co-referentiality, word meaningfulness, word concreteness, word imagability, and word familiarity. Human raters evaluated a corpus of 240 written texts using a standardized rubric of lexical proficiency. To ensure a variety of text levels, the corpus comprised 60 texts each from beginning, intermediate, and advanced second language (L2) adult English learners. The L2 texts were collected longitudinally from 10 English learners. In addition, 60 texts from native English speakers were collected. The holistic scores from the trained human raters were then correlated to a variety of lexical indices. The researchers found that lexical diversity, word hypernymy values and content word frequency explain 44% of the variance of the human evaluations of lexical proficiency in the examined writing samples. The findings represent an important step in the development of a model of lexical proficiency that incorporates both vocabulary size and depth of lexical knowledge features.

Abstract = {Human speech is composed of two types of information, related to content (lexical information, i.e., 'what' is being said [e.g., words]) and to the speaker (indexical information, i.e., 'who' is talking [e.g., voices]). The extent to which lexical versus indexical information is represented separately or integrally in the brain is unresolved. In the current experiment, we use short-term fMRI adaptation to address this issue. Participants performed a loudness judgment task during which single or multiple sets of words/pseudowords were repeated with single (repeat) or multiple talkers (speaker-change) conditions while BOLD responses were collected. As reflected by adaptation fMRI, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus, a crucial component of the ventral auditory stream performing sound-to-meaning computations ('what' pathway), showed sensitivity to lexical as well as indexical information. Previous studies have suggested that speaker information is abstracted during this stage of auditory word processing. Here, we demonstrate that indexical information is strongly coupled with word information. These findings are consistent with a plethora of behavioral results that have demonstrated that changes to speaker-related information can influence lexical processing.

Abstract = {Four eye movement experiments investigated whether readers use parafoveal input to gain information about the phonological or orthographic forms of consonants, vowels, and tones in word recognition when reading Thai silently. Target words were presented in sentences preceded by parafoveal previews in which consonant, vowel, or tone information was manipulated. Previews of homophonous consonants (Experiment 1) and concordant vowels (Experiment 2) did not substantially facilitate processing of the target word, whereas the identical previews did. Hence, orthography appears to be playing the prominent role in early word recognition for consonants and vowels. Incorrect tone marker previews (Experiment 3) substantially retarded the subsequent processing of the target word, indicating that lexical tone plays an important role in early word recognition. Vowels in VOP (Experiment 4) did not facilitate processing, which points to vowel position being a significant factor. Primarily, orthographic codes of consonants and vowels (HOP) in conjunction with tone information are assembled from parafoveal input and used for early lexical access.

Abstract = {Aims: The goals of the study were (a) to examine the effect of discourse type on lexical diversity by testing whether there are significant differences among language samples elicited using four discourse tasks (procedures, eventcasts, story telling, and recounts); and (b) to assess the extent to which age influences lexical diversity when different types of discourse are elicited. Methods & Procedures: A total of 86 cognitively healthy adults participated in the study and comprised two groups – young adults (20–29 years old) and older adults (70–89 years old). Participants completed the discourse tasks and their language samples were analysed using dedicated software (voc-D) to obtain estimates of their lexical diversity. Outcomes & Results: A mixed 2 × 4 ANOVA was conducted and followed by an investigation of simple main effects. A lexical diversity hierarchy was established that was similar for both age groups. The study also uncovered age-related differences that were evident when the stimuli were verbally presented but were eliminated when the language samples were elicited using pictorial stimuli. Conclusions: Results indicated that lexical diversity is one of the microlinguistic indices that are influenced by discourse type and age, a finding that carries important methodological implications. Future investigations are warranted to explore the patterns of lexical diversity in individuals with neurogenic language disorders and assess the clinical utility of measures of lexical diversity.

Abstract = {Do Slovak–German bilinguals apply native Slovak phonological and lexical knowledge when segmenting German speech? When Slovaks listen to their native language, segmentation is impaired when fixed-stress cues are absent (Hanulíková, McQueen & Mitterer, 2010), and, following the Possible-Word Constraint (PWC; Norris, McQueen, Cutler & Butterfield, 1997), lexical candidates are disfavored if segmentation leads to vowelless residues, unless those residues are existing Slovak words. In the present study, fixed-stress cues on German target words were again absent. Nevertheless, in support of the PWC, both German and Slovak listeners recognized German words (e.g., Rose 'rose') faster in syllable contexts (suckrose) than in single-consonant contexts (krose, trose). But only the Slovak listeners recognized, for example, Rose faster in krose than in trose (k is a Slovak word, t is not). It appears that non-native listeners can suppress native stress segmentation procedures, but that they suffer from prevailing interference from native lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {To investigate whether idiom production was vulnerable to age-related difficulties, we asked 40 younger (ages 18–30) and 40 older healthy adults (ages 60–85) to produce idiomatic expressions in a story-completion task. Younger adults produced significantly more correct idiom responses (73%) than did older adults (60%). When older adults generated partially correct responses, they were less likely than younger participants to eventually produce the complete target idiom (old: 32%; young: 70%); first-word cues after initial failure to retrieve an idiom resulted in more correct idioms for older (24%) than younger (15%) participants. Correlations between age and idiom correctness were positive for the young group and negative for the older group, suggesting mastery of familiar idioms continues into adulthood. Within each group, scores on the Boston Naming Test correlated with performance on the idiom task. Findings for retrieving idiomatic expressions are thus similar to those for retrieving lexical items. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We examine the mechanisms that support interaction between lexical, phonological and phonetic processes during language production. Studies of the phonetics of speech errors have provided evidence that partially activated lexical and phonological representations influence phonetic processing. We examine how these interactive effects are modulated by lexical frequency. Previous research has demonstrated that during lexical access, the processing of high frequency words is facilitated; in contrast, during phonetic encoding, the properties of low frequency words are enhanced. These contrasting effects provide the opportunity to distinguish two theoretical perspectives on how interaction between processing levels can be increased. A theory in which cascading activation is used to increase interaction predicts that the facilitation of high frequency words will enhance their influence on the phonetic properties of speech errors. Alternatively, if interaction is increased by integrating levels of representation, the phonetics of speech errors will reflect the retrieval of enhanced phonetic properties for low frequency words. Utilizing a novel statistical analysis method, we show that in experimentally induced speech errors low lexical frequency targets and outcomes exhibit enhanced phonetic processing. We sketch an interactive model of lexical, phonological and phonetic processing that accounts for the conflicting effects of lexical frequency on lexical access and phonetic processing.

Abstract = {Affective dysfunction is a defining schizotypy feature; yet the majority of studies examining affective dysfunction have largely relied on self-report of trait affect, which reflects only one dimension of emotional experience. Emerging research has explored a second dimension, state affect, using laboratory manipulation, with most finding that schizotypal participants report experiencing less positive/more negative affect than controls. This study expands upon this topic by examining patterns of state affect in psychometrically identified schizotypy through self-report and lexical expression in reaction to emotionally valenced photos. Overall, the schizotypy group reported less positive/more negative affect across affect induction conditions. Both schizotypy and control groups' affect ratings were similar following the unpleasant stimuli; but the schizotypy group's ratings remained significantly less positive/more negative than the control group following the pleasant stimuli. This pattern suggests that the schizotypy group experienced a deficit in emotional reactivity compared to controls in pleasant situations. The schizotypy group also used a higher percentage of negative words and a lower percentage of positive words in vocalized reactions during the pleasant, but not unpleasant, affect induction condition. These results reveal a specific pattern of 'in-the-moment' affective dysfunction unique to pleasant situations that is consistent across both subjective experience and lexical expression.

Abstract = {In 2 separate self-paced reading experiments, Farmer, Christiansen, and Monaghan (2006) found that the degree to which a word's phonology is typical of other words in its lexical category influences online processing of nouns and verbs in predictive contexts. Staub, Grant, Clifton, and Rayner (2009) failed to find an effect of phonological typicality when they combined stimuli from the separate experiments into a single experiment. We replicated Staub et al.'s experiment and found that the combination of stimulus sets affects the predictiveness of the syntactic context; this reduces the phonological typicality effect as the experiment proceeds, although the phonological typicality effect was still evident early in the experiment. Although an ambiguous context may diminish sensitivity to the probabilistic relationship between the sound of a word and its lexical category, phonological typicality does influence online sentence processing during normal reading when the syntactic context is predictive of the lexical category of upcoming words.

Abstract = {Background: Our main purpose was to compare the lexical development of Spanish children with Down syndrome (DS) and children with typical development (TD) to investigate the relationship between cognitive and vocabulary development in comprehension and oral and gestural production. Method: Participants were 186 children with DS and 186 children with TD, with a mental age (MA) of 8–29 months and matched on gender and MA. Information about vocabulary was obtained using a new Spanish adaptation of the MacArthur–Bates CDI for children with DS. Results: No significant differences in oral production were found. Lexical comprehension and gestural production of children with DS were superior. Similar to children with TD, gestural production in children with DS decreased as oral production increased. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence to support that lexical comprehension and gesture production are strengths in children with DS. With respect to oral production, our results do not support a specific dissociation between cognitive and lexical development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Novel word learning of persons with aphasia is little studied, even though a better understanding of learning processes would inform development of effective treatment strategies. Recent evidence suggests some remaining verbal learning capacity in persons with aphasia. Long-term maintenance of newly learned active vocabulary has not been reported previously in persons with aphasia. Aims: To explore learning and long-term maintenance of novel words in persons with aphasia. Methods & Procedures: Two English-speaking males with chronic anomic aphasia and two age-matched controls were taught novel names of 20 unfamiliar objects. Half of the words were taught with semantic information (definition) and half without. Participants were instructed to learn the names. The experiment included four training sessions, one post-training test and four follow-up tests administered 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months post-training. We tested explicit learning of the new names through visual confrontation naming. In addition, incidental learning of semantic information was probed over the follow-up period. Outcomes & Results: The two participants with aphasia learned 6–8 of the 20 novel names during the training. However, this new vocabulary dissipated during the 6-month follow- up. As expected, the controls showed better performance both in acquisition and in maintenance of the new vocabulary over the follow-up period. As regards the accuracy of semantic information, the aphasic participant with semantic impairment demonstrated worse incidental learning of semantic information than controls and the participant with intact lexical semantics. Conclusions: Some new vocabulary can be acquired even in chronic aphasia but the ability to spontaneously retrieve the newly learned words gradually dissipates over the weeks following learning. Our results also indicate an interaction between the level of lexical-semantic processing skills and incidental learning of new lexical-semantic knowledge in aphasia.

Abstract = {The role of sensory-motor systems in conceptual understanding has been controversial. It has been proposed that many abstract concepts are understood metaphorically through concrete sensory-motor domains such as actions. Using fMRI, we compared neural responses with literal action (Lit; The daughter grasped the flowers), metaphoric action (Met; The public grasped the idea), and abstract (Abs; The public understood the idea) sentences of varying familiarity. Both Lit and Met sentences activated the left anterior inferior parietal lobule, an area involved in action planning, with Met sentences also activating a homologous area in the right hemisphere, relative to Abs sentences. Both Met and Abs sentences activated the left superior temporal regions associated with abstract language. Importantly, activation in primary motor and biological motion perception regions was inversely correlated with Lit and Met familiarity. These results support the view that the understanding of metaphoric action retains a link to sensory-motor systems involved in action performance. However, the involvement of sensory-motor systems in metaphor understanding changes through a gradual abstraction process whereby relatively detailed simulations are used for understanding unfamiliar metaphors, and these simulations become less detailed and involve only secondary motor regions as familiarity increases. Consistent with these data, we propose that anterior inferior parietal lobule serves as an interface between sensory-motor and conceptual systems and plays an important role in both domains. The similarity of abstract and metaphoric sentences in the activation of left superior temporal regions suggests that action metaphor understanding is not completely based on sensory-motor simulations but relies also on abstract lexical-semantic codes.

Abstract = {It is well established that 2-year-olds attribute a novel label to an object’s global shape rather than local features (i.e., parts). Although recent studies have found that younger infants also attend to global rather than local features when given a label, the test stimuli in these experiments confounded parts and shape by varying both or neither. With infants (16- and 24-month-olds) and adults, this experiment disentangled shape and parts with appropriate test objects. Results showed a clear development of a strategy incorporating multiple cues. Across three age groups, there was an increase in generalizing labels to objects matching the exemplar’s local and global features (parts, base, and shape), and a decrease to objects matching in only one local feature. We discuss these results in terms of a learned flexibility in using multiple cues to predict lexical categories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Recent research suggests that there is a processing distinction between consonants and vowels in visual-word recognition. Here we conjointly examine the time course of consonants and vowels in processes of letter identity and letter position assignment. Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants read words and pseudowords in a lexical decision task. The stimuli were displayed under different conditions in a masked priming paradigm with a 50-ms SOA: (i) identity/baseline condition e.g., chocolate- CHOCOLATE); (ii) vowels-delayed condition (e.g., choc░l░te-CHOCOLATE); (iii) consonants-delayed condition (cho░o░ate-CHOCOLATE); (iv) consonants-transposed condition (cholocate-CHOCOLATE); (v) vowels-transposed condition (chocalote-CHOCOLATE), and (vi) unrelated condition (editorial-CHOCOLATE). Results showed earlier ERP effects and longer reaction times for the delayed-letter compared to the transposed-letter conditions. Furthermore, at early stages of processing, consonants may play a greater role during letter identity processing. Differences between vowels and consonants regarding letter position assignment are discussed in terms of a later phonological level involved in lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {In the present study, we followed the standard practice in the literature on masked priming. The present masked priming experiments were designed to shed some light on the intricacies of handwritten words at the earliest stages of word processing. The findings were clear. First, in the semantic categorization task, we found a sizeable masked repetition priming effect with handwritten prime words for man-made words. The present study has one obvious implication: A powerful tool such as the masked priming technique can be employed in experiments with handwritten primes. In sum, handwriting word recognition raises a number of critical issues about how the brain is able to deal with a rather intricate input. The present study has shown that easy-to- read handwritten words can activate the appropriate lexical entry when using the masked priming technique across two different experimental tasks: semantic categorization and lexical decision (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Previous research has described patients with aphasia from thalamic lesions, some of whom were non-fluent with intact comprehension, others who were fluent with impaired comprehension, and some of whom are non-fluent with impaired comprehension. Whereas these three subtypes usually have normal repetition, they had impaired naming, suggesting a deficit in lexical (phonological word forms)-semantic processing. We report a patient with a left thalamic hemorrhage in which lexical-semantic representations appear to be intact but the patient demonstrates an inability to spontaneously activate his lexical-semantic system Methods: A 82-year-old, right-handed man presented with decreased verbal fluency and memory loss following a thalamic hemorrhage. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant decrements in verbal fluency with intact naming, comprehension, repetition and vocabulary. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge this pattern of language disturbance, which mirrors dynamic aphasia induced by frontal lesions, has not previously been described with thalamic injury. The thalamus has strong connections with the frontal lobe and rather than degradation of lexical-semantic representations, this patient’s thalamic lesion probably induced frontal lobe dysfunction with a failure to spontaneously active lexical semantic representations.

Abstract = {I present a new interpretation of reaction time (RT) data from behavioural experiments. From a physical perspective, the entropy of the RT distribution—the temporal entropy —provides a model-free estimate of the amount of processing performed by the cognitive system. This new measure shifts the focus from the conventional interpretation of RTs being either long or short, into their distribution being more or less complex in terms of entropy. I introduce the formulation of the theory, followed by an empirical test using a large database of human RTs in lexical processing tasks. Using the measure, I obtain estimates of the processing loads to individual stimuli (i.e., words), as well as estimates for the overall rate at which the system processes information in these tasks. The relation between the temporal entropy and the RTs can be captured by a simple linear equation. I argue that this equation constitutes the equivalent of a ‘phase diagram’ of a task, providing indications about the different mechanisms that are at play in it, and locating critical points signalling the transitions between these different mechanisms. The results suggest an adaptive system that adjusts its operational processing speed to the demands of each individual stimulus. This finding is in contradiction with a generalization of Hick’s Law positing a relatively constant processing speed within an experimental context.

Abstract = {Delays in language production in children with autism (ASD) are now well known. For parents and clinicians, the possibility of using the first vocal productions as prognostic indications has been tempting. However, such an approach implies questions of predictability and the development of language. To describe and analyze certain relationships between phonological and lexical development with the aim of determining a simple prognostic indicator, 60 children were observed twice, at 5 years of age (T1) and three years later (T2). Linguistic data were obtained in a semi-standardized situation (ADOS-G) and from parents (ADI-R, Item 19), and analyzed with CHILDES. At T1, the sample was distributed into a ‘verbal’ and a ‘non-verbal’ group. From T1 to T2, the sample replicated the four trajectories known from pathological development characterized by stability, progression and regression. A multiple regression analysis for predicting morpheme production at T2 showed that two general markers (CARS and DLS, being ‘risk factors’) and one specific marker (phoneme production, a ‘protection’ factor) were significantly related to lexical development.

Abstract = {There exists an increasing body of research demonstrating that language processing is aided by context-based predictions. Recent findings suggest that the brain generates estimates about the likely physical appearance of upcoming words based on syntactic predictions: words that do not physically look like the expected syntactic category show increased amplitudes in the visual M100 component, the first salient MEG response to visual stimulation. This research asks whether violations of predictions based on lexical–semantic information might similarly generate early visual effects. In a picture–noun matching task, we found early visual effects for words that did not accurately describe the preceding pictures. These results demonstrate that, just like syntactic predictions, lexical–semantic predictions can affect early visual processing around ∼100 ms, suggesting that the M100 response is not exclusively tuned to recognizing visual features relevant to syntactic category analysis. Rather, the brain might generate predictions about upcoming visual input whenever it can. However, visual effects of lexical–semantic violations only occurred when a single lexical item could be predicted. We argue that this may be due to the fact that in natural language processing, there is typically no straightforward mapping between lexical–semantic fields (e.g., flowers) and visual or auditory forms (e.g., tulip, rose, magnolia). For syntactic categories, in contrast, certain form features do reliably correlate with category membership. This difference may, in part, explain why certain syntactic effects typically occur much earlier than lexical–semantic effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In some theories of sentence comprehension, linguistically relevant lexical knowledge, such as selectional restrictions, is privileged in terms of the time-course of its access and influence. We examined whether event knowledge computed by combining multiple concepts can rapidly influence language understanding even in the absence of selectional restriction violations. Specifically, we investigated whether instruments can combine with actions to influence comprehension of ensuing patients of (as in Rayner, Warren, Juhuasz, & Liversedge, 2004; Warren & McConnell, 2007). Instrument-verb-patient triplets were created in a norming study designed to tap directly into event knowledge. In self-paced reading (Experiment 1), participants were faster to read patient nouns, such as hair, when they were typical of the instrument-action pair (Donna used the shampoo to wash vs. the hose to wash). Experiment 2 showed that these results were not due to direct instrument-patient relations. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 1 using eyetracking, with effects of event typicality observed in first fixation and gaze durations on the patient noun. This research demonstrates that conceptual event-based expectations are computed and used rapidly and dynamically during on-line language comprehension. We discuss relationships among plausibility and predictability, as well as their implications. We conclude that selectional restrictions may be best considered as event-based conceptual knowledge rather than lexical-grammatical knowledge.

Abstract = {How does prior context influence lexical and discourse-level processing during real-time language comprehension? Experiment 1 examined whether the referential ambiguity introduced by a repeated, anaphoric expression had an immediate or delayed effect on lexical and discourse processing, using an eye-tracking-while-reading task. Eye movements indicated facilitated recognition of repeated expressions, suggesting that prior context can rapidly influence lexical processing. However, context effects at the discourse level affected later processing, appearing in longer regression-path durations 2 words after the anaphor and in greater rereading times of the antecedent expression. Experiments 2 and 3 explored the nature of this delay by examining the role of the preceding context in activating relevant representations. Offline and online interpretations confirmed that relevant referents were activated following the critical context. Nevertheless, their initial unavailability during comprehension suggests a robust temporal division between lexical and discourse-level processing.

Abstract = {Spoken word recognition is achieved via competition between activated lexical candidates that match the incoming speech input. The competition is modulated by prelexical cues that are important for segmenting the auditory speech stream into linguistic units. One such prelexical cue that listeners rely on in spoken word recognition is phonotactics. Phonotactics defines possible combinations of phonemes within syllables or words in a given language. The present study aimed at investigating both temporal and topographical aspects of the neuronal correlates of phonotactic processing by simultaneously applying ERPs and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Pseudowords, either phonotactically legal or illegal with respect to the participants' native language, were acoustically presented to passively listening adult native German speakers. ERPs showed a larger N400 effect for phonotactically legal compared to illegal pseudowords, suggesting stronger lexical activation mechanisms in phonotactically legal material. fNIRS revealed a left hemispheric network including fronto-temporal regions with greater response to phonotactically legal pseudowords than to illegal pseudowords. This confirms earlier hypotheses on a left hemispheric dominance of phonotactic processing most likely due to the fact that phonotactics is related to phonological processing and represents a segmental feature of language comprehension. These segmental linguistic properties of a stimulus are predominantly processed in the left hemisphere. Thus, our study provides first insights into temporal and topographical characteristics of phonotactic processing mechanisms in a passive listening task. Differential brain responses between known and unknown phonotactic rules thus supply evidence for an implicit use of phonotactic cues to guide lexical activation mechanisms.

Abstract = {This study investigates the processing of resyllabified words by native English speakers at three proficiency levels in French and by native French speakers In particular, it examines non-native listeners' development of a parsing procedure for recognizing vowel-initial words in the context of liaison, a process that creates a misalignment of the syllable and word boundaries in French. The participants completed an eye-tracking experiment in which they identified liaison- and consonant-initial real and nonce words in auditory stimuli. The results show that the non-native listeners had little difficulty recognizing liaison-initial real words, and they recognized liaison-initial nonce words more rapidly than consonant-initial ones. By contrast, native listeners recognized consonant-initial real and nonce words more rapidly than liaison-initial ones. These results suggest that native and non-native listeners used different parsing procedures for recognizing liaison-initial words in the task, with the non-native listeners ' ability to segment liaison-initial words being phonologically abstract rather than lexical.

Abstract = {Emotional meaning impacts word processing. However, it is unclear, at which functional locus this influence occurs and whether and how it depends on word class. These questions were addressed by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) in a lexical decision task with written adjectives, verbs, and nouns of positive, negative, and neutral emotional valence. In addition, word frequency (high vs. low) was manipulated. The early posterior negativity (EPN) in ERPs started earlier for emotional nouns and adjectives than for verbs. Depending on word class, EPN onsets coincided with or followed the lexicality effects. Main ERP effects of emotion overlapped with effects of word frequency between 300 and 550 ms but interacted with them only after 500 ms. These results indicate that in all three word classes examined, emotional evaluation as represented by the EPN has a post-lexical locus, starting already after a minimum of lexical access.

Abstract = {Background: Among the factors that influence word retrieval are characteristics of the stimulus (e.g., length, frequency), characteristics of the individual (e.g., age, education), and characteristics of the task itself. Task factors have not been studied as thoroughly as stimulus and individual factors; in fact, it is often implicitly assumed that groups should be expected to perform similarly in any task involving lexical retrieval. Aims: This assumption was explicitly investigated in the current study by comparing word retrieval in healthy younger, middle-aged and older adults using three tasks with different stimulus and response characteristics. We hypothesised that the degree of constraint of the task would negatively affect word-retrieval performance in normally ageing participants. Methods & Procedures: Word retrieval was examined in three tasks: picture naming, vocabulary definition, and verbal fluency. The relationship of performance to age and education within each task, and the relationships of performance across tasks, were examined in order to clarify the nature of age-related word-retrieval decline. Outcomes & Results: Age-related declines in word retrieval were found in picture naming and verbal fluency tasks, whereas an age advantage was found for vocabulary definition. Conclusions: The task constraint hypothesis was partly supported. Unanticipated results require a revision of the hypothesis to take into account the nature of the constraints in each task, relative to the mechanisms underlying age-related declines in lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {The aim of computational semantics is to capture the meaning of natural language expressions in representations suitable for performing inferences, in the service of understanding human language in written or spoken form. First-order logic is a good starting point, both from the representation and inference point of view. But even if one makes the choice of first-order logic as representation language, this is not enough: the computational semanticist needs to make further decisions on how to model events, tense, modal contexts, anaphora and plural entities. Semantic representations are usually built on top of a syntactic analysis, using unification, techniques from the lambda-calculus or linear logic, to do the book-keeping of variable naming. Inference has many potential applications in computational semantics. One way to implement inference is using algorithms from automated deduction dedicated to first-order logic, such as theorem proving and model building. Theorem proving can help in finding contradictions or checking for new information. Finite model building can be seen as a complementary inference task to theorem proving, and it often makes sense to use both procedures in parallel. The models produced by model generators for texts not only show that the text is contradiction-free; they also can be used for disambiguation tasks and linking interpretation with the real world. To make interesting inferences, often additional background knowledge is required (not expressed in the analysed text or speech parts). This can be derived (and turned into first-order logic) from raw text, semistructured databases or large-scale lexical databases such as WordNet. Promising future research directions of computational semantics are investigating alternative representation and inference methods (using weaker variants of first-order logic, reasoning with defaults), and developing evaluation methods measuring the semantic adequacy of systems and formalisms.

Abstract = {Sereno, O’Donnell, and Sereno (2009) reported that words are recognized faster in a lexical decision task when their referents are physically large than when they are small, suggesting that 'semantic size' might be an important variable that should be considered in visual word recognition research and modelling. We sought to replicate their size effect, but failed to find a significant latency advantage in lexical decision for 'big' words (cf. 'small' words), even though we used the same word stimuli as Sereno et al. and had almost three times as many subjects. We also examined existing data from visual word recognition megastudies (e.g., English Lexicon Project) and found that semantic size is not a significant predictor of lexical decision performance after controlling for the standard lexical variables. In summary, the null results from our lab experiment—despite a much larger subject sample size than Sereno et al.—converged with our analysis of megastudy lexical decision performance, leading us to conclude that semantic size does not matter for word recognition. Discussion focuses on why semantic size (unlike some other semantic variables) is unlikely to play a role in lexical decision. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The cross modal repetition priming paradigm was used to investigate how potential lexically ambiguous no-release variants are processed. In particular we focus on segmental regularities that affect the variant’s frequency of occurrence (voicing of the critical segment) and phonological context in which the variant occurs (status of the following word-initial segment). Primes consisted of carrier words ending in a segment likely (voiced; e.g., BAND) or unlikely (voiceless; PLANT) to be produced in no-release form followed by a consonant or vowel onset context word. Each carrier word had an embedded lexical competitor (embedded word) formed by the segments prior to its final consonant (e.g., plan in plant). Productions of these embedded words (true embedded word) were also used as primes. Both true embedded words (Experiments 1a–1c) and carrier words (Experiments 2a–2c) were used as visual targets. The results are discussed in terms of the contribution of probabilistic speech events to theories of spoken word recognition and lexical competition.

Abstract = {Rhyming words, as in songs or poems, is a universal feature of human language across all ages. In the present fMRI study a novel overt rhyming task was applied to determine the neural correlates of rhyme production. Fifteen right-handed healthy male volunteers participated in this verbal fluency study. Participants were instructed to overtly articulate as many words as possible either to a given initial letter (LVF) or to a semantic category (SVF). During the rhyming verbal fluency task (RVF), participants had to generate words that rhymed with pseudoword stimuli. On-line overt verbal responses were audiotaped in order to correct the imaging results for the number of generated words. Fewer words were generated in the rhyming compared to both the lexical and the semantic condition. On a neural level, all language tasks activated a language network encompassing the left inferior frontal gyrus, the middle and superior temporal gyri as well as the contralateral right cerebellum. Rhyming verbal fluency compared to both lexical and semantic verbal fluency demonstrated significantly stronger activation of left inferior parietal region. Generating novel rhyme words seems to be mainly mediated by the left inferior parietal lobe, a region previously found to be associated with meta-phonological as well as sub-lexical linguistic processes.

Abstract = {This paper analyses whether negation, as a modifier of degree, leads to different outcomes based on the psychophysical structure of the polar dimension along which the shift produced by the negator 'not' occurs. In three experiments, the interpretation of negation in association with four different types of dimension was analysed. The types comprised: (1) strongly asymmetrical dimensions, topologically defined (in terms of the characteristics of Pole a/intermediates/Pole b) as unbounded range/no intermediates/point (e.g., open-closed); (2) moderately asymmetrical dimensions, topologically defined as unbounded range/range of intermediates/bounded range (e.g., wide-narrow); (3) slightly symmetrical dimensions, topologically defined as point/range of intermediates/point (e.g., full-empty); and (4) symmetrical dimensions, topologically defined as bounded range/point/bounded range (e.g., above-below). Results showed that the function of negation varies depending on which type of dimension is involved. These results are discussed in relation to previous literature, where the definition of various types of antonyms was based on the applicability of different lexical modifiers of degree.

Abstract = {We report an eye movement experiment that investigated whether prior exposure to morphologically related and unrelated primes influenced processing of a target word that appeared later in the same sentence. Prime-target pairs had a semantically transparent (e.g., marshy-marsh) or only an apparent morphological relationship (e.g., secretary-secret), or were morphologically unrelated but overlapped in orthography (e.g., extract-extra). Reading times for target words revealed facilitation effects in measures of both early and late processing only for targets that followed semantically transparent morphological primes, providing evidence of semantically mediated priming between words read normally in a sentence. In addition, an increase in target word skipping and in regressions from a posttarget region when targets followed primes rather than control words, regardless of the morphological relationship between the words, suggests that prime-target orthographic overlap influences parafoveal processing of target words. We discuss our findings in relation to morphological priming during isolated word recognition and the process of lexical identification during reading.

Abstract = {Previous studies have repeatedly demonstrated the impact of Gestalt structural grouping principles upon the parsing of motion correspondence in ambiguous apparent motion. Here, by embedding Chinese characters in a visual Ternus display that comprised two stimulus frames, we showed that the perception of visual apparent motion can be modulated by activation of task-irrelevant lexical representations. Each frame had two disks, with the second disk of the first frame and the first disk of the second frame being presented at the same location. Observers could perceive either 'element motion,' in which the endmost disk is seen as moving back and forth while the middle disk at the central position remains stationary, or 'group motion,' in which both disks appear to move laterally as a whole. More reports of group motion, as opposed to element motion, were obtained when the embedded characters formed two-character compound words than when they formed nonwords, although this lexicality effect appeared to be attenuated by the use of the same characters at the overlapping position across the two frames. Thus, grouping of visual elements in a changing world can be guided by both structural principles and prior world knowledge, including lexical information.

Abstract = {We used eye-tracking to investigate lexical processing in aphasic participants by examining the fixation time course for rhyme (e.g., carrot–parrot) and cohort (e.g., beaker–beetle) competitors. Broca's aphasic participants exhibited larger rhyme competition effects than age-matched controls. A re-analysis of previously reported data (Yee, Blumstein, & Sedivy, 2008) confirmed that Wernicke's aphasic participants exhibited larger cohort competition effects. Individual-level analyses revealed a negative correlation between rhyme and cohort competition effect size across both groups of aphasic participants. Computational model simulations were performed to examine which of several accounts of lexical processing deficits in aphasia might account for the observed effects. Simulation results revealed that slower deactivation of lexical competitors could account for increased cohort competition in Wernicke's aphasic participants; auditory perceptual impairment could account for increased rhyme competition in Broca's aphasic participants; and a perturbation of a parameter controlling selection among competing alternatives could account for both patterns, as well as the correlation between the effects. In light of these simulation results, we discuss theoretical accounts that have the potential to explain the dynamics of spoken word recognition in aphasia and the possible roles of anterior and posterior brain regions in lexical processing and cognitive control.

Abstract = {The main point of our study was to examine the vocabulary knowledge of pupils in grades 3–6, and in particular the relative reading vocabulary disadvantage of hearing-impaired pupils. The achievements of 394 pupils with normal hearing and 106 pupils with a hearing impairment were examined on two vocabulary assessment tasks: a lexical decision task and a use decision task. The target words in both tasks represent the vocabulary children should have at the end of primary school. The results showed that most hearing pupils reached this norm, whereas most hearing-impaired pupils did not. In addition, results showed that hearing-impaired pupils not only knew fewer words, but that they also knew them less well. This lack of deeper knowledge remained even when matching hearing and hearing-impaired children on minimal word knowledge. Additionally, comparison of the two tasks demonstrated the efficacy of the lexical decision task as a measure of lexical semantic knowledge.

In adulthood, he suffered a large right perisylvian stroke and developed atypical conduction aphasia with deficits in input and output phonological processing and poor auditory-verbal short-term memory. Lexical-semantic processing for single words was intact, but he was unable to access meaning in sentence comprehension and repetition. Reading and writing deficits worsened after the stroke and he presented a combination of developmental and acquired dysgraphia and dyslexia with mixed lexical and phonological processing deficits. This case suggest that a small lesion sustained prenatally or early in life could induce a selective rightward shift of phonology sparing the standard left hemisphere lateralisation of lexical-semantic functions.

Abstract = {Can transfer occur in child bilingual syntax when surface overlap does not involve the syntax-pragmatics interface? Twenty-three Spanish/English bilingual children participated in an elicited imitation study of clitic placement in Spanish restructuring contexts, where variable word order is not associated with pragmatic or semantic factors. Bilingual children performed poorly with preverbal clitics, the order that does not overlap with English. Distinct bilingual patterns emerged: backward repositioning, omissions (for simultaneous bilinguals) and a reduction in forward repositioning bias. We conclude that transfer should be defined in lexical terms as the result of priming effects leading to shifts in lexical items. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Adult production is influenced by the larger linguistic contexts in which words appear. Children, like adults, hear words in recurring linguistic contexts, but little is known on the effect of that context on their speech. We look at the production of irregular plurals in English (e.g., mice, feet) to argue that children attend to the larger phrases words appear in and make use of that distributional knowledge in production. We assess the role of linguistic context by comparing irregular plurals elicited with a general question (What are all these?) versus a lexically specific frequent frame (e.g., Three blind—). In study 1, 4;6 year-olds produced many more correct irregulars after lexically specific frequent frames (72%) than after a general question (32%). Corpus data on spontaneous speech offered analogous findings: Children did not overregularize irregular plurals after lexically-specific frames. In study 2, we confirm children’s sensitivity to the relation between particular words and phrases: A familiar frame (So many) enhanced production (52%) but not as much as the lexically specific frames in Study 1. Children’s word production is affected by the larger patterns words appear in. Consequently, studies of lexical and morphological acquisition need to take linguistic context into account when assessing children’s abilities. This has implications for models of both lexical and morphological acquisition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {While many behavioural studies on refractory phenomena in lexical/semantic access have focused on the mechanisms involved in the oral production of names, comprehension tasks have been almost exclusively used in neuropsychological studies on brain damaged patients. We report the results of two experiments on healthy participants conducted by means of speeded word to picture matching tasks. They assess the effects of the same variables examined in the study of refractory access dysphasic patients: semantic distance and word frequency (experiment 1) and presentation rate and serial position effects (experiment 2). Semantic access patients usually show little effect of word frequency but a large semantic distance effect. However, critical in characterising the syndrome as ‘refractory’, effects of presentation rate and serial position should also be present. The experiments involved the use of a deadline response procedure. The critical manipulation was the absence of a Response Stimulus Interval (RSI) in the fast presentation rate conditions; slower presentation rates involved 1 s RSI. With these manipulations the typical behavioural pattern of performance provided by semantic access dysphasic patients was reproduced. Semantic distance effects were more powerful than word frequency effects (experiment1). Presentation rate effects were found and, most important for a 'refractory' account of the effects, a serial position effect was obtained (experiment 2). These results provide the first evidence of such a broad range of refractory effects at the same time in comprehension tasks in healthy subjects and support a purely semantic account for the locus of refractoriness. Moreover, error analysis showed a predominance of perseverative errors with subsequent representations of the same target, supporting a failure of cognitive control mechanisms as the cause of refractory behaviour. The findings are discussed in the light of current models of lexical and semantic processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We show that comprehenders’ expectations about upcoming discourse coherence relations influence the resolution of local structural ambiguity. We employ cases in which two clauses share both a syntactic relationship and a discourse relationship, and hence in which syntactic and discourse processing might be expected to interact. An off-line sentence-completion study and an on-line self-paced reading study examined readers’ expectations for high/low relative-clause attachments following implicit-causality and non-implicit causality verbs (John detests/babysits the children of the musician who…). In the off-line study, the widely reported low-attachment preference for English is observed in the non-implicit causality condition, but this preference gives way to more high attachments in the implicit-causality condition in cases in which (i) the verb’s causally implicated referent occupies the high-attachment position and (ii) the relative clause provides an explanation for the event described by the matrix clause (e.g., …who are arrogant and rude). In the on-line study, a similar preference for high attachment emerges in the implicit-causality context—crucially, before the occurrence of any linguistic evidence that the RC does in fact provide an explanation—whereas the low-attachment preference is consistent elsewhere. These findings constitute the first demonstration that expectations about ensuing discourse coherence relationships can elicit full reversals in syntactic attachment preferences, and that these discourse-level expectations can affect on-line disambiguation as rapidly as lexical and morphosyntactic cues.

Abstract = {Word recognition is a balancing act: listeners must be sensitive to phonetic detail to avoid confusing similar words, yet, at the same time, be flexible enough to adapt to phonetically variable pronunciations, such as those produced by speakers of different dialects or by non‐native speakers. Recent work has demonstrated that young toddlers are sensitive to phonetic detail during word recognition; pronunciations that deviate from the typical phonological form lead to a disruption of processing. However, it is not known whether young word learners show the flexibility that is characteristic of adult word recognition. The present study explores whether toddlers can adapt to artificial accents in which there is a vowel category shift with respect to the native language. Nineteen‐month‐olds heard mispronunciations of familiar words (e.g. vowels were shifted from [a] to [æ]: ‘dog’ pronounced as ‘dag’). In test, toddlers were tolerant of mispronunciations if they had recently been exposed to the same vowel shift, but not if they had been exposed to standard pronunciations or other vowel shifts. The effects extended beyond particular items heard in exposure to words sharing the same vowels. These results indicate that, like adults, toddlers show flexibility in their interpretation of phonological detail. Moreover, they suggest that effects of top‐down knowledge on the reinterpretation of phonological detail generalize across the phono‐lexical system.

Abstract = {Metaphonological tasks, such as rhyme judgment, have been the primary tool for the investigation of the effects of orthographic knowledge on spoken language. However, it has been recently argued that the orthography effect in rhyme judgment does not reflect the automatic activation of orthographic codes but rather stems from sophisticated response strategies. Such a claim stands in sharp contrast with recent findings using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in lexical and semantic tasks, which were taken to suggest that orthographic information occurs early enough to affect the core process of lexical access. Here, we show that the electrophysiological signature of the orthography effect in rhyme judgment is indeed different from the one obtained in online lexical or semantic tasks. That is, we did not find the orthography effect in the 300–350 ms time window which has previously been shown to process lexical information in the lexico-semantic tasks, but the effect appeared within the 175–250 ms and the 375–750 ms time-windows which we interpreted to reflect segmentation and decisional process, respectively. We conclude that the interactions between phonology and orthography are task-specific. Metaphonological tasks appear of limited use for studying the core processes and interactions that underlie lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The goal of this research programme was to evaluate the role of word lexicality in effecting phonological change in children's sound systems. Four children with functional speech sound disorders (SSDs) were enrolled in an across-subjects multiple baseline single-subject design; two were treated using high-frequency real words (RWs) and two were treated using (low-frequency) non-words (NWs). Dependent variables were learning during treatment, generalization of treated and untreated sounds post-treatment and error consistency indices. The oldest child in the NW group demonstrated slightly greater increases in learning during treatment, and both children demonstrated increases in generalization as well as large decreases in sound error variability. In comparison, one child in the RW group demonstrated untreated sound generalization, as well as decreases in sound error variability. These results suggest that NWs may be useful in helping children learn the sound structure of words containing treated sounds. These findings are interpreted within an established connectionist model accounting for phonological and lexical representations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Fluent aphasia of the anomic and Wernicke's type is characterized by word retrieval difficulties. However, in fluent aphasic speech, grammatical deviations have been observed as well. There is debate as to whether these grammatical problems are caused by the word retrieval deficit, by an additional grammatical deficit, or by an integration deficit. Verbs are an interesting word class in this respect, because they are among the words that are hardest to retrieve for many fluent aphasic speakers and some forms require a considerable amount of grammatical computation. For production of a finite lexical verb, the lexical form and inflection for tense and agreement need to be integrated. In the present study, the use of lexical verbs in finite and nonfinite form in the spontaneous speech of 8 Dutch fluent aphasic speakers was analyzed. The results show that retrieval of lexical verbs decreases when more grammatical information needs to be computed. It will be argued that this is best accounted for in terms of an integration deficit: the more computation is needed to express a relation between a verb and intrasentential (agreement) and extrasentential (tense) information, the more difficult it is to retrieve a normal range of lexical verbs.

Abstract = {The goal of this research was to disentangle effects of phonotactic probability, the likelihood of occurrence of a sound sequence, and neighborhood density, the number of phonologically similar words, in lexical acquisition. Two-word learning experiments were conducted with 4-year-old children. Experiment 1 manipulated phonotactic probability while holding neighborhood density and referent characteristics constant. Experiment 2 manipulated neighborhood density while holding phonotactic probability and referent characteristics constant. Learning was tested at two time points (immediate vs. retention) in both a naming and referent identification task, although only data from the referent identification task were analysed due to poor performance in the naming task. Results showed that children were more accurate in learning rare sound sequences than common sound sequences and this was consistent across time points. In contrast, the effect of neighborhood density varied by time. Children were more accurate in learning sparse sound sequences than dense sound sequences at the immediate test point but accuracy for dense sound sequences significantly improved by the retention test without further training. It was hypothesized that phonotactic probability and neighborhood density influenced different cognitive processes that underlie lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {A central question in spoken word recognition research is whether words are recognized relationally, in the context of other words in the mental lexicon (McClelland and Elman, 1986; Luce and Pisoni, 1998). The current research evaluated metrics for measuring the influence of the mental lexicon on visually perceived (lipread) spoken word recognition. Lexical competition (the extent to which perceptually similar words influence recognition of a stimulus word) was quantified using metrics that are well-established in the literature, as well as a novel statistical method for calculating perceptual confusability, based on the Phi-square statistic. The Phi-square statistic proved an effective measure for assessing lexical competition and explained significant variance in visual spoken word recognition beyond that accounted for by traditional metrics. Because these values include the influence of a large subset of the lexicon (rather than only perceptually similar words), it suggests that even perceptually distant words may receive some activation, and therefore provide competition, during spoken word recognition. This work supports and extends earlier research (Auer, 2002; Mattys et al., 2002) that proposed a common recognition system underlying auditory and visual spoken word recognition and provides support for the use of the Phi-square statistic for quantifying lexical competition.

Abstract = {This study reports two experiments assessing the spelling performance of French first graders after 3 months and after 9 months of literacy instruction. The participants were asked to spell high and low frequency irregular words (Experiment 1) and pseudowords, some of which had lexical neighbours (Experiment 2). The lexical database which children had been exposed to was strictly controlled. Both a frequency effect in word spelling accuracy and an analogy effect in pseudoword spelling were obtained after only 3 months of reading instruction. The results suggest that children establish specific orthographic knowledge from the very beginning of literacy acquisition.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the extent to which the location of primary stress in Dutch, German, and English monomorphemic words is affected by the syllables preceding the three final syllables. We present analyses of the monomorphemic words in the CELEX lexical database, which showed that penultimate primary stress is less frequent in Dutch and English trisyllabic than quadrisyllabic words. In addition, we discuss paper-and-pencil experiments in which native speakers assigned primary stress to pseudowords. These experiments provided evidence that in all three languages penultimate stress is more likely in quadrisyllabic than in trisyllabic words. We explain this length effect with the preferences in these languages for word-initial stress and for alternating patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables. The experimental data also showed important intra- and interspeaker variation, and they thus form a challenging test case for theories of language variation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR], Copyrig)},

First, to optimize the transfer of information between the user and the system, we introduce a new active learning selection criterion that minimizes redundancy between the candidate images shown to the user.

Abstract = {Agent technologies represent a promising approach for the integration of interorganizational capabilities across distributed, networked environments. However, knowledge sharing interoperability problems can arise when agents incorporating differing ontologies try to synchronize their internal information. Moreover, in practice, agents may not have a common or global consensus ontology that will facilitate knowledge sharing and integration of functional capabilities. We propose a method to enable agents to develop a local consensus ontology during operation time as needed. By identifying similarities in the ontologies of their peer agents, a set of agents can discover new concepts/relations and integrate them into a local consensus ontology on demand. We evaluate this method, both syntactically and semantically, when forming local consensus ontologies with and without the use of a lexical database.

Abstract = {Abstract: This study investigated the effect of word familiarity of visual stimuli on the word recognizing function of a human brain. Word familiarity is an index of the relative ease of word perception, and is characterized by facilitation and accuracy on word recognition. We studied the effect of word familiarity, using “Hiragana” (phonetic characters in Japanese orthography) characters as visual stimuli, on the elicitation of visually evoked magnetic fields with a word-naming task. The words were selected from a database of lexical properties of Japanese. The four “Hiragana” characters used were grouped and presented in four classes of degree of familiarity. The three components were observed in averaged waveforms of the root mean square (RMS) value on latencies at about 100, 150 and 220 ms. The RMS value of the 220 ms component showed a significant positive correlation (F=(3/36); 5.501; p=0.035) with the value of familiarity. ECDs of the 220 ms component were observed in the intra)},

The program also has a module to calculate the respective values of these variables for items that have already been constructed, either with the program or taken from earlier studies. Stimulus queries can be entered through WordGen's graphical user interface or by means of batch files.

Recent work on the computing of semantic distances among nodes (synsets) in WordNet has made it possible to build a large database of semantic distances for use in selecting word pairs for psychological research. The database now contains nearly 50,000 pairs of words that have values for semantic distance, associative strength, and similarity based on co-occurrence. Semantic distance was found to correlate weakly with these other measures but to correlate more strongly with another measure of semantic relatedness, featural similarity. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the knowledge structure underlying semantic distance is similar in gross form to that underlying featural similarity. In experiments in which semantic similarity ratings were used, human participants were able to discriminate semantic distance. Thus, semantic distance as derived from W)},

Abstract = {This paper presents a suite of methods and results for the semantic disambiguation of WordNet glosses. WordNet is a resource widely used in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Intended and designed as a lexical database, WordNet exhibits some deficiencies when used as a knowledge base. By semantically disambiguating the words in the glosses, we add pointers from each word to its concept or synset, and this increases the connectivity between the WordNet concepts by approximately an order of magnitude. We show how lexical chains and other applications can be built on this richly connected WordNet. The semantic disambiguation of the WordNet glosses is performed using automatic methods based on a set of heuristics. The precision of the semantic annotation is improved by using voting between the disambiguation system described here and another WSD system. The entire WordNet 2.0 has been disambiguated with an overall precision of 86% and is available at . [Copyright &y&)},

Abstract = {Structural ambiguity, particularly attachment of prepositional phrases, is a serious type of global ambiguity in Natural Language. The disambiguation becomes crucial when a syntactic analyzer must make the correct decision among at least two equally grammatical parse-trees for the same sentence. This paper attempts to find answers to the problem of how attachment ambiguity can be resolved by utilizing Machine Learning (ML) techniques. ML is founded on the assumption that the performance in cognitive tasks is based on the similarity of new situations (testing) to stored representations of earlier experiences (training). Therefore, a large amount of training data is an important prerequisite for providing a solution to the problem. A combination of unsupervised and restricted supervised acquisition of such data will be reported. Training is performed both on a subset of the content of the Gothenburg Lexical Database (GLDB), and on instances of large corpora annotated with coarse-grained)},

Abstract = {The role of lexical-semantic neighborhood is relevant to models of lexical access. Recently it has been claimed that the size of the cohort of activated competitors affects ease of lexical selection in word production as well as the effect of semantically related distractors in picture–word interference tasks. Three experiments are reported in which subjects had to name pictures from large and small semantic categories (cf. 'lion,' 'hammer' versus 'funnel,' 'cage'). In Experiment 1, naming-impaired subjects exhibited semantic errors for targets from large categories. No semantic but many omission errors occurred for targets from small categories suggesting that few competitors were available for these 'low competition targets.' In contrast in two experiments with unimpaired subjects, targets were named equally fast. These experiments were sensitive enough to yield a highly significant repetition effect in Experiment 2. Contrary to the explicit predictions of a recent proposal, semantically related distractors caused interference for both groups of words in Experiment 3. The results suggest no role of neighborhood size in the naming of unimpaired individuals. Implications for models of lexical selection are discussed.

Abstract = {The degree to which the MTL system contributes to effective language skills is not well delineated. We sought to determine if the MTL plays a role in single-word decoding in healthy, normal skilled readers. The experiment follows from the implications of the dual-process model of single-word decoding, which provides distinct predictions about the nature of MTL involvement. The paradigm utilized word (regular and irregularly spelled words) and pseudoword (phonetically regular) stimuli that differed in their demand for non-lexical as opposed lexical decoding. The data clearly showed that the MTL system was not involved in single word decoding in skilled, native English readers. Neither the hippocampus nor the MTL system as a whole showed significant activation during lexical or non-lexical based decoding. The results provide evidence that lexical and non-lexical decoding are implemented by distinct but overlapping neuroanatomical networks. Non-lexical decoding appeared most uniquely associated with cuneus and fusiform gyrus activation biased toward the left hemisphere. In contrast, lexical decoding appeared associated with right middle frontal and supramarginal, and bilateral cerebellar activation. Both these decoding operations appeared in the context of a shared widespread network of activations including bilateral occipital cortex and superior frontal regions. These activations suggest that the absence of MTL involvement in either lexical or non-lexical decoding appears likely a function of the skilled reading ability of our sample such that whole-word recognition and retrieval processes do not utilize the declarative memory system, in the case of lexical decoding, and require only minimal analysis and recombination of the phonetic elements of a word, in the case of non-lexical decoding.

Abstract = {This cognitive linguistic corpus-based study embraces Johnson's (1992: 348) embodiment hypothesis to argue that metonymic and metaphorical extensions of the prototypical sense of Modern Greek prosopo are based on a cultural model of the self It is also claimed that conceptual structure and cultural models interact equally in motivating different uses of prosopo, confirming the intimate connection between cultural experience and embodied behavior (Gibbs 1999: 146). Frequently occurring collocations of adjective + prosopo are shown to have developed meanings not directly relatable to either the semantics of prosopo or the semantics of the collocating adjectives, supporting Sinclair's (1991) views on collocational meanings. It is suggested that the embodiment hypothesis is relevant not only to lexicalization and the expression of emotion, character, etc., but also to the emergence of abstract collocational meaning. Finally, the present work suggests the possibility of a methodological convergence of cognitive semantics, cultural models, lexical semantics, and corpus linguistics.

Abstract = {The notion motivational network is proposed to describe the existence of various possibilities of motivation for a given form. As shown in questionnaire studies, this phenomenon is quite common for non-linguist native speakers. But the notion of motivational network is also justified from a cognitive perspective: in the mental lexicon, words in a word family are structured as multidirectional networks, resulting in the co-activation of all family members. Thus, the coexistence of various equally salient motivational partners should not be regarded as exceptional but rather as the default case in lexical motivation.

Abstract = {Background: The effects of stimulus material, lexical content, and response condition on dichotic speech recognition performance characteristics were examined for normal-hearing young adult listeners. No previous investigation has systematically examined the effects of stimulus material with constant phonetic content but varied lexical content across three response conditions typically used to evaluate binaural auditory processing abilities. Purpose: To examine how dichotic speech recognition performance varies for stimulus materials with constant phonetic content but varied lexical content across the free recall, directed recall right, and directed recall left response conditions. Research Design: Dichotic speech recognition was evaluated using consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) word and nonsense CVC syllable stimuli administered in the free recall, directed right, and directed left response conditions, a repealed measures experimental design. Study Sample: Thirty normal-hearing young adults (15 male, 15 female) served as participants. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 31 yr and were all right-handed. Data Collection and Analysis: Participants engaged in monaural speech recognition and dichotic speech recognition, tasks. Percent correct recognition per ear, as well as ear advantage for dichotic speech recognition, were calculated and evaluated using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical procedure. Results: Dichotic speech recognition performance for nonsense CVC syllables was significantly poorer than performance for CVC words, suggesting that lexical content impacts performance on dichotic speech recognition tasks. Performance also varied across response condition, which is consistent with previous studies of dichotic speech recognition. Conclusions: Lexical content of stimulus materials impacts performance characteristics for dichotic speech recognition tasks in the normal-hearing young adult population. The use of nonsense CVC syllable material may provide a way to assess dichotic speech recognition performance while potentially lessening the effects of lexical content on performance.

Abstract = {In multiple properly models of lexical categories, the assignment of a word to a lexical category is determined by a set of properties associated with that category. Specifically, if a word displays a sufficient number of properties associated with a given category, it will be assigned to that category. The current article critically evaluates multiple property models of lexical categories. In particular, it focuses on a multiple property model recently developed by A arts (2007b) and a variety of other such models, It is argued that multiple property models encounter problems in four key areas. Firstly, they struggle to determine an appropriate set of lexical categories and lo provide coherent accounts of the nature and function of such categories. Secondly, they encounter difficulties in determining the properties that define categories and in determining features of properties such as whether they should be weighted or not. Thirdly, a variety of problems arise when multiple property models combine words, properties and categories together. Finally, multiple property models fail to account for crosslinguistic data. It is concluded that multiple property models do not provide viable accounts of lexical categories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Carol Stoel-Gammon (see record [rid]2011-00185-002[/rid]). Stoel-Gammon provides a welcome addition to the phonological acquisition literature, bringing together insights from long-standing and more recent research to address the relationship between the developing phonological system and the developing lexicon. As Stoel-Gammon notes, both phonotactic probability and neighborhood density play a role in understanding the nature of the developing lexicon. This is part of a more general phenomenon that relates the characteristics of the developing lexicon to several levels of phonological structure. This is easier to see from a cross-linguistic perspective, where learners' patterns of both syllable structure and lexical development appear to be closely tied to the frequency of the syllable structure and prosodic word shapes in the ambient language. Children's variable production of both grammatical morphemes and coda consonants is also influenced by the position in which the lexical item occurs in the utterance. Ultimately, these processes will be better understood in the context of a developmental theory of language planning and production, where phonological knowledge and implementation are considered as part of lexical and grammatical competence.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Carol Stoel-Gammon (see record [rid]2011-00185-002[/rid]). The author states that 'from birth to age 2; 6, the developing phonological system affects lexical acquisition to a greater degree than lexical factors affect phonological development'. This conclusion is based on a wealth of data; however, the available data are somewhat limited in scope, focusing on rather holistic measures of the phonological and lexical systems. He suggests a number of important avenues to pursue, but does not discuss a critical one that is emerging in the broader literature on word learning It is likely that triggering is more accurate and efficient when the mismatch between the input and existing representations is maximal, far exceeding the threshold for allocating a new representation. It is likely that configuration is dependent on working memory. That is, a novel sound sequence must be held in working memory so that the details of the sound sequence can be stored in long-term memory. In terms of engagement, the most compelling evidence comes from studies showing changes in responses to trained non words across a one week interval without further training. A more precise statement, based on additional research, has the potential to enhance our understanding of the relationship between phonological and lexical development across the lifespan.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Carol Stoel-Gammon (see record [rid]2011-00185-002[/rid]). According to the prevailing view at the time, accuracy of pronunciation was a peripheral phenomenon that had nothing to do with the development of language qua language. One reason why not, according to Stoel-Gammon (SG), is that the difficulty of accurately producing sounds influences the words children acquire and the rate at which they acquire them. This interaction between the articulatory skill of children and phonological properties of words is just one of the mutual influences between phonology and the lexicon SG describes. In her target article, SG brings together data from a wide range of investigations to build an account of how phonology and the lexicon interact in development. The evidence SG marshals in support of this account includes very recent findings and findings that have been around for a while but have never been incorporated into a larger explanatory structure. SG also brings input into the story, arguing that input affects articulation and that these effects demonstrate the child's sensitivity to the structure of the ambient language. Another topic SG raises for us to consider is the well-established relation between non word repetition accuracy and word learning. SG also endorses the view that lexical development drives phonological development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Parafoveal-on-foveal effects refer to the possibility that processing of the parafoveal word can influence the fixation durations on the foveal word during reading. In this chapter, I will review the literature of studies examining this issue. Effects observed in reading-like tasks have been questioned on methodological grounds with regards to the generalizability to normal reading. The clearest evidence for the existence of parafoveal-on-foveal effects comes from experiments allowing tight control over the stimuli but restricting the observations to fixation locations very close to the parafoveal word, and from corpus studies showing reliable but numerically small effects. I will make the claim that with regards to taking reported parafoveal-on-foveal effects as evidence for parallel lexical processing, the jury is still out. The argument is that as long as parafoveal-on-foveal effects are numerically small and difficult to replicate in a controlled experiment, they can be explained on the basis of mislocated fixations, machine error, and binocular disparity. These latter three influences can create apparent parafoveal-on-foveal effects without being linked to parallel lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Lexical frequency and item familiarity definitely influence name retrieval in clinical studies, but the relevance of concept typicality has been less extensively investigated. A relevant theoretical question is whether familiarity and typicality exert an independent influence on the name retrieval of aphasic patients. In this study we assembled a list of 288 items of the animals category from a semantic fluency task performed by 198 normal subjects in a previous study. The production frequency of a given animal name was used to estimate typicality, and for the whole list of animals a new normal sample estimated familiarity. The newly collected indices were used to analyse semantic fluency and picture naming of FPA, an anoxic patient. On both tasks, familiarity and typicality were more relevant than word frequency. Typicality of each stimulus, and to a lower degree familiarity, were independently able to predict the type of naming response. Thus, the influence of lexical-semantic variables on naming should be viewed, at least in this case, as something endowed with two dimensions (typicality and familiarity), while in other cases also lexical frequency may be relevant.

Abstract = {Purpose: In this study, the authors investigated potential explanations for sparse lexical-semantic representations in children with specific language impairment (SLI) and typically developing peers. The role of auditory perception, phonological working memory, and lexical competition were investigated. Method: Participants included 32 children (ages 8;5-12;3 [years;months]): Sixteen children with SLI and 16 typically developing age- and nonverbal IQ–matched peers (CA). Children’s word definitions were investigated. The words to be defined were manipulated for phonological neighborhood density. Nonword repetition and two lexical competition measures were tested as predictors of word definition abilities. Results: Children with SLI gave word definitions with fewer content details than children in the CA group. Compared with the CA group, the definitions of children in the SLI group were not disproportionately impacted by phonological neighborhood density. Lexical competition was a significant unique predictor of children’s word definitions, but nonword repetition was not. Conclusions: Individual differences in richness of lexical semantic representations as well as differences between children with SLI and typically developing peers may—at least, in part—be explained by processes of competition. However, difficulty with auditory perception or phonological working memory does not fully explain difficulties in lexical semantics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study was aimed at determining the role of prosody and situational context in children’s understanding of expressive utterances. Which one of these 2 cues will help children grasp the speaker’s intention? Do children exhibit a 'contextual bias' whereby they ignore prosody, such as the 'lexical bias' found in other studies (M. Friend & J. Bryant, 2000)? Method: In the first experiment, a group of 5- to 9-year-old children and a group of adults performed a computerized judgment task. They had to determine the speaker’s intention on the basis of an utterance produced with a particular prosody (positive or negative) in a particular situational context (positive or negative). In the second experiment, the same prosodic utterances were presented to 5- to 9-year-old children without a situational context. Results: The 5- and 7-year-old children relied primarily on situational context, in contrast to adults, who relied on prosody. The 9-year-olds relied on both cues (Experiment 1).

Abstract = {In Russian, the phonological diagnostics for prosodic words conflict when applied to compounds. On the one hand, compounds can have multiple stresses (oboròn-o-sposóbnost' ‘defense-linker-capability’), whereas single-root words can only have a single stress. On the other hand, non-stress rules such as word-final devoicing and vowel reduction treat compounds as single prosodic words. Based on this and other kinds of evidence, I demonstrate that compounds are indeed single prosodic words, though they are required to have a stress for each sub-stem. Secondary stress patterns in compounds also provide some clues as to the location of default stress in what is an almost entirely lexical stress system.

Abstract = {Accessing infonnation from memory can make accessing other related information more problematic. The Retrieval-Induced Forgetting (RIF) phenomenon refers to the observation that accessing one specific word (e.g., chair) impairs the successive access to words from the same semantic category (e.g., table) (Anderson et al, 1994). In this article we focused on to explore whether RIF is also reliable in a picture naming task. We explore whether the time to name a picture is affected by a previous memory task, in which participants are asked to memorize pictures from different semantic categories. Pictures in the naming phase could be or not from the same categories as those presented in the memory phase. We observed slower naming latencies for those pictures belonging to semantic categories that were presented to memorize in the first phase. These results suggest the existence of significant interactions between episodic memory and lexical access. We discuss our results in the context of current models of lexical access during speech production. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Structural and content-related deficits occur in connected discourse of patients with semantic dementia (SD). We used principal components analysis (PCA) to characterise the sources of variation in word usage during picture description by controls and SD patients. This data-driven approach allowed: comparison of the distance between individuals in the two-dimensional space; correlational analyses between principal component (PC) values and performance on other tests; identification of words whose variance contributed most to the definition of the PCs. Transcripts of Cookie Theft picture descriptions from 21 patients with SD and 21 controls were used to generate frequencies of all word types (n = 557) across participants. Frequency values of words with ≥ 10 occurrences (n = 81) were entered into a PCA. Values of emergent dimensions were correlated with performance on tests of single word meaning. The first PC accounted for 59% of the variance, the second for a further 10%. Patients and controls showed good separation within the resulting space. Factor loading scores indicated that control performance was characterised by function (factor 1) and content (factor 2) word usage, while patients showed a greater tendency to use pronouns, deictic and generic words. Knowledge of single word meaning correlated with factor 1 but not with factor 2. Differences in word usage can differentiate connected speech of SD patients from controls using a rapid, automated, data-driven algorithm. The distinction between groups, loadings on the two components, and their differential correlations with semantic tasks raise the possibility of independent differences in syntax and lexical content.

Abstract = {Based on an analysis of the speech of long-term émigrés of German and Dutch origin, the present investigation discusses to what extent hesitation patterns in language attrition may be the result of the creation of an interlanguage system, on the one hand, or of language-internal attrition patterns on the other. We compare speech samples elicited by a film retelling task from German émigrés in Canada (n = 52) and the Netherlands (n = 50) and from Dutch émigrés in Canada (n = 45) to retellings produced by predominantly monolingual control groups in Germany (n = 53) and the Netherlands (n = 45). Findings show that the attriting groups overuse empty pauses, repetitions, and retractions,whereas the distribution of filled pauses appears to conform more closely to the second language norm. An investigation of the location at which disfluency markers appear within the sentence suggests that they are indicators of difficulties that the attriters experience largely in the context of lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {There is a considerable linguistic debate on whether phrasal verbs (e.g., turn up, break down) are processed as two separate words connected by a syntactic rule or whether they form a single lexical unit. Moreover, views differ on whether meaning (transparency vs. opacity) plays a role in determining their syntactically-connected or lexical status. As linguistic arguments could not settle these issues, we used neurophysiological brain imaging to address them. Applying a multi-feature Mismatch Negativity (MMN) design with subjects instructed to ignore speech stimuli, we recorded magnetic brain responses to particles (up, down) auditorily presented as infrequent 'deviant' stimuli in the context of frequently occurring verb 'standard' stimuli. Already at latencies below 200 ms, magnetic brain responses were larger to particles appearing in existing phrasal verbs (e.g. rise up) than to particles appearing in non-existing combinations (e.g. fall up), regardless of whether particles carried a literal or metaphorical sense (e.g. rise up, heat up). Previous research found an enhanced MMN response to morphemes in existing (as opposed to non-existing) words but a reduced MMN to words in grammatically acceptable (as opposed to unacceptable) combinations. The increased brain activation to particles in real phrasal verbs reported here is consistent with the lexical enhancement but inconsistent with the syntactic reduction of the MMN, thus providing neurophysiological support that a congruent verb–particle sequence is not assembled syntactically but rather accessed as a single lexical chunk.

Abstract = {In this study, we asked whether native and non-native speakers of English use a similar balance of lexical knowledge and acoustic cues, e.g., juncture-specific allophones, to segment spoken English, and whether the two groups are equally affected by energetic masking (a competing talker) and by cognitive load (a simultaneous visual search task). In intact speech, as well as in both adverse conditions, non-native speakers gave relatively less weight to lexical plausibility than to acoustic cues. Under energetic masking, overall segmentation accuracy decreased, but this decrease was of comparable magnitude in native and non-natives speakers. Under cognitive load, native speakers relied relatively more on lexical plausibility than on acoustic cues. This lexical drift was not observed in the non-native group. These results indicate that non-native speakers pay less attention to lexical information—and relatively more attention to acoustic detail—than previously thought. They also suggest that the penetrability of the speech system by cognitive factors depends on listener’s proficiency with the language, and especially their level of lexical-semantic knowledge.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Allah made us: Sexual outlaws in an Islamic African city by Rudolf Pell Gaudio (see record [rid]2009-06077-000[/rid]). This book ia a very engagingly written, reflexive ethnography of disvalued verbal dexterity among 'yan daudu. This work is filled with insights into the complexities of gendered language use and how sex–gender nonconformists fare in a Muslim city notorious among Nigerian Christians of the south for sodomy before and after the imposition of Shari'a. 'Yan daudu are biological males who have sex with males but mostly also marry and sire children. Both 'yan daudu and their ethnographer were circumspect in talking about sexual conduct—at least the text of the book is. The author contends that 'yan daudu's cultivated proficiency in the use of stigmatized ways of speaking 'reflects a defiant response to their own marginalization and stigmatization'. Anthropologists' tend to see much as 'resistance' and the author goes even farther in interpreting the fatalistic 'Allah made me this way' as a bid for cultural citizenship. It seems that the Hausa 'yan daudu do not fully accept the negative social judgments about what they do but do not reject them fully even in the company of fellow sex–gender 'deviants'. The author does not suggest phonological or syntactic differences. Differences are pragmatic and lexical. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the cognitive processes underlying picture naming and auditory word repetition. In the two-step model of lexical access, both the semantic and phonological steps are involved in naming, but the former has no role in repetition. Assuming recognition of the to-be-repeated word, repetition could consist of retrieving the word’s output phonemes from the lexicon (the lexical-route model), retrieving the output phonology directly from input phonology (the nonlexical-route model) or employing both routes together (the summation dual-route model). We tested these accounts by comparing the size of the word frequency effect (an index of lexical retrieval) in naming and repetition data from 59 aphasic patients with simulations of naming and repetition models. The magnitude of the frequency effect (and the influence of other lexical variables) was found to be comparable in naming and repetition, and equally large for both the lexical and summation dual-route models. However, only the dual-route model was fully consistent with data from patients, suggesting that nonlexical input is added on top of a fully-utilized lexical route.

Abstract = {Introduction: Although spelling difficulties are constantly associated with developmental dyslexia, they have been largely neglected by the majority of studies in this area. This study analyzes spelling impairments in developmental dyslexia across school grades in Italian, a language with high grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence. Methods: The performances of 33 Italian dyslexic children attending Grades 3 and 5 were compared with those of age-matched control participants. Writing abilities were investigated through a spelling test that included regular words with one-sound-to-one-letter correspondence, regular words requiring the application of context-sensitive conversion rules, words with unpredictable transcription and nonwords with one-sound-to-one-letter correspondence. Results: Both accuracy and error analyses indicate that the spelling impairment assumes different characteristics at different grades: Grade 3 children showed an undifferentiated spelling deficit (involving regular words, regular nonwords and words with unpredictable spelling), whereas the fifth graders were prevalently impaired in writing words with unpredictable transcription. The error analysis confirms these results, with third graders producing a high rate of all types of errors (i.e., phonologically plausible, simple and context-sensitive conversion errors), whereas most errors committed by fifth graders were phonologically plausible. Conclusions: Results are coherent with the hypothesis that dyslexic children learning a shallow orthography suffer from delayed acquisition and some fragility of the sub-word level routine, together with a severe and long-lasting deficit of orthographic lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {We studied the reading performance of 340 consecutive, Italian-speaking aphasics in order to evaluate the clinical features of deep dyslexia, the functional impairments underlying semantic paralexias, and their neuranatomical correlates. Semantic paralexias were observed in 9/340 subjects (2.4%). Our data and a review of the literature show that most deep dyslexics suffer from superficial and deep vascular damage in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, and that they are relatively young, well-educated individuals, in the chronic stage of their disease. In these subjects, perisylvian damage might be mainly responsible for damage to sublexical grapheme–phoneme Conversion (GPC) procedures, and extrasylvian damage for lexical–semantic impairment. Semantic paralexias might originate in the right hemisphere, or in left perilesional regions. The functional impairment underlying deep dyslexia was analyzed with specific reference to the summation hypothesis, i.e., to the hypothesis that in reading, GPC procedures interact with lexical–semantic information, thus blocking semantically incorrect responses. On this account, semantic paralexias should only occur when, in the presence of lexical–semantic damage, GPC rules are disrupted to the point that the interaction can no longer take place. In agreement with the hypothesis, only cases with co-occurring lexical–semantic and GPC damage produced semantic paralexias; and, these were the subjects with the most severe GPC damage. The inability to apply approximately 45% GPC mappings is the critical level of sublexical damage that no longer allows GPC procedures to interact with lexical–semantic information.

Abstract = {Patients with degenerative dementia often show language disorders, but little is known about their verbal (VC) and non-verbal communication (NVC). Our aim was to analyse VC and NVC in patients with standard criteria of mild-moderately severe dementia (MMSE ≥ 14/30) resulting from Alzheimer's disease (AD; 29 cases), behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD; 16), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; 13). We used the Lille Communication Test, which addresses three domains: participation in communication (PC: greeting, attention, participation), VC (verbal comprehension, speech outflow, intelligibility, word production, syntax, verbal pragmatics and verbal feedback), and NVC (understanding gestures, affective expressivity, producing gestures, pragmatics and feedback). Patients were compared with 47 matching control subjects. AD patients were partially impaired (p ≤ 0.01) in PC (greeting), and more definitely in VC, especially by verbal comprehension and word finding difficulties and to a much lesser degree in verbal pragmatics (responding to open questions, presenting new information), while NVC was mostly preserved. FTD patients were severely impaired in PC. VC difficulties were related to lexical–semantic, syntactic and more specifically pragmatic problems. NVC was impaired by difficulties in affective expressivity, pragmatics and feedback management. DLB patients showed modest difficulties with VC. PC, VC and NVC strongly correlated with performance in the dementia rating scale. In conclusion, the profile of communication difficulties was quite different between groups. FTD patients showed most severe difficulties in PC and verbal and non-verbal pragmatics, in relation to their frontal lesions. AD patients had prominent impairment of lexical–semantic operations.

WS participants massively opted for the masculine gender as the default one, just as MA-controls did. They differed from CA-controls, however, in that they provided fewer sex-based responses. Splitting the WS group into two subgroups did not reveal a shift to sex-based responses similar to the one found in controls. It is argued that this latter difference could plausibly be related to differences in cognitive, lexical or meta-linguistic abilities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Iconicity is a property that pervades the lexicon of many sign languages, including American Sign Language (ASL). Iconic signs exhibit a motivated, nonarbitrary mapping between the form of the sign and its meaning. We investigated whether iconicity enhances semantic priming effects for ASL and whether iconic signs are recognized more quickly than noniconic signs are (controlling for strength of iconicity, semantic relatedness, familiarity, and imageability). Twenty deaf signers made lexical decisions to the 2nd item of a prime–target pair. Iconic target signs were preceded by prime signs that were (a) iconic and semantically related, (b) noniconic and semantically related, or (c) semantically unrelated. In addition, a set of noniconic target signs was preceded by semantically unrelated primes. Significant facilitation was observed for target signs when they were preceded by semantically related primes. However, iconicity did not increase the priming effect (e.g., the target sign PIANO was primed equally by the iconic sign GUITAR and the noniconic sign MUSIC). In addition, iconic signs were not recognized faster or more accurately than were noniconic signs. These results confirm the existence of semantic priming for sign language and suggest that iconicity does not play a robust role in online lexical processing.

Experiment 2 showed that separating the antibody unit is advantageous in processing certain types of Korean words.

Abstract = {Recent research using word recognition paradigms, such as lexical decision and speeded pronunciation, has investigated how a range of variables affect the location and shape of response time distributions, using both parametric and non-parametric techniques. In this article, we explore the distributional effects of a word frequency manipulation on fixation durations in normal reading, making use of data from two recent eye movement experiments (Drieghe, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2008; White, 2008). The ex-Gaussian distribution provided a good fit to the shape of individual subjects' distributions in both experiments. The frequency manipulation affected both the shift and skew of the distributions, in both experiments, and this conclusion was supported by the nonparametric vincentizing technique. Finally, a new experiment demonstrated that White's (2008) frequency manipulation also affects both shift and skew in response-time distributions in the lexical decision task. These results argue against models of eye movement control in reading that propose that word frequency influences only a subset of fixations and support models in which there is a tight connection between eye movement control and the progress of lexical processing.

Abstract = {Recent work shows that word segmentation is influenced by distal prosodic characteristics of the input several syllables from the segmentation point (Dilley & McAuley, 2008). Here, participants heard eight-syllable sequences with a lexically ambiguous four-syllable ending (e.g., crisis turnip vs. cry sister nip). The prosodic characteristics of the initial five syllables were resynthesized in a manner predicted to favor parsing of the final syllables as either a monosyllabic or a disyllabic word; the acoustic characteristics of the final three syllables were held constant. Experiments 1a–c replicated earlier results showing that utterance-initial prosody influences segmentation utterance-finally, even when lexical content is removed through low-pass filtering, and even when an on-line cross-modal paradigm is used. Experiments 2 and 3 pitted distal prosody against, respectively, distal semantic context and prosodic attributes of the test words themselves. Although these factors jointly affected which words participants heard, distal prosody remained an extremely robust segmentation cue. These findings suggest that distal prosody is a powerful factor for consideration in models of word segmentation and lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We report an individual with Broca’s aphasia (J.H.M.), who exhibited powerful lexical context effects in word production tasks. In an adjective–noun production task (Experiment 1), J.H.M.’s production accuracy decreased as the number of adjectives in the phrase increased (e.g., curly hair vs. long curly hair). In a picture pair naming task (Experiment 2), J.H.M.’s naming accuracy was high, but her naming latencies were abnormally delayed when pairs were semantically related (e.g., goat and pig). This pattern was not observed for older controls. In a computerized Stroop task (Experiment 3), J.H.M.’s naming latencies were abnormally prolonged in the conflict condition, relative to a baseline colour naming task. This effect was far in excess of that for controls. Finally, in a blocked cyclic naming task (Experiment 4), J.H.M.’s accuracy was poorer and her latencies slower when the pictures were semantically related than when they were unrelated, and this effect built up across successive presentation cycles. It was far in excess of that exhibited by older controls. We propose that J.H.M.’s pattern of impairment across these four very different tasks suggests an impairment to a lexical control mechanism, whose normal function is to modulate the flow of activation throughout the lexical network, so as to minimize the competitive effects of nontarget lexical items.

Abstract = {This study attempts to identify strategies peculiar to speakers of non-standard varieties of American English when composing with speech recognition-based dictation software. Two speakers of African American Vernacular English and one non-native speaker of English were asked to orally compose a series of college-level writing tasks using ViaVoice 98.The findings indicate that when the software misrecognized their speech, the language minority students resorted to similar strategies as those of standard American speakers discussed in the literature such as speaker adaptation to recognition systems leading to hyperarticulation and other types of phonetic and lexical adjustments. Moreover, the participants based their strategies on their knowledge of human-to-human interaction (e.g., the sequential organization of talk), which more often than not proved to be useless when interacting with the software. Yet, the students did seem to build up an awareness during the speech sessions of their linguistic variety and its divergence from the standard American accent that the software was originally modeled after.The findings of this study offer a better understanding of some of the strategies that speakers from diverse ethno-linguistic backgrounds may employ when speaking to write with speech recognition-based dictation software. They also offer some insight into users’ assumptions about the capabilities of the system, i.e., what they believed the speech-based software could process in terms of utterance length, tone of voice, canonical pronunciation, and lexical items.

Abstract = {Most words in English have more than one syllable, yet the most influential computational models of reading aloud are restricted to processing monosyllabic words. Here, we present CDP++, a new version of the Connectionist Dual Process model (Perry, Ziegler, & Zorzi, 2007). CDP++ is able to simulate the reading aloud of mono- and disyllabic words and nonwords, and learns to assign stress in exactly the same way as it learns to associate graphemes with phonemes. CDP++ is able to simulate the monosyllabic benchmark effects its predecessor could, and therefore shows full backwards compatibility. CDP++ also accounts for a number of novel effects specific to disyllabic words, including the effects of stress regularity and syllable number. In terms of database performance, CDP++ accounts for over 49% of the reaction time variance on items selected from the English Lexicon Project, a very large database of several thousand of words. With its lexicon of over 32,000 words, CDP++ is therefore a notable example of the successful scaling-up of a connectionist model to a size that more realistically approximates the human lexical system.

Abstract = {Spoken language data were collected from six adult second language (L2) English learners over a year-long period in order to explore the development of word polysemy and frequency use. The data were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. In the first analysis, the growth of WordNet polysemy values and CELEX word frequency values were examined. For both indexes, significant growth was demonstrated from the 2nd to the 16th week of observation, after which values remained stable. Growth in word polysemy values also correlated with changes in word frequency, supporting the notion that frequency and polysemy effects in word use are related. A second analysis used the WordNet dictionary to explore qualitative changes in word sense use concerning six frequent lexical items in the learner corpus (think, know, place, work, play, and name). A qualitative analysis compared normalized frequencies for each word sense in the first trimester of the study to the later trimesters. Differences in the number of word senses used across trimesters were found for all six words. Analyses 1 and 2, taken together, support the notion that L2 learners begin to use words that have the potential for more senses during the first 4 months; learners then begin to extend the core meanings of these polysemous words. These findings provide further insights into the development of lexical proficiency in L2 learners and the growth of lexical networks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {As the popularity of sending messages electronically increases, so does the necessity of conveying messages more efficiently. One way of increasing efficiency is to abbreviate words and expressions by combining letters with numbers such as gr8 for 'great,' using acronyms, such as lol for 'laughing out loud,' or clippings such as msg for 'message.' The present study compares the processing of shortcuts to the processing of closely matched pseudo-shortcuts. ERPs were recorded while participants were performing a lexical decision task. Response times showed that shortcuts were categorized more slowly as nonwords than pseudo-shortcuts. The ERP results showed no differences between shortcuts and pseudo-shortcuts at time windows 50–150 ms and 150–270 ms, but there were significant differences between 270 and 500 ms. These results suggest that at early stages of word recognition, the orthographic and phonological processing is similar for shortcuts and pseudo-shortcuts. However, at the time of lexical access, shortcuts diverge from pseudo-shortcuts, suggesting that shortcuts activate stored lexical representations.

Abstract = {Purpose: To differentiate the effect of phonotactic probability from that of neighborhood density on a vocabulary probe administered to preschool children with or without phonological delays. Method: Twenty preschool children with functional phonological delays and 34 preschool children with typical language development completed a 121-item vocabulary probe in both an expressive and receptive response format. Words on the vocabulary probe orthogonally varied on phonotactic probability and neighborhood density but were matched on age of acquisition, word frequency, word length, semantic set size, concreteness, familiarity, and imagability. Results: Results show a Phonotactic Probability × Neighborhood Density interaction with variation across groups. Specifically, the optimal conditions for typically developing children were rare phonotactic probability with sparse neighborhoods and common phonotactic probability with dense neighborhoods. In contrast, only rare phonotactic probability with sparse neighborhoods was optimal for children with phonological delays. Conclusions: Rare sound sequences and sparse neighborhoods may facilitate triggering of word learning for typically developing children and children with phonological delays. In contrast, common sound sequences and dense neighborhoods may facilitate configuration and engagement for typically developing children but not for children with phonological delays because of their weaker phonological and/or lexical representations.

Abstract = {Purpose: Speech produced by individuals with hypokinetic dysarthria associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by a number of features including impaired speech prosody. The purpose of this study was to investigate intonation contrasts produced by this group of speakers. Method: Speech materials with a question–statement contrast were collected from 14 Cantonese speakers with PD. Twenty listeners then classified the productions as either questions or statements. Acoustic analyses of F0, duration, and intensity were conducted to determine which acoustic cues distinguished the production of questions from statements, and which cues appeared to be exploited by listeners in identifying intonational contrasts. Results: The results show that listeners identified statements with a high degree of accuracy, but the accuracy of question identification ranged from 0.56% to 96% across the 14 speakers. The speakers with PD used similar acoustic cues as nondysarthric Cantonese speakers to mark the question–statement contrast, although the contrasts were not observed in all speakers. Listeners mainly used F0 cues at the final syllable for intonation identification. Conclusion: These data contribute to the researchers’ understanding of intonation marking in speakers with PD, with specific application to the production and perception of intonation in a lexical tone language.

Abstract = {This study investigates the question of whether language background affects the perception of lexical stress in English. Thirty native English speakers and 30 native Chinese learners of English participated in a stressed-syllable identification task and a discrimination task involving three types of stimuli (real words/pseudowords/hums). The results show that both language groups were able to identify and discriminate stress patterns. Lexical and segmental information affected the English and Chinese speakers in varying degrees. English and Chinese speakers showed different response patterns to trochaic vs. iambic stress across the three types of stimuli. An acoustic analysis revealed that two language groups used different acoustic cues to process lexical stress. The findings suggest that the different degrees of lexical and segmental effects can be explained by language background, which in turn supports the hypothesis that language background affects the perception of lexical stress in English.

Abstract = {This study examined effects of lexical status and neighborhood density of constituent syllables on children's nonword repetition and interactions with nonword length. Lexical status of the target syllable impacted repetition accuracy for the longest nonwords. In addition, children made more errors that changed a nonword syllable to a word syllable than the reverse. Syllables from dense versus sparse neighborhoods were repeated more accurately in three- and four-syllable nonwords, but there was no effect of density for two-syllable nonwords. The effect of neighborhood density was greater for a low versus high vocabulary group. Finally, children's error responses were from more dense neighborhoods than the target syllables. The results are congruent with models of nonword repetition that emphasize the influence of long-term lexical knowledge on children's performance.

Abstract = {The cumulative semantic cost describes a phenomenon in which picture naming latencies increase monotonically with each additional within-category item that is named in a sequence of pictures. Here we test whether the cumulative semantic cost requires the assumption of lexical selection by competition. In Experiment 1 participants named a sequence of pictures, while in Experiment 2 participants named words instead of pictures, preceded by a gender marked determiner. We replicate the basic cumulative semantic cost with pictures (Exp. 1) and show that there is no cumulative semantic cost for word targets (Exp. 2). This pattern was replicated in Experiment 3 in which pictures and words were named along with their gender marked definite determiner, and were intermingled within the same experimental design. In addition, Experiment 3 showed that while picture naming induces a cumulative semantic cost for subsequently named words, word naming does not induce a cumulative semantic cost for subsequently named pictures. These findings suggest that the cumulative semantic cost arises prior to lexical selection and that the effect arises due to incremental changes to the connection weights between semantic and lexical representations.

Abstract = {Visual word identification requires readers to code the identity and order of the letters in a word and match this code against previously learned codes. Current models of this lexical matching process posit context-specific letter codes in which letter representations are tied to either specific serial positions or specific local contexts (e.g., letter clusters). The spatial coding model described here adopts a different approach to letter position coding and lexical matching based on context-independent letter representations. In this model, letter position is coded dynamically, with a scheme called spatial coding. Lexical matching is achieved via a method called superposition matching, in which input codes and learned codes are matched on the basis of the relative positions of their common letters. Simulations of the model illustrate its ability to explain a broad range of results from the masked form priming literature, as well as to capture benchmark findings from the unprimed lexical decision task.

One hundred and twelve undergraduate students were given tasks of fast mapping and judgments of learning. A one-way Multivariate Analysis of Variance revealed that participants who performed well on fast mapping had superior global and item-by-item absolute prediction scores compared to poor performers. However, the good and poor performers did not significantly differ in their item-by-item relative predictive accuracy (Goodman–Kruskal gamma correlations) in the immediate as well as the delayed judgments of learning conditions. The possible reasons for inferior gamma correlations, the methodological issues for future research and the clinical implications for the assessment and treatment of adults with lexical deficits are discussed.

Abstract = {The word class effect in the picture-word interference paradigm is a highly influential finding that has provided some of the most compelling support for word class constraints on lexical selection. However, methodological concerns called for a replication of the most convincing of those effects. Experiment 1 was a direct replication of Pechmann and Zerbst (2002; Experiment 4). Participants named pictures of objects in the context of noun and adverb distractors. Naming took place in bare noun and sentence frame contexts. A word class effect emerged in both bare noun and sentence frame naming conditions, suggesting a semantic origin of the effect. In Experiment 2, participants named objects in the context of noun and verb distractors whose word class relationship to the target and imageability were orthogonally manipulated. As before, naming took place in bare noun and sentence frame naming contexts. In both naming contexts, distractor imageability but not word class affected picture naming latencies. These findings confirm the sensitivity of the picture-word interference paradigm to distractor imageability and suggest the paradigm is not sensitive to distractor word class. The results undermine the use of the word class effect in the picture-word interference paradigm as supportive of word class constraints during lexical selection.

Abstract = {In this article, the position of the diverging letter effect has been used to investigate the interactions between lexical and sublexical information during reading acquisition. The position of the diverging letter effect refers to the fact that nonwords derived from words by changing a letter are read more quickly when the diverging letter is toward the end of the string than when it is at the beginning. The position of the diverging letter effect has been explained as a result of the interaction between sublexical procedures, which operate serially, and lexical procedures, which operate in parallel, on the letter string. We demonstrated that the literacy level of the reader determines whether facilitation or interference effects for late diverging nonwords are observed. The oldest children showed the same effect as that shown by the adults. The youngest children showed a reversed pattern; late diverging nonwords were read more slowly and less accurately than early diverging nonwords. We propose that this pattern is due to the combination of (a) the readiness with which lexical information (which increases as literacy increases) is activated and (b) the refining of the mechanism that balances the contributions of the lexical and sublexical procedures.

Abstract = {Precategorical acoustic storage (PAS) is described as a limited capacity buffer store in which acoustic traces are overwritten by successive auditory events. The goal of this study is to extend the function of PAS by investigating whether the recency effect and the suffix effect could also be found when Mandarin lexical tones and emotional tones are recalled in a serial order. Four experiments were conducted. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were asked to recall lexical tones in a serial order. In these experiments, the recency effect and the suffix effect were found. In Experiments 3 and 4, emotional tones were required to be recalled in a serial order. Both effects were also found. The results of our current study suggest that lexical tones and emotional tones are represented independently in PAS, but their representation status is affected by the attributes of suffix. The results also implied that representations of Mandarin pitch patterns were not as stable as segmental fragments, revealing their special status in short-term memory processing. A serial of lexical tones served as experimental stimuli in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 1, 20 undergraduates were required to give immediate serial recall of the lexical tones presented auditorily via speech. In Experiment 2, a suffix was presented at the end of each serial of lexical tones. Another 20 undergraduates were asked to verbally report the serial as soon as the suffix disappeared. In that lexical tones have a close relationship with vowels, four types of suffixes were ¡prepared at the end of each serial and were further compared with the results of Experiment 1. The results of the two experiments indicated that lexical tones, regardless of suffix type, showed a similar recency effect and suffix effect as vowels in serial recall performance. These findings imply a representation in PAS. A serial of emotional tones served as experimental stimuli in Experiments 3 and 4, which aimed to discover whether emotional tones also show the recency effect and the suffix effect, thus represented in PAS as well. The suffix in Experiment 4 was either consistent or inconsistent with the final item's emotional information. The results of Experiment 3 indicated that emotional tones reveal a recency effect in the serial recall task. The results of Experiment 4 were compared with those of Experiment 3, and it was found that emotional tones had the suffix effect only when the emotional information of the suffix was inconsistent with that of the final item. The relationship between the suffix and the final item may be a critical factor that causes the suffix effect. Our results are consistent with the notion that PAS, as a sensory memory system, is a storage that can represent and process various aspects of speech information in a similar way. Further implications of our findings are also discussed in terms of specific attributes of lexical tones and emotional tones. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two fMRI experiments were conducted using song to investigate the domain specificity of linguistic and musical processing. In Experiment 1, participants listened to pairs of spoken words, 'vocalise' (i.e., singing without words), and sung words while performing a same-different task. Results revealed bilateral involvement of middle and superior temporal gyri and inferior and middle frontal gyri while listening to spoken words, sung words and vocalise, although to different degrees. In Experiment 2, participants listened to pairs of sung words that were similar or different in terms of the linguistic and musical dimensions (2 × 2 factorial event-related design) while performing a same-different task. Results showed widespread interactions between the linguistic and musical dimensions of sung words mainly within the network of brain areas identified in Experiment 1. Consequently, the activity in these brain regions cannot be considered as specific to either language or music processing. Taken together, results of both experiments argue against domain specificity and provide additional evidence for a common cerebral network involved in both lexical/phonological and melodic processing.

Abstract = {Background: Theories of comprehension deficits in Broca’s aphasia have largely been based on the pattern of deficit found with movement constructions. However, some studies have found comprehension deficits with binding constructions, which do not involve movement. Aims: This study investigates online processing and offline comprehension of binding constructions, such as reflexive (e.g., himself) and pronoun (e.g., him) constructions in unimpaired and aphasic individuals in an attempt to evaluate theories of agrammatic comprehension. Methods & Procedures: Participants were eight individuals with agrammatic Broca’s aphasia and eight age-matched unimpaired individuals. We used eyetracking to examine online processing of binding constructions while participants listened to stories. Offline comprehension was also tested. Outcomes & Results: The eye movement data showed that individuals with Broca’s aphasia were able to automatically process the correct antecedent of reflexives and pronouns. In addition, their syntactic processing of binding was not delayed compared to normal controls. Nevertheless, offline comprehension of both pronouns and reflexives was significantly impaired compared to the control participants. This comprehension failure was reflected in the aphasic participants’ eye movements at sentence end, where fixations to the competitor increased. Conclusions: These data suggest that comprehension difficulties with binding constructions seen in agrammatic aphasic patients are not due to a deficit in automatic syntactic processing or delayed processing. Rather, they point to a possible deficit in lexical integration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Developmental differences in phonological and orthographic processing in Chinese were examined in 9 year olds, 11 year olds, and adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Rhyming and spelling judgments were made to 2-character words presented sequentially in the visual modality. The spelling task showed greater activation than the rhyming task in right superior parietal lobule and right inferior temporal gyrus, and there were developmental increases across tasks bilaterally in these regions in addition to bilateral occipital cortex, suggesting increased involvement over age on visuo-orthographic analysis. The rhyming task showed greater activation than the spelling task in left superior temporal gyrus and there were developmental decreases across tasks in this region, suggesting reduced involvement over age on phonological representations. The rhyming and spelling tasks included words with conflicting orthographic and phonological information (i.e., rhyming words spelled differently or nonrhyming words spelled similarly) or nonconflicting information. There was a developmental increase in the difference between conflicting and nonconflicting words in left inferior parietal lobule, suggesting greater engagement of systems for mapping between orthographic and phonological representations. Finally, there were developmental increases across tasks in an anterior (Broadman area [BA] 45, 46) and posterior (BA 9) left inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting greater reliance on controlled retrieval and selection of posterior lexical representations.

Abstract = {Recent studies have found that masked word primes that are orthographic neighbors of the target inhibit lexical decision latencies (Davis & Lupker, 2006; Nakayama, Sears, & Lupker, 2008), consistent with the predictions of lexical competition models of visual word identification (e.g., Grainger & Jacobs, 1996). In contrast, using the fast priming paradigm (Sereno & Rayner, 1992), orthographically similar primes produced facilitation in a reading task (H. Lee, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 1999; Y. Lee, Binder, Kim, Pollatsek, & Rayner, 1999). Experiment 1 replicated this facilitation effect using orthographic neighbor primes. In Experiment 2, neighbor primes and targets were presented in different cases (e.g., SIDE–tide); in this situation, the facilitation effect disappeared. However, nonword neighbor primes (e.g., KIDE–tide) still significantly facilitated reading of targets (Experiment 3). Taken together, these results suggest that it is possible to explain the priming effects from word neighbor primes in fast priming experiments in terms of the interactions between the inhibitory and facilitory processes embodied in lexical competition models.

Abstract = {The role of word frequency in lexical access during the production of homophones remains unresolved. In the current study, we address whether specific-word (the frequency of occurrence of the word 'nun') or homophone frequency (the summed frequency of words with the pronunciation /nΛn/) determines the production latencies of homophones. In Experiments 1a, 2a, and 3a, participants named pictures of high-frequency (e.g., 'banco'-a bank: financial institution) and low-frequency (e.g., 'banco'-park bench) Spanish (Experiments 1a and 2a) or French (Experiment 3a) homophones and control pictures of nonhomophone words matched in frequency with each of the two uses of the homophones. The naming latencies for low-frequency homophones were longer than those for high-frequency homophones. Furthermore, the naming latencies for homophones were indistinguishable from those for nonhomophone controls matched in specific-word frequency. In Experiments 1b, 2b, and 3b, the participants performed either object decision or picture-word matching tasks with the stimuli used in the corresponding Experiments 1a, 2a, and 3a. There were no reliable differences between high- and low-frequency homophones. The findings support the hypothesis that specific-word and not homophone frequency determines lexical access in speech production. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This article examines the ways of initiating self-repair in the ongoing turn-constructional unit in conversation. The data come from a wide variety of interactions in Finnish, comprising some 600 instances. In the data, speakers use both non-lexical and lexical devices for marking that they have initiated a self-repair. The initiators focused on are the prosodic cut-off and the particles eiku, tai and siis. Eiku consists of the negation word (ei) and the conjunction/connector ku(n) (‘as’, ‘while’, ‘when’ in its other usages). Tai is used in other contexts as a disjunctive conjunction (‘or’) and siis as a marker of inference (‘so’, ‘then’, ‘therefore’, ‘since’). The devices differ from each other in how explicitly they indicate that a repair is initiated and what kind of repair will follow. As in many other languages, cut-off is the most frequent self-repair initiator in the data: it can initiate any kind of a repair operation. By contrast, eiku projects that the speaker is going to replace or abandon something she has just said. We have not encountered a similar type of particle in other languages. Tai projects that the speaker is going to replace something just said, yet the element replaced may still remain as an alternative. Siis projects that the speaker is going to specify or explain something. There may be languages that almost exclusively deploy prosodic means to index a repair initiation within a turn-constructional unit, whereas other languages, including Finnish also make use of lexical means.

Abstract = {There is increasing experimental evidence that processing action-related language results in the automatic activation of associated regions of the motor and premotor cortex. However, the functional significance of motor activation in language processing is still under debate. In the present EEG study, we set out to investigate if language-induced motor activation primarily reflects the retrieval of lexical-semantic information or post-lexical motor imagery. The processing of action verbs was found accompanied by an early activation of motor-related brain areas, as reflected by a desynchronization in the mu- and beta-frequency bands which was localized to motor and premotor areas. A stronger motor activation was observed for verbs presented in an animal context (e.g. 'The deer jumped over the stream') compared to a human context (e.g. 'The athlete jumped over the fence') and motor resonance was directly modulated by the cloze probability of the noun–verb pairs. The onset of the motor effects preceded classical measures of semantic integration (i.e. the N400 component) and the strength of motor activation was found inversely related to the size of the N400 effect. These findings support the hypothesis that motor activation in language processing primarily supports the retrieval and integration of lexical-semantic information.

Abstract = {This study examined the differences between acoustic characteristics of lexical and emphatic stress patterns of American English in terms of changes in fundamental frequency (F₀), duration, and amplitude of the stress patterns, and identified the most important acoustic characteristics among them. Speech samples were recorded from 13 randomly selected women (M = 23.9 yr., SD = 1.7) who spoke American English as their first language. The speech samples were recorded using Computerized Speech Lab (CSL) Model 4300B with a 16-bit processor at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. Acoustic analyses of the lexical stress and emphatic stress patterns were performed. Statistical analyses showed a significant effect for the stress patterns and F₀, duration, and amplitude; a significant effect for the stress types and F₀, duration, and amplitude; and a significant interaction between the patterns and types. Based on the effect size, it can be concluded that duration appeared to be a more important acoustic character than amplitude or F₀ in differentiating the lexical and emphatic stress patterns.

Abstract = {The ability to acquire new words draws on cognitive, linguistic and social competencies. Assessments of lexical acquisition are often limited to studies using multiple choice comprehension measures in contrived experimental contexts. To address these limitations the current study assessed the ways in which children developed their semantic representations of animal and artefact terms. Children differed in their knowledge of the target terms and experienced different linguistic exposures over a four week period. One hundred and thirty preschool children (mean age = 5;6) were randomly assigned to five conditions (one control and four experimental conditions). For the control and the phonological group, the knowledge children acquired about the target words was assessed at two points, baseline and at a three week follow up. For the remaining experimental groups their understanding of the terms was assessed at five points in time (baseline, 1st week, 2nd week and 3rd week post test). A range of assessment tasks were used to assess lexical knowledge: confrontational naming, multiple choice comprehension measures, sorting, short questions, identification of relations, (association task) definitions and a story generation task. Children’s word knowledge from the different conditions/groups was compared across tasks and time. The analysis focused on the depth and breadth of knowledge that the children acquired for the target words. Independent variables included previous knowledge of the target words, lexical knowledge of other words from the same semantic domain, semantic domain of the target words and type of lexical exposure. There were subtle and complex effects of the different exposure contexts for word learning. Children’s performance was significantly better for items that were partially represented than for the unknown words. Children’s existing vocabulary knowledge for animals was positively correlated with the acquisition of the target words describing animals. However, this was not the case for artefacts. The assessments of word knowledge revealed different aspects of depth in lexical knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The possible-word constraint (PWC; Norris, McQueen, Cutler, & Butterfield, 1997) has been proposed as a language-universal segmentation principle: Lexical candidates are disfavored if the resulting segmentation of continuous speech leads to vowelless residues in the input—for example, single consonants. Three word-spotting experiments investigated segmentation in Slovak, a language with single-consonant words and fixed stress. In Experiment 1, Slovak listeners detected real words such as ruka 'hand' embedded in prepositional-consonant contexts (e.g., /gruka/) faster than those in nonprepositional-consonant contexts (e.g., /truka/) and slowest in syllable contexts (e.g., /dugruka/). The second experiment controlled for effects of stress. Responses were still fastest in prepositional-consonant contexts, but were now slowest in nonprepositional-consonant contexts. In Experiment 3, the lexical and syllabic status of the contexts was manipulated. Responses were again slowest in nonprepositional-consonant contexts but equally fast in prepositional-consonant, prepositional-vowel, and nonprepositional-vowel contexts. These results suggest that Slovak listeners use fixed stress and the PWC to segment speech, but that single consonants that can be words have a special status in Slovak segmentation. Knowledge about what constitutes a phonologically acceptable word in a given language therefore determines whether vowelless stretches of speech are or are not treated as acceptable parts of the lexical parse.

Abstract = {Using cross-modal form priming, we compared the use of stress and lexicality in the segmentation of spoken English by native English speakers (L1) and by native Hungarian speakers of second-language English (L2). For both language groups, lexicality was found to be an effective segmentation cue. That is, spoken disyllabic word fragments were stronger primes in a subsequent visual word recognition task when preceded by meaningful words than when preceded by nonwords: For example, the first two syllables of corridor were a more effective prime for visually presented corridor when heard in the phrase anythingcorri than in imoshingcorri. The stress pattern of the prime (strong-weak vs. weak-strong) did not affect the degree of priming. For L1 speakers, this supports previous findings about the preferential use of high-level segmentation strategies in clear speech. For L2 speakers, the lexical strategy was employed regardless of L2 proficiency level and instead of exploiting the consistent stress pattern of their native language. This is clear evidence for the primacy and robustness of segmentation by lexical subtraction even in individuals whose lexical knowledge is limited.

Abstract = {The present study was designed to investigate effects of complexity and word length of Chinese characters on the decoding ability of elementary students when reading Chinese script. Character complexity was defined by (a) the number of constituent strokes for characters (studied in Experiment 1), and (b) the number of constituent radicals for characters (studied in Experiment 2). The length of word was defined as the number of constituent characters of words (studied in Experiment 3) . Student performance on a lexical recognition task was used as the dependent variable in the three experiments. A total of 124 third grade students, including 45 with low decoding abilities, 42 with average decoding abilities, and 37 with high decoding abilities, participated in the study. It was found that when characters with high frequency were used as stimuli, character complexity defined as the number of constituent strokes of characters, showed a significant interaction effect between complexity and decoding ability. No complexity effect was found when complexity was defined as the number of constituent radicals of characters. Word length, defined as the number of constituent characters of words, showed effects on participants' performance on the lexical recognition task.

The layered structure enables the system to handle the variability of real speech input. Within the model, receptive fields of the pre-lexical layer consist of radial basis functions; the lexical layer is composed of units that perform pattern matching between their internal template and a series of labels, corresponding to the winning receptive fields in the pre-lexical layer. The model adapts through self-tuning of all units, in combination with the formation of a connectivity structure through unsupervised (first layer) and supervised (higher layers) network growth. Simulation studies show that the model can achieve a level of performance in spoken word recognition similar to that of a benchmark approach using hidden Markov models, while enabling parallel access to word candidates in lexical decision making.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by Alfredo Ardila (see record [rid]2010-07255-003[/rid]). Ardila is proposing a new system for classifying aphasic syndromes. This response will consider the benefits of his proposal, particularly with respect to clinical practice. Ardila's system draws a distinction between primary aphasias, where language skills are directly affected, and secondary aphasias, where symptoms arise from impairments outside the language system. An example of the latter is transcortical motor aphasia, which is deemed to be an executive problem affecting language use. The two primary forms of aphasia in Ardila's system are not new at all, but are the highly familiar and long-established Broca's and Wernicke's types. Ardila argues that in these forms of aphasia we see impairments to the fundamental components of language, with Broca's aphasia affecting the grammatical system and Wernicke's aphasia the lexical/semantic system. Ardila argues that in these forms of aphasia we see impairments to the fundamental components of language, with Broca's aphasia affecting the grammatical system and Wernicke's aphasia the lexical/semantic system.

Abstract = {Word retrieval deficits for specific grammatical categories, such as verbs versus nouns, occur as a consequence of brain damage. Such deficits are informative about the nature of lexical organization in the human brain. This study examined retrieval of grammatical categories across three languages in a trilingual person with aphasia who spoke Arabic, French, and English. In order to delineate the nature of word production difficulty, comprehension was tested, and a variety of concomitant lexical–semantic variables were analysed. The patient demonstrated a consistent noun–verb dissociation in picture naming and narrative speech, with severely impaired production of verbs across all three languages. The cross-linguistically similar noun–verb dissociation, coupled with little evidence of semantic impairment, suggests that (a) the patient has a true 'nonsemantic' grammatical category specific deficit, and (b) lexical organization in multilingual speakers shares grammatical class information between languages. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the architecture of lexical organization in bilinguals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The central claim of this paper is that Vantage Theory is able to provide a much-needed explanatory account of the seemingly unrelated differences between lexical and morphological antonyms of dimensional adjectives in Slavic languages. In a case study, I compare two antonyms of the Russian adjective vysokij ‘high’, a morphologically unrelated term nizkij ‘low’ and a morphologically related adjective nevysokij ‘not.high’. I argue that the two terms co-exist because they provide different ways of looking at the lower subscale of vertical size. The distribution exhibited by the adjectives under study is symptomatic of the dominant-recessive pattern of coextension identified by MacLaury in the domain of colour. Two sets of data—a corpus and an elicitation test—provide converging evidence that nizkij ‘low’ names the dominant vantage on the lower subscale: it is more frequent and evenly distributed over referent categories. Nevysokij ‘not.high’ is a recessive term: it is characterised by lower frequency, a rather narrow range of application, and a distribution skewed towards human referents. The findings from this study are compared to the results of earlier research on colour terminology, which raises several methodological questions concerning the application of Vantage Theory to lexical domains other than colour.

This edited book is a tribute to Professor Melissa Bowerman, one of the most prominent scholars in the field of child language acquisition in the last 40 years, who, as I understand, is on the verge of retirement. This book has been prepared with the utmost dedication and care in honor of one of the lights of the field of child language. The ‘Personal Tribute’ sections are interspersed by 11 research chapters. This research consists of four steps: collection of naturalistic data, paying close attention to details, careful weighing of logical arguments for various interpretations, and, finally, the drawing of the widest possible generalizations from the data on processes of child development. The next focus is on cross-linguistic patterning and acquisition of lexical semantics. The book also discuss the cross-linguistic patterning and the theory of events, paths, and causes. In also describe the model of the causal-aspectual structure of events, an important input to future theories of development in the lexical semantic domain.

Abstract = {This study examines lexical differentiation in early trilingual development through an analysis of the translation equivalents (TEs) produced by a Tagalog–Spanish–English trilingual child. The child’s cumulative vocabulary between 1;4 and 2;0 was reconstructed through diary records and audio-recordings, and the extent to which phonetically distinct equivalent doublets and triplets were represented in her cumulative lexicon was examined. The results indicate that TEs were produced from early on, similarly to bilingual children. However, the amount of input heard in each language determined the number and types of equivalents acquired. Also, learning a second TE took less time than learning a first, suggesting that the initial differentiation of the lexicon as evidenced by doublets might facilitate the emergence of multiple lexical systems.

Abstract = {Background: Speech-language pathologists are meeting an increasing number of bilingual clients. This poses a special challenge to clinical practice, given that bilingualism adds to the complexity of aphasia patterns and clinical decisions must be made accordingly. One question that has come to the attention of clinical aphasiologists is that of the language in which therapy should be administered. This issue becomes particularly relevant in cases of involuntary language switching, when choosing between L1 and L2 implies inhibiting one of the languages. Models of lexical selection in bilingual people offer a rationale for language choice based on the specificities of bilingual aphasia within each client. Aims: To provide evidence for model-based intervention in bilingual aphasia, particularly in cases of pathological language switching. Methods & Procedures: This paper reports a model-driven intervention in a case of involuntary language switching following aphasia in a Spanish–English bilingual client. Outcomes & Results: Intervention tailored to the client’s strengths resulted in improved communication skills thanks to the implementation of a self-regulated strategy to overcome involuntary language switching. Conclusions: Model-driven descriptions of bilingual aphasia contribute to efficient intervention by identifying therapy approaches that take account of each client’s language abilities. Further, clinical data analysed within models of bilingual language processing can provide evidence for dissociations between components of the bilingual lexical system.

Abstract = {This paper revisits the effect of lexical ambiguity in word recognition, which has been controversial as previous research reported advantage, disadvantage, and null effects. We discuss factors that were not consistently treated in previous research (e.g., the level of lexical ambiguity investigated, parts of speech of the experimental stimuli, and the choice of non-words) and report on a lexical decision experiment with Chinese nouns in which ambiguous nouns with homonymic and/or metaphorical meanings were contrasted with unambiguous nouns. An ambiguity advantage effect was obtained—Chinese nouns with multiple meanings were recognized faster than those with only one meaning. The results suggested that both homonymic and metaphorical meanings are psychologically salient semantic levels actively represented in the mental lexicon. The results supported a probability-based model of random lexical access with multiple meanings represented by separate semantic nodes. We further discuss these results in terms of lexical semantic representation and how different experimental paradigms result in different ambiguity effects in lexical access.

Abstract = {Based on our previous work, we expected the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) in the left ventral visual pathway to be engaged by both whole-word recognition and by serial sublexical coding of letter strings. To examine this double function, a phonological lexical decision task (i.e., 'Does xxx sound like an existing word?') presented short and long letter strings of words, pseudohomophones, and pseudowords (e.g., Taxi, Taksi and Tazi). Main findings were that the length effect for words was limited to occipital regions and absent in the VWFA. In contrast, a marked length effect for pseudowords was found throughout the ventral visual pathway including the VWFA, as well as in regions presumably engaged by visual attention and silent-articulatory processes. The length by lexicality interaction on brain activation corresponds to well-established behavioral findings of a length by lexicality interaction on naming latencies and speaks for the engagement of the VWFA by both lexical and sublexical processes.

Abstract = {Words denoting manipulable objects activate sensorimotor brain areas, likely reflecting action experience with the denoted objects. In particular, these sensorimotor lexical representations have been found to reflect the way in which an object is used. In the current paper we present data from two experiments (one behavioral and one neuroimaging) in which we investigate whether body schema information, putatively necessary for interacting with functional objects, is also recruited during lexical processing. To this end, we presented participants with words denoting objects that are typically brought towards or away from the body (e.g., cup or key, respectively). We hypothesized that objects typically brought to a location on the body (e.g., cup) are relatively more reliant on body schema representations, since the final goal location of the cup (i.e., the mouth) is represented primarily through posture and body co-ordinates. In contrast, objects typically brought to a location away from the body (e.g., key) are relatively more dependent on visuo-spatial representations, since the final goal location of the key (i.e., a keyhole) is perceived visually. The behavioral study showed that prior planning of a movement along an axis towards and away from the body facilitates processing of words with a congruent action semantic feature (i.e., preparation of movement towards the body facilitates processing of cup.). In an fMRI study we showed that words denoting objects brought towards the body engage the resources of brain areas involved in the processing information about human bodies (i.e., the extra-striate body area, middle occipital gyrus and inferior parietal lobe) relatively more than words denoting objects typically brought away from the body. The results provide converging evidence that body schema are implicitly activated in processing lexical information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {At present, there is no comprehensive psycholinguistic database containing Swedish words with ratings of word properties such as e.g. imageability, although researchers carrying out psycholinguistic studies in Swedish face the need to be able to control for and systematically vary such properties. The present study addressed this issue by investigating the possibility of transferring English word ratings to Swedish. Imageability, familiarity and age of acquisition (AoA) ratings were obtained for a sample of Swedish words (N = 99). These ratings were then compared with the corresponding English ratings from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart 1981) using Spearman correlation. Swedish and English word ratings were found to be highly correlated for imageability and AoA, and moderately correlated for familiarity. Following these results, we suggest that, in general, ratings of these variables can be reliably transferred between the two languages, althou)},

Abstract = {The results of three projects concerned with auditory word recognition and the structure of the lexicon are reported in this paper. The first project described was designed to test experimentally several specific predictions derived from MACS, a simulation model of the Cohort Theory of word recognition. The second project description provides the results of analyses of the structure and distribution of words in the lexicon using a large lexical database. In this discussion, statistics about similarity spaces for high and low frequency words are applied to previously published data on the intelligibility of words presented in noise, and differences in identification are shown to be related to structural factors about the specific words and the distribution of similar words in  their neighborhoods. Finally, the third project description reports efforts at developing a new theory of word recognition known as the Phonetic Refinement Theory, which was designed to incorporate some of the detailed acoustic-phonetic and phonotactic knowledge that listeners have about the internal structure of words and the organization of words in the lexicon, and about how they use this knowledge in word recognition.

Abstract = {Silent-letter endings are often claimed to be a major source of inconsistency in the French orthography. In this report, we introduce Silex, a database designed to facilitate the study of spelling performance in general, and silent-letter endings in particular. It was derived from two large and recent corpora based on child- and adult-targeted material. Silex consists of three kinds of Excel workbooks: a set of Stimuli Selector workbooks that allow researchers to select words based on a variety of statistics and word characteristics; a Table Generator workbook that allows researchers to build consistency distribution tables by selecting specific phonological or orthographic units; and a Master File workbook, from which all statistics were derived, and that allows researchers to compute other statistics. Silex is different from existing databases in the manner that silent-letter endings were coded and how consistency indices were computed. Importantly, Silex provides unconditional- and conditional-consistency indices for silent-letter endings. To demonstrate the utility of Silex, we first described the silent-letter phenomenon in French. We found that, at minimum, 28 % of French words end with a silent letter. Moreover, silent-letter endings are usually t, e, s, x, or d, and the occurrence of these letters is conditioned by the phonological ending of words. Second, we showed how Silex could prove useful for the development of theoretical models and for empirical studies. The novel information provided in Silex as well as the flexibility of this database should enable researchers to advance our understanding of developing and skilled spelling performance.

These methods can produce incomplete or irrelevant results due to the use of synonyms and polysemus words. The association of terms with documents (or implicit semantic structure) can be derived using large sparse term-by-document matrices. In fact, both terms and documents can be matched with user queries using representations in k-space (where 100 ≤ k ≤ 200) derived from k of the largest approximate singular vectors of these term-by-document matrices. This completely automated approach called latent semantic indexing or LSI, uses subspaces spanned by the approximate singular vectors to encode important associative relationships between terms and documents in k-space. Using LSI, two or more documents may be close to each other in k-space (and hence meaning) yet share no common terms. The focus of this work is to demo)},

Abstract = {In two experiments, one hundred ninety-two 3-year-olds, 4-year-olds, and adults heard a novel word for a target object and then were asked to extend the label to one of two test objects, one matching in shape-based object category (the shape match) and the other matching in a property other than shape (the property match). We independently manipulated the lexical form class cues (count noun, adjective) and social-pragmatic cues (point actions, property-highlighting actions) accompanying the label. The impact of these two types of cue on extension differed markedly across age groups. Adults and 4-year-olds extended the word to the property match significantly more often when the term was modeled as an adjective and when it was presented with property-highlighting actions; but adults extended both adjectives and count nouns systematically to the property match when the speaker highlighted the non-shape property, whereas 4-year-olds systematically extended only adjectives to the property match under these conditions. Three-year-olds extended the word to the property match significantly more often when the label was modeled as an adjective but were not significantly affected by the social-pragmatic cues; and they failed to extend either adjectives or count nouns systematically to the property match when the speaker highlighted the non-shape property. We discuss the results in terms of the proposal that word learning draws on cues from multiple sources and the nature of the ‘‘shape bias’’ in lexical development.

The Development of Language (6th edition) is a comprehensive textbook covering the key areas of research in the field. The main focus of the text is the development of language in young children; however, the book also includes research on issues pertaining to language and ageing. Thus the book presents a global, theory-neutral approach to the area of language development, and in doing so provides an excellent introduction to the field. The book by Owens is made up of fourteen chapters plus a helpful glossary of terms and two appendices—one on American English speech sounds and the other containing a basic developmental schedule from birth to twelve years. The book by O'Grady includes seven chapters covering the main aspects of speech perception and production, and lexical, morphological and syntactic acquisition.

Abstract = {In one of Bill Waterson's hilarious 'Calvin and Hobbes' cartoons, Calvin is standing in the garden with a big can of water. The plants in the garden are on the verge of wilting and with an evil grin on his face, Calvin proudly exclaims that it is up to him to decide if they get water or not. He keeps on shouting that their very lives are in his hands and that he controls their fate. Calvin's aspirations of absolute power are short-lived, however. In the next frame, we can see a very disappointed Calvin standing in the middle of a sudden rain shower that is providing the victorious plants with all the water they could ever dream of. This cartoon is decorating my office door. It is a superb illustration of a classic reasoning fallacy. Calvin knows that if you water plants, they stay healthy. Based on this conditional (e.g., 'if, then') knowledge he infers that if he doesn't water the plants, it follows that they will die. In logic, this inference is known as the Denial of the Antecedent fallacy (DA). A conditional links a specific precondition or cause (e.g., you water the plants) with a specific consequence or effect (e.g., the plants stay healthy). Logically speaking, a conditional utterance implies that if the precondition is met, the effect should always follow. However, this does not mean that if the precondition is not met, the effect cannot occur. There might be other conditions that can result in the occurrence of the effect (e.g., 'it might rain'). Most adults will spontaneously think of such alternative causes and this will help them to avoid Calvin's fallacious reasoning (and utter disappointment). Over the last two decades it has been argued that the search for such alternatives (or 'counterexamples') lies at the core of the conditional reasoning process. It is assumed that when faced with a conditional, people will spontaneously search their semantic memory for stored alternative causes. Retrieval of such alternatives helps people to reject invalid inferences such as the above illustrated DA or related Affirmation of the Consequent (AC) fallacy. This chapter includes an experimental study to determine if logistic views are right and people do not retrieve counterexamples (stored alternative causes) during reasoning. If this is the case, then we should not observe any facilitation or distortion effects in the subsequent lexical decision task. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The study analyzed text-embedded lexical usage as diagnostic of writing-speech-distinctions in stories and discussions produced in the two modalities by English- speaking grade-school children, middle-school pre-adolescents, high-school adolescents, and adults. We assumed that (1) while children master writing as a notational system by age 9 to 10 years, command of written language as a special style of discourse has a long developmental trajectory, and (2) distinct processing constraints and communicative circumstances combine to affect texts produced in the two modalities. Across the board, written texts scored higher than their spoken counterparts produced by the same participants on all five measures that we applied—Word Length, Register, Density, Diversity, and Abstractness—reflecting a more elevated and carefully monitored style of expression. With regard to development, high school students emerged as distinct from the two younger groups, demonstrating adolescence as a developmental watershed in discourse-embedded lexical usage as in other domains of text construction. When task order (written texts produced before or after spoken ones, respectively) is taken into account, however, a more complex, multi-faceted picture emerges with respect to the variables of age, specific lexical measure, and order effects.

Abstract = {Cross-linguistic research on the development of tense-aspect marking has revealed a strong effect of lexical aspect. But the degree of this effect varies across languages. Explanation for this universal tendency and language-specific variation is still an open issue. This study investigates the early emergence and subsequent development of four grammatical aspect markers in Mandarin, -le (perfective), zai (progressive), -zhe (durative), and -guo (experiential), in the longitudinal speech data of four children acquiring Mandarin Chinese. It was found that the emergence of grammatical aspect marking generally follows the predictions of the aspect hypothesis, perfective -le predominantly appearing with telic verbs, whereas progressive zai is almost exclusively used with activity verbs. However, the typological features of Mandarin also affect the early uses of -le, which is used with stative predicates more frequently than predicted, and the input patterns play an important role in children's aspect marking. The results support a usage-based learning process in accord with a language-specific system of aspectual semantics, rather than a strong universal association of grammatical aspect and lexical aspect.

Abstract = {In the same-different match task, masked priming is observed with the same responses but not different responses. Norris and Kinoshita's (2008) Bayesian reader account of masked priming explains this pattern based on the same principle as that explaining the absence of priming for nonwords in the lexical decision task. The pattern of priming follows from the way the model makes optimal decisions in the two tasks; priming does not depend on first activating the prime and then the target. An alternative explanation is in terms of a bias towards responding 'same' that exactly counters the facilitatory effect of lexical access. The present study tested these two views by varying both the degree to which the prime predicts the response and the visibility of the prime. Unmasked primes produced effects expected from the view that priming is influenced by the degree to which the prime predicts the response. In contrast, with masked primes, the size of priming for the same response was completely unaffected by predictability. These results rule out response bias as an explanation of the absence of masked priming for different responses and, in turn, indicate that masked priming is not a consequence of automatic lexical access of the prime.

Abstract = {Whether words are or are not activated within the lexicon of the nonused language is an important question for accounts of bilingual word production. Prior studies have not led to conclusive results, either because alternative accounts could be proposed for their findings or because activation could have been artificially induced by the experimental paradigms. Moreover, previous data only involved target translations, and nothing is known about the activation of nontarget words in the nonused language. The picture–picture interference paradigm was used here, since it allowed the activation of nontarget words to be determined without showing stimuli that could artificially activate the nonused language. Proficient Spanish–Catalan speakers were presented with pairs of partially overlapping colored pictures and were instructed to name the green picture and ignore the red picture. In Experiment 1, distractor pictures with cognate names interfered more than distractor pictures with noncognate names. In Experiment 2, facilitation was observed when the names of the distractor pictures in the nonused language were phonologically related to the names of the target pictures. Overall, these results indicate that nontarget words are activated in the nonused language, at least in the case of proficient bilingual speakers. These results help researchers to constrain theories of bilingual lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Adults refer young children's attention to things in two basic ways: through the use of pointing (and other deictic gestures) and words (and other linguistic conventions). In the current studies, we referred young children (2- and 4-year-olds) to things in conflicting ways, that is, by pointing to one object while indicating linguistically (in some way) a different object. In Study 1, a novel word was put into competition with a pointing gesture in a mutual exclusivity paradigm; that is, with a known and a novel object in front of the child, the adult pointed to the known object (e.g. a cup) while simultaneously requesting 'the modi'. In contrast to the findings of Jaswal and Hansen (2006), children followed almost exclusively the pointing gesture. In Study 2, when a known word was put into competition with a pointing gesture—the adult pointed to the novel object but requested 'the car'—children still followed the pointing gesture. In Study 3, the referent of the pointing gesture was doubly contradicted by the lexical information—the adult pointed to a known object (e.g. a cup) but requested 'the car'—in which case children considered pointing and lexical information equally strong. Together, these findings suggest that in disambiguating acts of reference, young children at both 2 and 4 years of age rely most heavily on pragmatic information (e.g. in a pointing gesture), and only secondarily on lexical conventions and principles.

Abstract = {In a prior study (Newman & Bernstein Ratner, 2007), we examined the effects of word frequency and phonological neighborhood characteristics on confrontation naming latency, accuracy and fluency in adults who stutter and typically fluent speakers. A small difference in accuracy favoring fluent adults was noted, but no other patterns differentiated fluent speaker responses from those obtained from the adults who stutter. Because lexical organization or retrieval differences might be more easily observed in less mature language users, we replicated the experiment using 15 children who stutter (ages 4;10 16;2) and age- and gender-matched peers. Results replicated the earlier study: the two groups of participants showed strikingly similar patterns of responses based on word frequency and neighborhood characteristics. There were also no differences in naming accuracy overall between the two groups. Given our results and those of other researchers who have explored the impact of neighborhood variables on lexical retrieval in people who stutter, we suggest that differences between language production in PWS and fluent speakers are not likely to involve atypical phonological organization of lexical neighborhoods.

Abstract = {The electrophysiological response to words during the ‘N400’ time window (∼300–500ms post-onset) is affected by the context in which the word is presented, but whether this effect reflects the impact of context on access of the stored lexical information itself or, alternatively, post-access integration processes is still an open question with substantive theoretical consequences. One challenge for integration accounts is that contexts that seem to require different levels of integration for incoming words (i.e., sentence frames vs. prime words) have similar effects on the N400 component measured in ERP. In this study we compare the effects of these different context types directly, in a within-subject design using MEG, which provides a better opportunity for identifying topographical differences between electrophysiological components, due to the minimal spatial distortion of the MEG signal. We find a qualitatively similar contextual effect for both sentence frame and prime-word contexts, although the effect is smaller in magnitude for shorter word prime contexts. Additionally, we observe no difference in response amplitude between sentence endings that are explicitly incongruent and target words that are simply part of an unrelated pair. These results suggest that the N400 effect does not reflect semantic integration difficulty. Rather, the data are consistent with an account in which N400 reduction reflects facilitated access of lexical information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Sentences with embedding are more complex than sentences without embedding, because they contain more syntactic layers in their phrasal architecture. Until now, neuroimaging studies tested embedded sentences that also included syntactic movement. To explore which cortical areas are specifically involved in the processing of syntactic layers, we used embedded sentences that did not include syntactic movement. We compared sentences in which the verb was complemented with an embedded sentence (CP complement) to sentences with noun phrase (NP) complements. The comparison of sentences with and without embedding revealed activations in the left IFG, bilateral temporo-parietal cortices, bilateral MTG, and precuneus. We further examined the effect of embedding at the lexical level. For this, we tested whether verbs that can select CP complements, namely, whose lexical entry includes a CP option, are more complex than verbs that do not select CP complements, even when both verb types appeared in sentences without embedding. The comparison of verbs that can take CP complements with verbs that can take NP complements, when these verbs appeared with prepositional phrase complements, revealed activations in bilateral anterior MTG and precuneus, showing that embedding also affects processing at the lexical level. The results thus show that sentential embedding, even without syntactic movement, loads onto several cortical resources including the left IFG, indicating that the generation of syntactic layers is cognitively costly, and that embedding affects processing at both the sentence and the lexical levels.

Abstract = {By age 1, infants display remarkable sensitivity to the sound structure of their native language. Statistical learning, the process of detecting structure in the environment by tracking patterns in the input, is hypothesized to contribute to infants early learning about sound. The present paper explores how infants ability to track distributional information in the speech signal contributes to a fundamental aspect of language development, linking sounds with meanings in word learning. Previous research has demonstrated that infants detect several cues that mark where words begin and end in the fluent stream of speech (e.g., transitional probability, phonotactic regularities). Tracking such patterns may allow infants to isolate individual words, making them available to be associated with referents. Even very early in vocabulary development, statistical learning about which sound sequences are likely or unlikely to occur within words in the native language may also shape word learning. We propose that early experience with sound sequence regularities provides infants with a foundation for lexical acquisition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Languages such as Swedish use suprasegmental information such as tone, over and above segments, to mark lexical contrast. Theories differ with respect to the abstractness and specification of tone in the mental lexicon. In a forced choice task, we tested Swedish listeners’ responses to words with segmentally identical first syllables differing in tonal contours (characterized as Accents 1 and 2). We assumed Accent 1 to be lexically specified for a subset of words and hypothesized that this specification would speed up word accent identification. As was predicted, listeners were fastest in choosing the tonally correct word when the accent was lexically specified. We conclude that the processing of surface tonal contours is governed by their underlying lexical structure with tonal specification. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Word production is a complex multistage process linking conceptual representations, lexical entries, phonological forms and articulation. Previous studies have revealed a network of predominantly left-lateralized brain regions supporting this process, but many details regarding the precise functions of different nodes in this network remain unclear. To better delineate the functions of regions involved in word production, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify brain areas where blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to overt picture naming were modulated by three psycholinguistic variables: concept familiarity, word frequency, and word length, and one behavioral variable: reaction time. Each of these variables has been suggested by prior studies to be associated with different aspects of word production. Processing of less familiar concepts was associated with greater BOLD responses in bilateral occipitotemporal regions, reflecting visual processing and conceptual preparation. Lower frequency words produced greater BOLD signal in left inferior temporal cortex and the left temporoparietal junction, suggesting involvement of these regions in lexical selection and retrieval and encoding of phonological codes. Word length was positively correlated with signal intensity in Heschl's gyrus bilaterally, extending into the mid-superior temporal gyrus (STG) and sulcus (STS) in the left hemisphere. The left mid-STS site was also modulated by reaction time, suggesting a role in the storage of lexical phonological codes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In three experiments, hearing 7- and 8-year-olds, hearing 11- and 12-year-olds, and deaf 11- and 12-year-olds read a prenominal structure (e.g., the blue ball), a relative clause structure (e.g., the ball that is blue), or a main clause (e.g., the ball is blue). After reading each prime structure, children described a target picture in writing. Half of the target pictures contained the same noun as the prime structure and half contained a different noun. Hearing 7- and 8-year-olds and 11- and 12-year-olds, as well as deaf 11- and 12-year-olds, showed priming effects for all three structures in both the same-noun and different-noun conditions. Structural priming was not boosted by lexical repetition in the hearing and deaf 11- and 12-year-olds; a lexical boost effect was observed only in the 7- and 8-year-olds and only in the relative clause structure. The findings suggest that hearing and deaf children possess abstract representations of adjective–noun structures independent of particular lexical items.

Abstract = {Word finding difficulties are often reported by epileptic patients with seizures originating from the language dominant cerebral hemisphere, for example, in temporal lobe epilepsy. Evidence regarding the brain regions underlying this deficit comes from studies of peri-operative electro-cortical stimulation, as well as post-surgical performance. This evidence has highlighted a role for the anterior part of the dominant temporal lobe in oral word production. These conclusions contrast with findings from activation studies involving healthy speakers or acute ischaemic stroke patients, where the region most directly related to word retrieval appears to be the posterior part of the left temporal lobe. To clarify the neural basis of word retrieval in temporal lobe epilepsy, we tested forty-three drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients (28 left, 15 right). Comprehensive neuropsychological and language assessments were performed. Single spoken word production was elicited with picture or definition stimuli. Detailed analysis allowed the distinction of impaired word retrieval from other possible causes of naming failure. Finally, the neural substrate of the deficit was assessed by correlating word retrieval performance and resting-state brain metabolism in 18 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-Positron Emission Tomography. Naming difficulties often resulted from genuine word retrieval failures (anomic states), both in picture and in definition tasks. Left temporal lobe epilepsy patients showed considerably worse performance than right temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Performance was poorer in the definition than in the picture task. Across patients and the left temporal lobe epilepsy subgroup, frequency of anomic state was negatively correlated with resting-state brain metabolism in left posterior and basal temporal regions (Brodmann’s area 20-37-39). These results show the involvement of posterior temporal regions, within a larger antero-posterior-basal temporal network, in the specific process of word retrieval in temporal lobe epilepsy. A tentative explanation for these findings is that epilepsy induces functional deafferentation between anterior temporal structures devoted to semantic processing and neocortical posterior temporal structures devoted to lexical processing.

Abstract = {Participants’ eye movements were monitored while they read sentences containing biased homographs in either a single-meaning context condition that instantiated the subordinate meaning of the homograph without ruling out the dominant meaning (e.g., 'The man with a toothache had a crown made by the best dentist in town') or a dual-meaning pun context condition that supported both the subordinate and dominant meanings (e.g., 'The king with a toothache had a crown made by the best dentist in town'). In both of these conditions, the homographs were followed by disambiguating material that supported the subordinate meaning and ruled out the dominant meaning. Fixation times on the homograph were longer in the single-meaning condition than in the dual-meaning condition, whereas the reverse pattern was demonstrated for fixation times on the disambiguating region; these effects were observed as early as first-fixation duration. The findings strongly support the reordered access model of lexical ambiguity resolution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two related questions critical to understanding the predictive processes that come online during sentence comprehension are (1) what information is included in the representation created through prediction and (2) at what functional stage does top-down, predicted information begin to affect bottom-up word processing? We investigated these questions by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) as participants read sentences that ended with expected words or with unexpected items (words, pseudowords, or illegal strings) that were either orthographically unrelated to the expected word or were one of its orthographic neighbors. The data show that, regardless of lexical status, attempts at semantic access (N400) for orthographic neighbors of expected words are facilitated relative to the processing of orthographically unrelated items. Our findings support a view of sentence processing wherein orthographically organized information is brought online by prediction and interacts with input prior to any filter on lexical status.

Abstract = {The nature of the comorbidity between Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Reading Disability (RD) was examined using a double dissociation design. Children were between 8 and 12 years of age and entered into four groups: ADHD only (n=24), ADHD +RD (n=29), RD only (n=41) and normal controls (n= 26). In total, 120 children participated in the study; 38 girls and 82 boys. Both ADHD and RD were associated with impairments in inhibition and lexical decision, although inhibition and lexical decision were more severely impaired in RD than in ADHD. Visuospatial working memory deficits were specific to children with only ADHD. It is concluded that there was overlap on lexical decision and to a lesser extent on inhibition between ADHD and RD. In ADHD, impairments were dependent on IQ, which suggest that the overlap in lexical decision and inhibition is different in origin for ADHD and RD. The ADHD only group was specifically characterized by deficits in visuospatial working memory. Hence, no double dissociation between ADHD and RD was found on executive functioning and lexical decision. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study examined a hypothesis discussed in Bi, Han, Weekes, and Shu (2007) of a non-lexical system consisting of correspondence rules between character subcomponents and phonology in reading Chinese. It contrasts with the lexical view stating that reading aloud must be lexically mediated as assumed in all current models of character naming. To contrast these accounts, we asked two Cantonese brain-injured anomic individuals with largely preserved reading abilities to read aloud non-existing phonetic compounds containing a free-standing or a non-free-standing phonetic radical. The lexical view predicts that both subjects should be able to provide plausible responses to pseudo-characters, whereas such a prediction is not made by the non-lexical account. We found that both participants could produce legitimate responses to pseudo-characters, similar to the normal individuals. Furthermore, their responses to complex pseudo-characters were strongly influenced by the presence of free-standing phonetic radicals, lending further support to the lexical view.

Abstract = {The emergence of grammar in relation to lexical growth was analyzed in a sample of Finnish children ( N = 181) at 2;0. The Finnish version of the Communicative Development Inventory was used to gather information on both language domains. The onset of grammar occurred in close association with vocabulary growth. The acquisition of the nominal and verbal inflections of Finnish differed when analyzed in relation to the lexicon in which they are used: the strongest growth in the acquisition of case form types occurred when the nominal lexicon size was roughly between 50 and 250 words, whereas verb inflectional types were acquired actively from the beginning of the verb lexicon acquisition. The findings extend the previous findings of the close association between lexicon and grammar (e.g. Bates & Goodman, 1999). The results suggest that different grammatical structures display different degrees and types of lexical dependency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The main purpose of the present study was to identify specific temperamental profiles associated to different levels of linguistic competence and to identify the profile associated with the highest risk for language acquisition. A sample of 118 children aged 28 months were evaluated by their day-care centre teachers who compiled two questionnaires: Il Primo Vocabokrio del Bambino (Caselli, Casadio, 1995) and Questionari Italiani del Temperamento (Axia, 2002). Three groups of children with different temperamental profiles emerged: (1) a group with a typical profile of the Italian population; (2) a group made up of easily distractible and not very persistent children, who show a poor capacity to modulate motor activity; (3) children showing inhibition in new situations and intense negative emotional reactions. Comparing the three groups on the basis of their level of linguistic competence significant differences emerged with reference to certain indices such as vocabulary size and composition: more specifically, the group of inattentive children exhibited a more 'immature' vocabulary, characterised by the presence of more primitive components of the lexical repertory.

Abstract = {The role of the prefrontal Cortex (PFC) in higher cognitive functions—including working memory, conflict resolution, set shifting and semantic processing—has been demonstrated unequivocally. Despite the great heterogeneity among tasks measuring these phenotypes, due in part to the different cognitive sub-processes implied and the specifi city of the stimulus material used, there is agreement that all of these tasks recruit an executive control system located in the PFC. On a biochemical level it is known that the dopaminergic system plays an important role in executive control functions. Evidence comes from molecular genetics relating the functional COMT Val158Met polymorphism to working memory and set shifting. In order determine whether this pattern of findings generalises to linguistic and semantic processing, we investigated the effects of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism in lexical decision making using masked and unmasked versions of the semantic priming paradigm on N = 104 healthy subjects. Although we observed strong priming effects in all conditions (masked priming, unmasked priming with short/long stimulus asynchronies (SOAs), direct and indirect priming), COMT was not significantly related to priming, suggesting no reliable influence on semantic processing. However, COMT Val158Met was strongly associated with lexical decision latencies in all priming conditions if considered separately, explaining between 9 and 14.5% of the variance. Therefore, the findings indicate that COMT mainly influences more general executive control functions in the PFC supporting the speed of lexical decisions.

Abstract = {The picture–word interference (PWI) task is a widely used technique for exploring effects of semantic context on lexical access. In this task, printed words are superimposed over pictures to be named, with the timing of the interfering word relative to the picture systematically manipulated. Two experiments (N = 24 adults in each) explored the time course of effects of associates (e.g., CARROT superimposed on a picture of a rabbit) versus coordinates (e.g., CHIPMUNK superimposed on a picture of a rabbit) on naming latencies. Associates led to faster picture naming than did unrelated words, with facilitative effects occurring at stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs, in ms) ranging from –450 to 0. Coordinates led to slower naming latencies, with the interference effect restricted to SOAs of –150 and 0. The overlapping time course of associative priming and coordinate interference provides important constraints on models of lexical access in speech production.

Abstract = {Previous research using the name-based categorization task has shown that 20-month-old infants can simultaneously learn 2 words that only differ by 1 consonantal feature but fail to do so when the words only differ by 1 vocalic feature. This asymmetry was taken as evidence for the proposal that consonants are more important than vowels at the lexical level. This study explores this consonant–vowel asymmetry in 16-month-old infants, using an interactive word learning task. It shows that the pattern of the 16-month-olds is the same as that of the 20-month-olds. Infants succeeded with 1-feature consonantal contrasts (either place or voicing) but were at chance level with 1-feature vocalic contrasts (either place or height). These results thus contribute to a growing body of evidence establishing, from early infancy to adulthood, that consonants and vowels have different roles in lexical acquisition and processing.

Abstract = {Previous research using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) suggested that phonological processing in visual word recognition occurs rather late, typically after semantic or syntactic processing. Here, we show that phonological activation in visual word recognition can be observed much earlier. Using a lexical decision task, we show that ERPs to pseudohomophones (PsHs) (e.g., ROZE) differed from well-matched spelling controls (e.g., ROFE) as early as 150 ms (P150) after stimulus onset. The PsH effect occurred as early as the word frequency effect suggesting that phonological activation occurs early enough to influence lexical access. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA) revealed that left temporoparietal and right frontotemporal areas are the likely brain regions associated with the processing of phonological information at the lexical level. Altogether, the results show that phonological processes are activated early in visual word recognition and play an important role in lexical access.

Ten adults with a history of Language Impairment and 30 control participants were asked to write the story of Cinderella. Stories were analyzed for their generic structure and cohesion resources, both of which contribute to the organization and coherence of a text. Results revealed that patterns of text organization at the level of generic structure and measures of cohesion did not distinguish the performance of writers with a history of Language Impairment from the comparison group. A wide range of lexico-grammatical skills was evident within the Language Impaired group, with few individuals with Language Impairment falling outside the normal range of performance. It is suggested that generic structure and cohesion are a relative strength in the writing of adults with Language Impairment, within the constraints of their lexical and grammatical skills.

Abstract = {This experiment examined the item-level relationship between 7-year-olds’ ability to read words aloud and their knowledge of the same words in the oral domain. Two types of knowledge were contrasted: familiarity with the phonological form of the word (lexical phonology), measured by auditory lexical decision, and semantic knowledge, measured by a definitions task. Overall, there was a robust relationship between word knowledge and reading aloud success. The association was stronger when words contained irregular spelling–sound correspondences. There was no evidence that a deeper or more semantic knowledge of words was more closely related to reading aloud success beyond the association between reading success and familiarity with the phonological form of the same words. This finding is not compatible with models that see semantics as contributing directly to the reading aloud process, at least during the relatively early stages of reading development. More critical was whether or not a word was considered a lexical item, as indexed by auditory lexical decision performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {According to the lexical approach to personality, psychological adjectives used in everyday language (e.g., 'extraverted') are a valid basis for describing the psychological properties that can be measured using personality inventories. In the present contribution, both the foundations and the consequences of this approach are subjected to a critical analysis, which comes to the conclusion that it is based on a mistaken conception of psychological terms and a questionable assumption as to the purpose of personality inventories. A fresh method is therefore put forward, defending a polysemous approach to psychological terms, partly inspired by Wittgenstein's second philosophy (1953). This approach stresses the fact that every adjective encompasses different meanings (i.e., no adjective can be summed up by a single essential meaning); and one of these meanings may become dominant, to the detriment of the others, according to the forms of life (i.e., social and linguistic practices) in which people are objectively involved. The need to link the definition of adjectives to peoples' concrete forms of life paves the way for a new and radically different program of research from that constructed within the framework of the lexical hypothesis.

Abstract = {The study examines prosodic characteristics of Hebrew speech directed to children between 0;9-3;0 years, based on longitudinal samples of 228,946 tokens (8,075 types). The distribution of prosodic patterns—the number of syllables and stress patterns—is analyzed across three lexical categories, distinguishing not only between open-and closed-class items, but also between these two categories and a third, innovative, class, referred to as between-class items. Results indicate that Hebrew CDS consists mainly of mono- and bisyllabic words, with differences between lexical categories; and that the most common stress pattern is word-final, with parallel distributions found for all categories. Additional analyses showed that verbs take word-final stress, but nouns are both trochaic and iambic. Finally, a developmental analysis indicates a significant increase in the number of iambic words in CDS. These findings have clear implications regarding the use of prosody for word segmentation and assignment of lexical class in infancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study investigated the role of auditory selective attention capacities as a possible mediator of the well-established association between verbal short-term memory (STM) and vocabulary development. A total of 47 6- and 7-year-olds were administered verbal immediate serial recall and auditory attention tasks. Both task types probed processing of item and serial order information because recent studies have shown this distinction to be critical when exploring relations between STM and lexical development. Multiple regression and variance partitioning analyses highlighted two variables as determinants of vocabulary development: (a) a serial order processing variable shared by STM order recall and a selective attention task for sequence information and (b) an attentional variable shared by selective attention measures targeting item or sequence information. The current study highlights the need for integrative STM models, accounting for conjoined influences of attentional capacities and serial order processing capacities on STM performance and the establishment of the lexical language network.

Abstract = {Bilinguals spontaneously switch languages in conversation even though laboratory studies reveal robust cued language switching costs. The authors investigated how voluntary-switching costs might differ when switches are voluntary. Younger (Experiments 1–2) and older (Experiment 3) Spanish–English bilinguals named pictures in 3 conditions: (a) dominant-language only, (b) nondominant-language only, and (c) using 'whatever language comes to mind' (in Experiment 2, 'using each language about half the time'). Most bilinguals, particularly balanced bilinguals, voluntarily mixed languages even though switching was costly. Unlike with cued switching, voluntary switching sometimes facilitated responses, switch costs were not greater for the dominant language, and age effects on language mixing and switching were limited. This suggests that the freedom to mix languages voluntarily allows unbalanced and older bilinguals to function more like balanced and younger bilinguals. Voluntary switch costs reveal an expanded role for inhibitory control in bilingual language production and imply a mandatory separation by language in bilingual lexical selection.

Abstract = {An orthographically similar masked nonword prime facilitates responding in a lexical decision task (Forster & Davis, 1984). Recently, this masked priming paradigm has been used to evaluate models of orthographic coding—models that attempt to quantify prime-target similarity. One general finding is that priming effects often do not occur when prime-target similarity is moderate, a result that the authors interpret as being due to uncontrolled effects of lexical inhibition. In the present research, a new version of the masked priming paradigm, sandwich priming, was introduced in an effort to minimize the impact of lexical inhibition. Masked sandwich priming involves briefly presenting the target itself prior to the presentation of each prime. Results indicate that the new paradigm was successful. The predicted priming effects were observed for Guerrera and Forster’s (2008) T-All primes (e.g., avacitno–VACATION) and for primes differing from their targets at 3 letter positions (e.g., coshure–CAPTURE)—effects that are not found with the conventional masked priming paradigm. In addition to demonstrating the usefulness of the sandwich priming technique, these results also support the assumption that inhibitory processes play an important role in lexical processing.

Abstract = {Spatial frequency filtering was used to test the hypotheses that low-spatial frequency information in printed text can: (1) lead to a rapid lexical decision or (2) facilitate word recognition. Adult proficient readers made lexical decisions in unprimed and masked repetition priming experiments with unfiltered, low-pass, high-pass and notch filtered letter strings. In the unprimed experiments, a filtered target was presented for 105 or 400 ms followed by a pattern mask. Sensitivity (d') was lowest for the low-pass filtered targets at both durations with a bias towards a non-word response. Sensitivity was higher in the high-pass and notch filter conditions. In the priming experiments, a forward mask was followed by a filtered prime then an unfiltered target. Primed words, but not non-words, were identified faster than unprimed words in both the low-pass and high-pass filtered conditions. These results do not support a unique role for low-spatial frequency information in either facilitating or making rapid lexical decisions.

Abstract = {The acoustic realisation of a speech sound varies, often showing allophonic variation triggered by surrounding sounds. Listeners recognise words and sounds well despite such variation, and even make use of allophonic variability in processing. This study reports five experiments on processing of the reduced/unreduced allophonic alternation of Japanese high vowels. The results show that listeners use phonological knowledge of their native language during phoneme processing and word recognition. However, interactions of the phonological and acoustic effects differ in these two processes. A facilitatory phonological effect and an inhibitory acoustic effect cancel one another out in phoneme processing; while in word recognition, the facilitatory phonological effect overrides the inhibitory acoustic effect. Four potential models of the processing of allophonic variation are discussed. The results can be accommodated in two of them, but require additional assumptions or modifications to the models, and primarily support lexical specification of allophonic variability.

A paradigm for exploring what the mind does while deciding what it should do. Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology, 57, 311–320]. Subjects were presented with a word, and asked to either read it aloud or decide whether it appeared in upper/lower case. Task information, in the form of a brief auditory cue, appeared 750 ms before the word, or at the same time as the word. Experiment 1 yielded evidence consistent with the claim that at least some pre-lexical processing can be carried out in parallel with decoding the task cue (the 0 SOA condition yielded a smaller contrast effect than the long SOA condition). Experiment 2 provided evidence that such processing is restricted to pre-lexical levels (the word frequency effect was equivalent at the 0 SOA and the long SOA). These data suggest that a task set is a necessary preliminary to lexical processing when reading aloud. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study examines the nature of the involvement load (Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001) in second language (L2) lexical input processing through reading by considering the effects of the reader-based factors of L2 reading proficiency and background knowledge. The lexical input processing aspects investigated were lexical inferencing (search), attentional allocation during target word (TW) verification (evaluation), TW episodic memory after verification, TW retention, and changes in lexical input processing. This study also addresses the relationships between inferencing and retention as well as the relationships among the various phases of lexical input processing. A questionnaire on self-reported strategy use during the TW verification task was designed to examine motivation and cognitive involvement. A repeated-measures design was used with a cross-sectional sample of 35 adult L2 learners of Spanish. Participants read narratives (one more and one less familiar) that contained nonsense words. They guessed the meanings of the TWs. After reading all of the stories, participants completed-an online inference verification task whose goal was to confirm or to correct guesses and to encourage deeper processing of TWs. This was followed by a test of TW episodic memory (yes/no verification) and a strategy questionnaire. Afterward, participants completed two tests that measured receptive retention of meaning. Analyses reveal differential effects of the reader-based variables across the different aspects of lexical input processing and negative changes in lexical input processing due to an interaction between reading proficiency and background knowledge. Results illustrate how reader-based factors also affect learner involvement and lexical input processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the mechanisms underlying perceptual compensation for assimilation in novel words. During training, participants learned canonical versions of novel spoken words (e.g., decibot) presented in isolation. Following exposure to a second set of novel words the next day, participants carried out a phoneme monitoring task. Here, the novel words were presented with final alternations (e.g., decibop) in carrier sentences that either licensed assimilation (viable context: Our decibop behaved badly) or did not (unviable context: Our decibop does very well). Listeners had to monitor for the underlying form of the assimilated consonant (e.g., /t/ in decibop). Results showed more responses corresponding to the underlying form in viable than in unviable contexts. This viability effect was equivalent for novel words learned on the same day and on the previous day but was absent for unexposed control items. The processing difference between exposed and control novel words supports the idea that compensation for assimilation interacts with newly acquired phonological information and suggests that contextual compensation for assimilation is enhanced by lexical knowledge.

In Experiment 1, the subjects were required to name the pictures in English or Chinese. The results showed a significant switching cast for Chinese but not for English. In Experiment 2, the subjects made decisions by pressing the left or right key. A reversed pattern of switching cost was obtained showing a significant switching cost for English but not for Chinese. These results show that the switching process of language comprehension is different from that of language production. The switching cost in language production arises from competition between two schemas, while switching cost in language comprehension comes from inhibition within the bilingual lexical-semantic system.

Abstract = {The study uses an orthographic judgment task to evaluate the efficiency of the lexical reading route in Italian dyslexic children. It has been suggested that Italian dyslexic children rely prevalently on the sub-word-level routine for reading. However, it is not easy to test the lexical reading route in Italian directly because of the lack of critical items (irregular words), so visual lexical decision tasks and the comprehension/detection of pseudo-homophones are often used. While the former may also be solved on the basis of visual familiarity or phonological re-codification, the latter also involves conceptual and syntactic skills. Eleven dyslexic children participated in the study, performing an orthographic judgment task on stimuli with two phonologically plausible spellings, of which only one was orthographically correct. Their performance was compared with those of 11 proficient readers. The dyslexic children showed selective impairment in detecting phonologically plausible errors, but their performance was normal when required to judge errors inserted in words with regular orthography, i.e., devoid of orthographic ambiguity, and for which a sub-word-level reading procedure is sufficient to guarantee a good performance. Overall, data are coherent with a diagnosis of surface dyslexia, with most children showing defective orthographic lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The extant literature on oral and written language has shown several interesting differences in terms of production and style. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the content of word definitions provided by children in both the oral and written modes. A total of 30 typically developing children (mean age: 9 years; 2 months) defined common nouns in the oral and written modes. The definitions were coded for use of categorical terms (e.g., apple: fruit) and attributes (e.g., apple: red). The findings indicated that children displayed different types of word knowledge in the two modes, with written definitions generally having the advantage for production of categorical terms. Results are discussed with respect to the higher level of planning that is generally involved in written language compared to oral language. Implications for assessment and education are also discussed. This study expands the extant literature on how mode of language production can exert a considerable influence on a child’s display of lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {Distinct regions in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) preferentially support the processing of different word-types (e.g., real words, pseudowords) and tasks (e.g., lexical decisions, phonological decisions) in visual word recognition. However, the functional connectivity underlying the task-related specialisation of regions in the left IFG is not yet well understood. In this study we investigated the neural mechanisms driving the interaction of WORD-TYPE (real word vs. pseudoword) and TASK (lexical vs. phonological decision) in Brodmann's area (BA) 45 in the left IFG using dynamic causal modelling (DCM). Four different models were compared, all of which included left BAM, left BA45, and left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). In each model, the visual presentation of words and pseudowords is assumed to directly evoke activity in the ITG and is then thought to be subsequently propagated to BA45 and to BAM via direct intrinsic connections. The models differed with regard to which connections were modulated by the different tasks. Both tasks were assumed to either modulate the ITG_BA45 connection (Model #1), or the BAM_BA45 connection (Model #2), or both connections in parallel (Model #3). In Model #4 lexical decisions modulated the ITG_BA45 connection, whereas phonological decisions modulated the BAM_BA45 connection. Bayesian model selection revealed a superiority of Model #1. In this model, the strength of the ITG_BA45 connection was enhanced during lexical decisions. This model is in line with the hypothesis that left BA 45 supports explicit lexical decisions during visual word recognition based on lexical access in the ITG.

Abstract = {For lexical-gustatory synaesthetes, words trigger automatic, associated food sensations (e.g., for JB, the word slope tastes of over-ripe melon). Our study tests two claims about this unusual condition: that synaesthetic tastes are associated with abstract levels of word representation (concepts/lemmas), and that the first tastes to crystallise in early development are those triggered by food-names (e.g., apple tastes of apple; Simner & Ward, 2006). This concept/lemma-based proposal is difficult to immediately reconcile with the finding that non-words may also generate tastes (Ward, Simner, & Auyeung, 2005), since non-words have no concept/lemma representations. We manipulated the characteristics of non-words to provide three types of evidence that non-word tastes in fact stem from real word neighbours: Non-words with neighbours (e.g., keach) are more likely to generate tastes than those with no neighbours (e.g., vilps); pseudo-homophone non-words that are orthographically close to real words (e.g., peeple) are more likely to generate tastes than those that are more distant (baybee); and finally, the tastes of non-words are less consistent, and less intense, than those of real words. Additionally, we test the hypothesis that synaesthetic tastes develop initially from food-names by showing that non-words are more intensely flavoured if they are homophonic with food-names (e.g., toffie) versus non-foods (e.g., peeple). From this we conclude that synaesthetic tastes develop from food-names, and that tasty non-words do not challenge a concept/lemma-based account of lexical-gustatory synaesthesia.

The online versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2012-28751-001[/rid].) The coordination of word-recognition and oculomotor processes during reading was evaluated in eye-tracking experiments that examined how word skipping, where a word is not fixated during first-pass reading, is affected by the lexical status of a letter string in the parafovea and ease of recognizing that string. Ease of lexical recognition was manipulated through target-word frequency (Experiment 1) and through repetition priming between prime-target pairs embedded in a sentence (Experiment 2). Using the gaze-contingent boundary technique the target word appeared in the parafovea either with full preview or with transposed-letter (TL) preview. The TL preview strings were nonwords in Experiment 1 (e.g., bilnk created from the target blink), but were words in Experiment 2 (e.g., sacred created from the target scared). Experiment 1 showed greater skipping for high-frequency than low-frequency target words in the full preview condition, but not in the TL preview (nonword) condition. Experiment 2 showed greater skipping for target words that repeated an earlier prime word than for those that did not, with this repetition priming occurring both with preview of the full target and with preview of the target’s TL neighbor word. However, time to progress from the word after the target was greater following skips of the TL preview word, whose meaning was anomalous in the sentence context, than following skips of the full preview word whose meaning fit sensibly into the sentence context. Together, the results support the idea that coordination between word-recognition and oculomotor processes occurs at the level of implicit lexical decisions.

Picture-naming latencies were taken from the International Picture-Naming Project database (Szekely, Jacobsen, D’Amico, Devescovi, Andonova, Herron, et al. Journal of Memory and Language, 51, 247–250, 2004), word-naming and lexical decision latencies were taken from the English Lexicon Project database (Balota, Yap, Cortese, Hutchison, Kessler, Loftis, et al. Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007), and we collected semantic categorization latencies. Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that imageability and BOI separately accounted for unique latency variability in each task, even with several other predictor variables (e.g., print frequency, number of syllables and morphemes, age of acquisition) entered first in the analyses. These ratings should be useful to researchers interested in manipulating or controlling for the effects of imageability and BOI for multisyllabic stimuli in lexical and semantic tasks.

Purpose: In this study, the authors aimed to compare vocabulary size, lexical composition, and late talking in large samples of Korean and U.S. children ages 18–35 months. Method: Data for 2,191 Korean children (211 children recruited 'offline' through preschools, and 1,980 recruited 'online' via the Internet) and 274 U.S. children were obtained using the Language Development Survey (LDS). Results: Mean vocabulary size was slightly larger in the offline than the online group, but the groups were acquiring almost identical words. Mean vocabulary size did not differ by country; girls and older children had larger vocabularies in both countries. The Korean–U.S. Q correlations for percentage use of LDS words (.53 and .56) indicated considerable concordance across countries in lexical composition. Noun dominance was as large in Korean lexicons as in U.S. lexicons. About half of the most commonly reported words for the Korean and U.S. children were identical. Lexicons of late talkers resembled those of typically developing younger children in the same sample. Conclusions: Despite linguistic and discourse differences between Korean and English, LDS findings indicated considerable cross-linguistic similarity with respect to vocabulary size, lexical composition, and late talking.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2012-21937-001[/rid]). Children with specific language impairment (SLI) have particular problems using verbs. However, not much is known about how children with SLI retrieve different types of verbs. In the present study, bilectal Greek-speaking children with and without SLI were assessed on naming of different verbs held constant for argument structure but manipulated for lexical-semantic and phonological-lexical features. School-aged children with SLI as well as typically developing age and vocabulary-matched peers named 39 colored photographs representing actions in a confrontation naming task. Stimuli included actions involving an instrument (e.g., sweeping), i.e. instrumental verbs, and actions that have a name-relation with the instrument (e.g., sawing), i.e. name-related instrumental verbs as well as actions not involving an instrument (e.g., climbing), i.e. non-instrumental verbs. Instrumental verbs were significantly more difficult to retrieve than non-instrumental verbs for children with SLI and typically language-developing controls. In contrast, instrumental verbs with a name relation to the noun were significantly easier to name than instrumental verbs without a name relation for all groups. Children with SLI performed on par with vocabulary-matched peers. The results based on error types suggest that the greater difficulties children with SLI have with action naming is lexical-semantic in nature.

Abstract = {This article is an attempt to highlight one necessary element in establishing a complete strategy of usage-oriented realism, namely the role of linguistic items in starting off, or triggering, processes of understanding-as opposed to their role in standing for completed instances of utterance understanding. I use the term 'instructional semantics' about the dimension I want to emphasize, although the word 'instruction' may ring overly 'imperative': the point is that words can usefully be understood as designed to prod, or prompt, the addressee to carry out interpretive activities of specifiable kinds. This angle has been brought up from time to time, but has yet to seriously capture the imagination of linguists. I believe it has a key role to play in the more dynamic and user-oriented conception of linguistics that is now emerging. Among cognitive linguists who include this angle, Fauconnier (1985:2) uses the word 'instruction' about the 'under specified' meanings of linguistic items in calling upon the fully specified cognitive representations. At that time Fauconnier rightly argued that it was necessary to move towards the full cognitive perspective rather than limit one's attention to the purely linguistic input; I argue that more than twenty years later it is time to go back to the specifically linguistic perspective in order to be precise about its role in the full picture. In doing so I align myself with the position on polysemy taken by Tyler and Evans (2003:40), who use the word 'prompts' about the contribution of words to utterance meaning, and with Evans (2006) in distinguishing lexical concepts from conceptual models.

Abstract = {The present study examined semantic radical awareness in Chinese dyslexic children and how such awareness related to Chinese word reading. A group of Chinese dyslexic children (with a mean age of 10 years) and two control groups (with mean ages of 10 years 1 month and 7 years 7 months, respectively) were tested on Chinese word reading, semantic categorization skill, and positional and functional knowledge of semantic radicals. Results showed that the dyslexia group performed significantly worse than the reading-level control group in producing characters with the same semantic radicals. They also made less effective use of high frequency, lexical, and transparent semantic radicals than did age controls. Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that awareness of various aspects of semantic radical knowledge was a significant predictor of Chinese word reading. These results suggest that weakness in semantic radical awareness of Chinese dyslexic children may reflect their poor quality of lexical representation.

Abstract = {This article presents a theory of the development of lexical accents in edgemost stress systems, and their representations. It is shown that, first, the directionality of different levels of prominence at the word and above-word level, and, second, morphologization as a result of prosodic weakening work together for the development of various types of lexical accents. Our proposal makes a number of predictions with respect to: (a) whether a system will develop lexical accents, (b) their initial shape when the default stress is fossilized, and (c) their subsequent reshaping. To substantiate our predictions, we examine approximately fifty edgemost stress systems. Furthermore, we propose a two-dimensional theory of the representation of lexical accents that distinguishes between the morphological affiliation of an accent and its locus of pronunciation. The soundness of our theory is tested not only on the grounds of its explanatory power in capturing diachronic changes, but also with respect to its empirical coverage of contemporary theoretical issues concerning the representation of lexical accents.

Abstract = {We consider parallels in the development of conceptual knowledge and its disintegration in a neurological disorder. During development, children's concepts become more differentiated. Developing children make striking errors, attributing properties to objects that they do not have and over-extending frequent category labels to other objects. Patients with semantic dementia (SD), a progressive condition affecting the anterior temporal lobes, show a loss of differentiation of concepts. Like developing children, they attribute properties to objects that they do not have and over-extend frequent category labels. Such patients may draw four legs on a duck, or call an elephant a horse. We present a theoretical framework and computational models that explain these parallel phenomena. We also consider the disintegration of lexical knowledge, which parallels the deterioration of semantics in SD patients. We present a model that simulates these findings within a single system that processes and represents both lexical and semantic information.

Abstract = {When a speaker names an object using a gender-marked pronominal form, the referent word corresponding to the target object has to be selected in order to access the grammatical gender. By contrast, the phonological content of the referent word is not needed. In two picture-naming interference experiments we explored whether the lexical selection of a referent word is affected by its phonological properties. In Experiment 1, Spanish participants named pictures using a sentence with a noun or a pronoun while ignoring words semantically or phonologically related. The results showed a semantic interference effect and a Phonological Facilitation Effect (PFE) in both type of utterances. In Experiment 2 the PFE was replicated with Italian participants in a different pronominal utterance. The PFE suggests that the lexical selection of the referent word is facilitated by the presentation of a distractor word phonologically related. These findings are consistent with the predictions of interactive models of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This research examines phonological neighbourhoods in the lexicons of children acquiring English. Analyses of neighbourhood densities were done on children's earliest words and on a corpus of spontaneous speech, used to measure neighbours in the target language. Neighbourhood densities were analyzed for words created by changing segments in word-onset position (rhyme neighbours as in pin/bin), vowel position (consonant neighbours as in pin/pan/) and word-offset position (lead neighbours as in pin/pit). Results indicated that neighbours in children's early lexicons are significantly more often distinguished in word-onset position (rhyme neighbours) and significantly less often distinguished in word-offset position (lead neighbours). Moreover, patterns in child language are more extreme than in the target language. Findings are discussed within the PRIMIR framework (Processing Rich Information from Multidimensional Interaction Representations; Werker & Curtin, 2005). It is argued that early perceptual sensitivity aids lexical acquisition, supporting continuity across speech perception and lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {Speech perception requires the decoding of complex acoustic patterns. According to most cognitive models of spoken word recognition, this complexity is dealt with before lexical access via a process of abstraction from the acoustic signal to pre-lexical categories. It is currently unclear how these categories are implemented in the auditory cortex. Recent advances in animal neurophysiology and human functional imaging have made it possible to investigate the processing of speech in terms of probabilistic cortical maps rather than simple cognitive subtraction, which will enable us to relate neurometric data more directly to behavioural studies. We suggest that integration of insights from cognitive science, neurophysiology and functional imaging is necessary for furthering our understanding of pre-lexical abstraction in the cortex.

Abstract = {This study examines the sensitivity of early event-related potentials (ERPs) to degrees of word semantic knowledge. Participants with strong, average, or weak vocabulary skills made speeded lexical decisions to letter strings. To represent the full spectrum of word knowledge among adult native-English speakers, we used rare words that were orthographically matched with more familiar words and with pseudowords. Since the lexical decision could not reliably be made on the basis of word form, subjects were obliged to use semantic knowledge to perform the task. A d′ analysis suggested that high-skilled subjects adopted amore conservative strategy in response to rare versus more familiar words. Moreover, the high-skilled participants showed a trend towards an enhanced 'N2c' to rare words, and a similar posterior temporal effect reached significance ∼650 ms. Generators for these effects were localized to left temporal cortex. We discuss implications of these results for word learning and for theories of lexical semantic access.

Abstract = {Behavioral and electrophysiological responses were monitored to 80 controlled sets of emotionally positive, negative, and neutral words presented randomly in a lexical decision paradigm. Half of the words were low frequency and half were high frequency. Behavioral results showed significant effects of frequency and emotion as well as an interaction. Prior research has demonstrated sensitivity to lexical processing in the N1 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP). In this study, the N1 (135–180 ms) showed a significant emotion by frequency interaction. The P1 window (80–120 ms) preceding the N1 as well as post-N1 time windows, including the Early Posterior Negativity (200–300 ms) and P300 (300–450 ms), were examined. The ERP data suggest an early identification of the emotional tone of words leading to differential processing. Specifically, high frequency negative words seem to attract additional cognitive resources. The overall pattern of results is consistent with a time line of word recognition in which semantic analysis, including the evaluation of emotional quality, occurs at an early, lexical stage of processing.

FW03 consists of 20 lists of 50 words in four word-familiarity ranks (i.e., 4000 words in total). The entropy of (a) initial moras and (b) sequences consisting of a vowel and a following consonant was maximized in the word lists within each word-familiarity rank. FW03 is now published with speech files of the 4000 words spoken by two male and two female Japanese. The word intelligibility of FW03 was measured with the speech files at various signal-to-noise ratios. In addition to the signal-to-noise ratio effects, strong word-familiarity effects were observed in terms of word intelligibility, indicating that word familiarity is well controlled in FW03. FW03 enables us to measure word intelligibility in several word-familiarity ranks that correspond to the degree of lexical information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

In a replication and extension of their experiment in German, we failed to obtain priming effects from context pictures phonologically related to a to-be-named target picture. By contrast, corresponding context words (i.e., the names of the respective pictures) and the same context pictures, when used in an identity condition, did reliably facilitate the naming process. This pattern calls into question the generality of the claim advanced by Morsella and Miozzo that perceptual processing of pictures in the context of a naming task automatically leads to the activation of corresponding lexical-phonological codes.

Abstract = {This chapter argues against too free a use of 'equipollent framing' as proposed by Dan Slobin. Instead, it proposes an expanded set of criteria for main verb status, and finds them applying to languages that Slobin had considered to be equipollently framed.This chapter first argues that the concept of equipollent framing should only be applied to cases where a constituent expressing Path and a constituent expressing the co-event together serve most or all of a main verb-like function in a sentence, not where they are both outside a third constituent that does function as a main verb. In the latter case, the two constituents show co-satellite status or co-subordinate status, but not equipollent framing. Second, even in the applicable cases, actual equipollence in framing emerges as a seemingly much rarer phenomenon than previously claimed. The arguments against the claimed cases of equipollence are based on an expanded set of criteria for main verb status, and on principles for the assignment of lexical category.

Abstract = {Objective: To examine the effect of word length and several sublexical, and lexico-semantic variables on the reading of Italian children with a developmental reading deficit. Background: Previous studies indicated the role of word length in transparent orthographies. However, several factors that may interact with word length were not controlled for. Methods: Seventeen impaired and 34 skilled sixth-grade readers were presented words of different lengths, matched for initial phoneme, bigram frequency, word frequency, age of acquisition, and imageability. Participants were asked to read aloud, as quickly and as accurately as possible. Reaction times at the onset of pronunciation and mispronunciations were recorded. Results: Impaired readers' reaction times indicated a marked effect of word length; in skilled readers, there was no length effect for short words but, rather, a monotonic increase from 6-letter words on. Regression analyses confirmed the role of word length and indicated the influence of word frequency (similar in impaired and skilled readers). No other variables predicted reading latencies. Conclusions: Word length differentially influenced word recognition in impaired versus skilled readers, irrespective of the action of (potentially interfering) sublexical, lexical, and semantic variables. It is proposed that the locus of the length effect is at a perceptual level of analysis. The independent influence of word frequency on the reading performance of both groups of participants indicates the sparing of lexical activation in impaired readers.

Abstract = {Do consonants and vowels have the same importance during reading? Recently, it has been proposed that consonants play a more important role than vowels for language acquisition and adult speech processing. This proposal has started receiving developmental support from studies showing that infants are better at processing specific consonantal than vocalic information while learning new words. This proposal also received support from adult speech processing. In our study, we directly investigated the relative contributions of consonants and vowels to lexical access while reading by using a visual masked-priming lexical decision task. Test items were presented following four different primes: identity (e.g., for the word joli, joli), unrelated (vabu), consonant-related (jalu), and vowel-related (vobi). Priming was found for the identity and consonant-related conditions, but not for the vowel-related condition. These results establish the privileged role of consonants during lexical access while reading. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {People who are asked to classify whether words presented visually belong to the category of animals respond to nonwords derived from animal names more slowly than they do to nonwords derived from nonanimal names. This is known as the turple effect (Forster, 2006; Forster & Hector, 2002). In the present article, we show that the turple effect is modulated by the frequency of the animal names from which the nonwords are derived: In particular, we show that nonwords derived from high-frequency animal names are rejected faster than those derived from low-frequency animal names. We discuss the implications of this result for two approaches to lexical and semantic access modeling (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We report on three experiments that provide a real-time processing perspective on the poor comprehension of Broca’s aphasic patients for non-canonically structured sentences. In the first experiment we presented sentences (via a Cross Modal Lexical Priming (CMLP) paradigm) to Broca’s patients at a normal rate of speech. Unlike the pattern found with unimpaired control participants, we observed a general slowing of lexical activation and a concomitant delay in the formation of syntactic dependencies involving 'moved' constituents and empty elements. Our second experiment presented these same sentences at a slower rate of speech. In this circumstance, Broca’s patients formed syntactic dependencies as soon as they were structurally licensed (again, a different pattern from that demonstrated by the unimpaired control group). The third experiment used a sentence-picture matching paradigm to chart Broca’s comprehension for non-canonically structured sentences (presented at both normal and slow rates). Here we observed significantly better scores in the slow rate condition. We discuss these findings in terms of the functional commitment of the left anterior cortical region implicated in Broca’s aphasia and conclude that this region is crucially involved in the formation of syntactically-governed dependency relations, not because it supports knowledge of syntactic dependencies, but rather because it supports the real-time implementation of these specific representations by sustaining, at the least, a lexical activation rise-time parameter.

Abstract = {Background: Dejerine and Benson and Geschwind postulated disconnection of the dominant angular gyrus from both visual association cortices as the basis for pure alexia, emphasizing disruption of white matter tracts in the dominant temporooccipital region. Recently functional imaging studies provide evidence for direct participation of basal temporal and occipital cortices in the cognitive process of reading. The exact location and function of these areas remain a matter of debate. Objective: To confirm the participation of the basal temporal region in reading. Method: Extraoperative electrical stimulation of the dominant hemisphere was performed in three subjects using subdural electrodes, as part of presurgical evaluation for refractory epilepsy. Results: Pure alexia was reproduced during cortical stimulation of the dominant posterior fusiform and inferior temporal gyri in all three patients. Stimulation resulted in selective reading difficulty with intact auditory comprehension and writing. Reading difficulty involved sentences and words with intact letter by letter reading. Picture naming difficulties were also noted at some electrodes. This region is located posterior to and contiguous with the basal temporal language area (BTLA) where stimulation resulted in global language dysfunction in visual and auditory realms. The location corresponded with the visual word form area described on functional MRI. Conclusion: These observations support the existence of a visual language area in the dominant fusiform and occipitotemporal gyri, contiguous with basal temporal language area. A portion of visual language area was exclusively involved in lexical processing while the other part of this region processed both lexical and nonlexical symbols.

In Study 1, monolinguals performed better than bilinguals on tests of naming and letter fluency, but not on category fluency. When vocabulary size was considered, most of the effects disappeared or were reduced. In Study 2, a larger group of bilinguals was studied to compare the effect of vocabulary size, and a more restrictive version of the letter fluency task was used to increase executive processing involvement. In this case, bilinguals with matched vocabulary scores outperformed monolinguals on letter fluency, and bilinguals with lower vocabulary scores performed at the same level as monolinguals. The results are discussed in terms of the contributions of vocabulary size and executive control to performance on lexical retrieval tasks.

Abstract = {People with Williams syndrome are characterized by linguistic abilities that are higher than their level of intelligence. There is controversy concerning their reading level because there are few studies. The aim of this work was to test reading abilities in a group of school-age children with Williams syndrome. Their performance was contrasted with a control group of the same mental age. Three kinds of tasks were used: word and pseudoword reading, phonological awareness, and naming speed. Results show that the Williams syndrome children performed similarly to control children in reading accuracy but were slower in reading words and pseudowords. They were also slower in the naming speed tasks. These results suggest that Williams syndrome children do not have difficulties in developing grapheme-phoneme decoding but do present some difficulties in developing lexical reading.

Abstract = {Under many conditions auditory input interferes with visual processing, especially early in development. These interference effects are often more pronounced when the auditory input is unfamiliar than when the auditory input is familiar (e.g. human speech, pre-familiarized sounds, etc.). The current study extends this research by examining how auditory input affects 8- and 14-month-olds' performance on individuation tasks. The results of the current study indicate that both unfamiliar sounds and words interfered with infants' performance on an individuation task, with cross-modal interference effects being numerically stronger for unfamiliar sounds. The effects of auditory input on a variety of lexical tasks are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The semantic annotation of texts with senses from a computational lexicon is a complex and often subjective task. As a matter of fact, the fine granularity of the WordNet sense inventory [Fellbaum, Christiane (ed.). 1998. WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database MIT Press], a de facto standard within the research community, is one of the main causes of a low inter-tagger agreement ranging between 70% and 80% and the disappointing performance of automated fine-grained disambiguation systems (around 65% state of the art in the Senseval-3 English all-words task). In order to improve the performance of both manual and automated sense taggers, either we change the sense inventory (e.g. adopting a new dictionary or clustering WordNet senses) or we aim at resolving the disagreements between annotators by dealing with the fineness of sense distinctions. The former approach is not viable in the short term, as wide-coverage resources are not publicly available and no large-scale reliable clustering of WordNet senses has been released to date. The latter approach requires the ability to distinguish between subtle or misleading sense distinctions. In this paper, we propose the use of structural semantic interconnections—a specific kind of lexical chains—for the adjudication of disagreed sense assignments to words in context. The approach relies on the exploitation of the lexicon structure as a support to smooth possible divergencies between sense annotators and foster coherent choices. We perform a twofold experimental evaluation of the approach applied to manual annotations from the SemCor corpus, and automatic annotations from the Senseval-3 English all-words competition. Both sets of experiments and results are entirely novel: structural adjudication allows to improve the state-of-the-art performance in all-words disambiguation by 3.3 points (achieving a 68.5% Fl-score) and attains figures around 80% precision and 60% recall in the adjudication of disagreements from human annotators.

Abstract = {This study investigated Mandarin tone identification by 40 native listeners when only partial acoustic information was available. Twelve minimal tone pairs including all six Mandarin tonal contrasts were digitally processed to generate four syllable modifications: intact, silent-center, center-only, and onset-only. The syllables were recorded in two carrier phrases such that the offset of the carrier tone and the onset of the test tone were either a match or mismatch in fundamental frequency (f₀). In three experiments, the test syllables were presented in the original carrier phrases, excised from the carrier phrases, or excised and cross-spliced with another carrier phrase. Response accuracy and reaction time (RT) were measured. Listeners identified the tones at better than 86% correct with or without the carriers except when they heard the onset-only syllables in isolation, when their identification accuracy fell to 73% but still beyond chance. The modifications impacted the four tones differently, with Tones 1 and 2 being compromised more than Tones 3 and 4. Confusion matrix analyses showed that Tone 2 was predominantly confused with Tone 3, and Tone 1 was primarily confused with Tone 4. There were no main effects of splicing or match/mismatch with the carrier tone; however, in the cross-spliced context, syllables originally produced with a matching carrier tone were identified faster and/or more accurately. The implications of these findings for lexical tone processing are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two eyetracking-during-listening experiments showed frequency and context effects on fixation probability for pictures representing multiple meanings of homophones. Participants heard either an imperative sentence instructing them to look at a homophone referent (Experiment 1) or a declarative sentence that was either neutral or biased toward the homophone's subordinate meaning (Experiment 2). At homophone onset in both experiments, the participants viewed four pictures: (1) a referent of one homophone meaning, (2) a shape competitor for a nonpictured homophone meaning, and (3) two unrelated filler objects. In Experiment 1, meaning dominance affected looks to both the homophone referent and the shape competitor. In Experiment 2, as compared with neutral contexts, subordinate-biased contexts lowered the fixation probability for shape competitors of dominant meanings, but shape competitors still attracted more looks than would be expected by chance. We discuss the consistencies and discrepancies of these findings with the selective access and reordered access theories of lexical ambiguity resolution.

Abstract = {The objectives of this study are (a) to determine if native speakers of Canadian French at different English proficiencies can use primary stress for recognizing English words and (b) to specify how the second language (L2) learners' (surface-level) knowledge of L2 stress placement influences their use of primary stress in L2 word recognition. Two experiments were conducted: a cross-modal word-identification task investigating (a) and a vocabulary production task investigating (b). The results show that several L2 learners can use primary stress for recognizing English words, but only the L2 learners with target like knowledge of stress placement can do so. The results also indicate that knowing where primary stress falls in English words is not sufficient for L2 learners to be able to use stress for L2 lexical access. This suggests that the problem that L2 word stress poses for many native speakers of (Canadian) French is at the level of lexical processing.

Abstract = {Although natural language appears to be largely compositional, the meanings of certain expressions cannot be straightforwardly recovered from the meanings of their parts. This study examined the online processing of one such class of expressions: concealed questions, in which the meaning of a complex noun phrase (the proof of the theorem) shifts to a covert question (what the proof of the theoremis) when mandated by a sub-class of question-selecting verbs (e.g., guess). Previous behavioral and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) studies have reported a cost associated with converting an entity denotation to an event. Our study tested whether both types of meaning-shift affect the same computational resources by examining the effects elicited by concealed questions in eye-tracking and MEG. Experiment 1 found evidence from eye-movements that verbs requiring the concealed question interpretation require more processing time than verbs that do not support a shift in meaning. Experiment 2 localized the cost of the concealed question interpretation in the left posterior temporal region, an area distinct from that affected by complement coercion. Experiment 3 presented the critical verbs in isolation and found no posterior temporal effect, confirming that the effect of Experiment 2 reflected sentential, and not lexical-level, processing.

Abstract = {Although the dominant view posits that developmental dyslexia arises from a deficit in phonological processing and memory, efficient phonological decoding requires precise visual selection of graphemes. Therefore, visual engagement and disengagement of non-spatial attention were studied in 13 dyslexic children and 13 chronological age and intelligence quotient (IQ) matched normally reading children by measuring 'attentional masking' (AM) and 'attentional blink' (AB) effects. AM refers to an impaired identification of the first (T1) of two rapidly sequential targets (i.e., attentional engagement). In contrast, AB refers to an impaired identification of the second target in the sequence (T2; i.e., attentional disengagement). The results revealed a specific temporal deficit of AM as well as of AB in dyslexic children. Our results showed that the abnormality in AM and AB is rather widespread, since 77% and 54% of dyslexic children deviated at least 1 standard deviation (SD) from the mean of the controls, respectively, for the two deficits. We further showed that individual differences in non-spatial attention were specifically related to nonword reading ability. These results suggest that non-spatial attention deficits (possibly related to a parietal cortex dysfunction) may selectively impair the reading development via sub-lexical mechanisms.

Abstract = {In this study two experiments were developed to investigate the orthographic neighborhood effect on word recognition in 4th grade Brazilian Portuguese speaking school children. In the first, a lexical decision task of the Go/No-Go type was conducted, controlling the lexical activation index of words and pseudowords, an inhibitory effect of the number of neighbors (N) and of the number of neighbors of greater frequency than the target word (NF) was observed. In the second, a lexical decision task under a time-limit, the stimuli were presented briefly (250 ms) followed by a mask and the speed of the responses was emphasized. Compared with previous studies with adults in which, in these conditions, facilitative effects of N were observed, in this second experiment, the children continued to show an inhibitory effect of NF. It was argued that the orthographic neighborhood effect is genuinely inhibitory for Brazilian Portuguese and children, in contrast to adults, can present difficulties in employing strategies in the lexical decision task.

Abstract = {Two experiments examined the time course of lexical information availability in 20 adults, 20 children (8;0-10;0) with typical language development, and in 20 children (8;0-10;0) with specific language impairment. A cross-modal picture-word interference paradigm was used in which participants named the pictures as quickly as possible while ignoring the phonologically and semantically related interfering words. A novel early phonological interference effect appeared in all groups. Similar temporal patterns were revealed for the adults and the typical language development group, supporting the notion of similar underlying lexicalization mechanisms. Parametric differences were found in overall response times and errors, with children responding slower and producing more errors than adults. The presence of a phonological facilitation effect suggests that children with specific language impairment utilize phonological primes to ease lexical access. Children with specific language impairment exhibited lingering semantic inhibition and a late semantic inhibition effect suggesting difficulty in processing semantic information. Data from all participants support the cascaded processing model of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Impairments in phonological processing have been associated with damage to the region of the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), but the extent to which this area supports phonological processing, independent of semantic processing, is less clear. We used repetition priming and neural repetition suppression during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an auditory pseudoword repetition task as a semantics-free model of lexical (whole-word) phonological access. Across six repetitions, we observed repetition priming in terms of decreased reaction time and repetition suppression in terms of reduced neural activity. An additional analysis aimed at sublexical phonology did not show significant effects in the areas where repetition suppression was observed. To test if these areas were relevant to real word production, we performed a conjunction analysis with data from a separate fMRI experiment which manipulated word frequency (a putative index of lexical phonological access) in picture naming. The left pSTG demonstrated significant effects independently in both experiments, suggesting that this area participates specifically in accessing lexical phonology.

Abstract = {Four experiments examined how age of acquisition (AoA) and word frequency (WF) interact with manipulations of image quality in a picture-naming task. Experiments 1 and 2 examined the effect of overlaying the to-be-named picture with irrelevant contours. The magnitude of the AoA effect increased when the contours were added (Experiment 1), but the effect of WF remained constant (Experiment 2). Experiments 3 and 4 examined the effects of reducing the contrast of the contours defining the to-be-named picture. Both the effects of AoA (Experiment 3) and WF (Experiment 4) remained constant in the face of contrast reduction. These results provide an empirical dissociation of the effects of AoA and WF. The results are consistent with the idea that both AoA and the addition of irrelevant contours affect the efficiency of object recognition, but WF affects later processes involved in retrieval of object names. The theoretical implications of these findings in relation to accounts of AoA and frequency and their functional localisation in the lexical system are discussed.

Abstract = {It is commonly assumed that orthographical lexical access in visual word recognition takes place in parallel, with all letters activated at the same time. In contrast, in the SERIOL model of letter-position encoding, letters fire sequentially (Whitney, 2001). I present further support for such seriality on several fronts. (1) The reasons that led to the rejection of serial encoding are shown to be invalid, and the virtues of a serial encoding are discussed. (2) The SERIOL model's serial mechanisms provide a natural account of counterintuitive letter-perceptibility patterns, and correctly predict the temporal evolution of these patterns. (3) Via simulations, I show that serial lexical access accounts for conflicting data which indicate both a presence and absence of positional effects at the lexical level. In contrast, the experimental results at the letter and word levels are difficult to explain under the assumption of parallel lexical access.

Abstract = {The authors report a series of experiments in which they use the masked congruence priming paradigm to investigate the processing of masked primes in the manual and verbal response modalities. In the manual response modality, they found that masked incongruent primes produced interference relative to both congruent and neutral primes. This finding, which replicates the standard finding in the masked congruence priming literature, is presumed to reflect the conflict that arises between two incompatible responses and, thus, to index the extent of processing of the masked prime. Somewhat surprisingly, when participants were asked to respond verbally in the same task, masked incongruent primes no longer produced interference, but masked congruent primes produced facilitation. These findings are surprising because they suggest that the processing of nonconsciously perceived primes extends to the response level in the manual, but not verbal, response modality. The authors propose that the modulation of the masked congruence priming effect by response modality is due to verbal, but not manual, responses being mediated by the lexical-phonological production system.

Abstract = {When can children speaking Japanese, English, or Chinese map and extend novel nouns and verbs? Across 6 studies, 3- and 5-year-old children in all 3 languages map and extend novel nouns more readily than novel verbs. This finding prevails even in languages like Chinese and Japanese that are assumed to be verb-friendly languages (e.g., T. Tardif, 1996). The results also suggest that the input language uniquely shapes verb learning such that English-speaking children require grammatical support to learn verbs, whereas Chinese children require pragmatic as well as grammatical support. This research bears on how universally shared cognitive factors and language-specific linguistic factors interact in lexical development.

Abstract = {The development of language indicating the emergence of thinking about the thoughts of self and others has been scarcely studied in Spanish-speaking children. For this reason, we studied the development of mental state language and various indicators of language development in 25 Spanish-speaking children assessed at 3, 3 1/2, 4, 4 1/2, and 5 years of age. We coded and categorized the 40,250 utterances children produced during the five time points, 1202 (3.01%) of which had mental terms. In this sample, mental state language in Spanish children developed with a similar timeline and patterns as described in English-speaking children. However, several findings were novel for studies of mental state language. The general indexes of syntactic development did not correlate with the production of mental terms. The Index of Lexical Diversity was associated with the frequency of references to verbs of desire. The results of regression analyses suggest that not only the development of subordinate sentences with complement is associated with genuine mental references to desires and beliefs, but the development of lexical skills as well.

Abstract = {Masked priming is used in psycholinguistic studies to assess questions about lexical access and representation. We present two masked priming experiments using MEG. If the MEG signal elicited by words reflects specific aspects of lexical retrieval, then one expects to identify specific neural correlates of retrieval that are sensitive to priming. To date, the electrophysiological evidence has been equivocal. We report findings from two experiments. Both employed identity priming, where the prime and target are the same lexical item but differ in case (NEWS-news). The first experiment used only forward masking, while the prime in the second experiment was both preceded and followed by a mask (backward masking). In both studies, we find a significant behavioral effect of priming. Using MEG, we identified a component peaking approximately 225 ms post-onset of the target, whose latency was sensitive to repetition. These findings support the notion that properties of the MEG response index specific lexical processes and demonstrate that masked priming can be effectively combined with MEG to investigate the nature of lexical processing.

Abstract = {An influential hypothesis regarding the neural basis of the mental lexicon is that semantic representations are neurally implemented as distributed networks carrying sensory, motor and/or more abstract functional information. This work investigates whether the semantic properties of words partly determine the topography of such networks. Subjects performed a visual lexical decision task while their EEG was recorded. We compared the EEG responses to nouns with either visual semantic properties (VIS, referring to colors and shapes) or with auditory semantic properties (AUD, referring to sounds). A time-frequency analysis of the EEG revealed power increases in the theta (4-7Hz) and lower-beta (13-18Hz) frequency bands, and an early power increase and subsequent decrease for the alpha (8-12Hz) band. In the theta band we observed a double dissociation: temporal electrodes showed larger theta power increases in the AUD condition, while occipital leads showed larger theta responses in the VIS condition. The results support the notion that semantic representations are stored in functional networks with a topography that reflects the semantic properties of the stored items, and provide further evidence that oscillatory brain dynamics in the theta frequency range are functionally related to the retrieval of lexical semantic information.

Listeners recover /t/s that speakers lenite: evidence from /t/-lenition in Dutch. Journal of Phonetics, 34, 73-103] showed that listeners are biased to perceive a /t/ more easily after /s/ than after /n/, compensating for the tendency of speakers to reduce word-final /t/ after /s/ in spontaneous conversations. We tested the robustness of this phonological context effect in perception with three very different experimental tasks: an identification task, a discrimination task with native listeners and with non-native listeners who do not have any experience with /t/-reduction, and a passive listening task (using electrophysiological dependent measures). The context effect was generally robust against these experimental manipulations, although we also observed some deviations from the overall pattern. Our combined results show that the context effect in compensation for reduced /t/ results from a complex process involving auditory constraints, phonological learning, and lexical constraints.

Abstract = {Background and aim: Impaired generation of verbs relative to nouns has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been associated with the frontal pathophysiology of PD. The aim of the present study was to measure noun/verb generation abilities in PD and to determine whether noun/verb generation is affected by stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Patients and methods: 8 participants who had been diagnosed with PD and had received surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN as well as 15 control participants completed a noun/verb generation task with four probe-response conditions--namely, noun-noun, verb-noun, noun-verb and verb-verb conditions. Patients with PD were assessed while receiving STN stimulation and without stimulation. Results: During the off stimulation condition, patients with PD presented with a selective deficit in verb generation compared with control participants. However, when receiving STN stimulation, patients with PD produced significantly more errors than controls during the noun-noun and verb-verb conditions, supporting evidence from previous studies that STN stimulation modulates a frontotemporal network associated with word generation. Finally, errors during verb generation were significantly correlated with item selection constraint (ie, the degree to which a response competes with other response alternatives) in the on stimulation condition, but not the off stimulation condition. Conclusion: Our results suggest that STN stimulation affects the ability to select from many competing lexical alternatives during verb generation.

Abstract = {Prior eye-tracking studies of spoken sentence comprehension have found that the presence of two potential referents, e.g., two frogs, can guide listeners toward a Modifier interpretation of Put the frog on the napkin... despite strong lexical biases associated with Put that support a Goal interpretation of the temporary ambiguity (Tanenhaus, M. K., Spivey-Knowlton, M. J., Eberhard, K. M. & Sedivy, J. C. (1995). Integration of visual and linguistic information in spoken language comprehension. Science, 268, 1632-1634; Trueswell, J.

This pattern is not expected under constraint-based parsing theories: cue conflict between the lexical evidence (which supports the Goal analysis) and the visuo-contextual evidence (which supports the Modifier analysis) should result in uncertainty about the intended analysis and partial consideration of the Goal analysis. We reexamined these put studies (Experiment 1) by introducing a response time-constraint and a spatial contrast between competing referents (a frog on a napkin vs. a frog in a bowl). If listeners immediately interpret on the... as the start of a restrictive modifier, then their eye movements should rapidly converge on the intended referent (the frog on something). However, listeners showed this pattern only when the phrase was unambiguously a Modifier (Put the frog that's on the...). Syntactically ambiguous trials resulted in transient consideration of the Competitor animal (the frog in something). A reading study was also run on the same individuals (Experiment 2) and performance was compared between the two experiments. Those individuals who relied heavily on lexical biases to resolve a complement ambiguity in reading (The man heard/realized the story had been...) showed increased sensitivity to both lexical and contextual constraints in the put-task; i.e., increased consideration of the Goal analysis in 1-Referent Scenes, but also adeptness at using spatial constraints of prepositions (in vs. on) to restrict referential alternatives in 2-Referent Scenes. These findings cross-validate visual world and reading methods and support multiple-constraint theories of sentence processing in which individuals differ in their sensitivity to lexical contingencies.

Abstract = {Many single case studies have reported selective impairment of proper or common names in anomic speakers, providing evidence for a categorical organisation of the lexical-semantic network. These dissociations have been observed in oral and/or written naming and sometimes in comprehension. Here we report the case of an aphasic patient with severely impaired phonological encoding presenting a dissociation between proper and common names. Superior production of countries and nationalities was observed in all output tasks (naming, reading and repetition). The interest of a preservation of proper name categories in the context of phonological impairment lies in the question of the propagation of categorical organisation to the processes of phonological encoding. We suggest that the observed dissociation can be explained by relative sparing of countries and nationalities at lexical-semantic level as in previous reported cases and that this organisation spreads beyond lexical selection, to phonological encoding.

Abstract = {Although dopamine may act as a neuromodulator of spreading activation within semantic networks, this role of dopamine in lexical networks has not been investigated. Hence, we sought to investigate the effects of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is associated with dopamine depletion, on spreading activation in the lexical networks. Ten Parkinson's disease patients and 11 normal controls performed the controlled oral word association test and the average word frequency for their responses was calculated and used as an index of spreading activation. The PD patients exhibited a lower average word frequency, suggesting increased spreading activation, and a significant relationship between the strength of the initial activation and subsequent extent of spreading activation. Most patients were taking dopaminergic medication and future studies may benefit from examining the changes in spreading activation in lexical networks in PD patients on versus off medication or in healthy controls taking either a placebo or a dopaminergic medication. Although these alterations in lexical access might be related to the reduction of dopamine, one of the hallmarks of PD, these patients also have alterations of other neurotransmitter systems and further studies are needed to more clearly identify the role played by these neurotransmitter on lexical access.

Abstract = {The forms of words as they appear in text and speech are central to theories and models of lexical processing. Nonetheless, current methods for simulating their learning and representation fail to approach the scale and heterogeneity of real word form lexicons. A connectionist architecture termed the sequence encoder is used to learn nearly 75,000 word form representations through exposure to strings of stress-marked phonemes or letters. First, the mechanisms and efficacy of the sequence encoder are demonstrated and shown to overcome problems with traditional slot-based codes. Then, two large-scale simulations are reported that learned to represent lexicons of either phonological or orthographic word forms. In doing so, the models learned the statistics of their lexicons as shown by better processing of well-formed pseudowords as opposed to ill-formed (scrambled) pseudowords, and by accounting for variance in well-formedness ratings. It is discussed how the sequence encoder may be integrated into broader models of lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Research on the mental lexicon has traditionally focused on two questions: What are the mechanisms that allow fast and efficient access to information about familiar words in listening and speaking? In what form is such information represented in the mind and the brain of the listener/speaker? The papers in this special issue of Cognitive Neuropsychology shed light on both of these questions, using experimental approaches varying from neuropsychological testing, to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), event-related potential (ERP), and computer simulations. Each of the investigations included in this special issue adopted methodologies that have severe limitations. Cognitive neuropsychologists are at the mercy of structural features that determine the nature and extension of brain lesions. ERP and fMRI depend critically on the detectability of neural signals and ultimately on brain physiology. In light of these strict constraints, it is even more remarkable that investigators could use these methodologies to draw conclusions about the functional organization of lexical mechanisms and their implementation in the brain. All the papers in this issue end with more questions than answers. Hopefully, these questions will foster future studies on lexical access.

Abstract = {Background: The syndrome of deep dysphasia is characterised by an inability to repeat pseudowords and the production of semantic errors in word repetition. Several single case studies revealed that phonological decoding might be outstandingly impaired. Recovery of deep dysphasia has only been illustrated in detail for patient NC (Martin & Saffran, 1992). Dell, Schwartz, Martin, Saffran, and Gagnon (1997) tried to simulate NC's repetition performance in their connectionist lexical activation model, but it did not fit his error pattern as it assumes perfect recognition of auditory input. Aims: In this new single case study on recovery of deep dysphasia, we intended to collect further evidence for the assumption that impaired input processing is the crucial cause of the impairment. Moreover, we aimed to explain impairment and psycholinguistic parameter effects in the connectionist semantic-phonological model (Foygel & Dell, 2000) by adding a phonetic input level. Methods & Procedures: JR's performance was repeatedly assessed in the course of recovery. Errors in naming and repetition were classified according to the taxonomy of Dell et al. (1997). JR's error patterns were simulated in the semantic-phonological model to determine the naming disorder and to predict word repetition. In addition, we established an error modality analysis to disentangle input and output impairments in repetition. Thus, the source of each error could be subclassified as belonging to either expressive or receptive components of repetition. Outcomes & Results: Initially there was a sharp contrast between severely impaired word and pseudoword repetition and almost unimpaired reading aloud. During recovery, performance in naming and word repetition improved a great deal, while repetition of pseudowords remained impossible. The evolvement of real word repetition was characterised by psycholinguistic parameter effects at different points in time: concreteness before length, before frequency. The connectionist model over-predicted correct responses in word repetition as for NC. There were only few expressive repetition errors; regarding receptive errors, nonwords and null responses decreased significantly while formal errors became the dominant error type in the course of recovery. Conclusions: The development of psycholinguistic parameter effects, dissociations in performance, the computer simulations, and results from error modality analysis as well as changes of error pattern are ample evidence for the primary decoding disorder in JR. We argue that deep dysphasia can be explained by an impairment of phonetic-phonological connections in an extended version of the connectionist one-route model of repetition with four rather than three levels of auditory word processing. The improved real word repetition despite persisting failure on pseudowords is accounted for by an increase of both phonetic-phonological and lexical-phonological connection weights.

Abstract = {In 4 picture-word interference experiments, speakers named a target object that was presented with a context object. Using auditory distractors that were phonologically related or unrelated either to the target object or the context object, the authors assessed whether phonological processing was confined to the target object or not. Phonological activation of the context objects was reliably observed if the target and context objects were embedded in a conceptually coherent scene (e.g., if the picture showed a mouse eating some cheese), regardless of whether the target was cued by its thematic role (agent vs. patient) or by color. However, this activation dissipated if the two objects were presented in an arbitrary object array (e.g., if the cheese was presented along with a finger). These findings suggest that conceptual coherence among multiple objects affects the information flow in the conceptual-lexical system during speech planning.

Abstract = {Recent research has indicated that phonological neighbors speed processing in a variety of isolated word recognition tasks. Nevertheless, as these tasks do not represent how we normally read, it is not clear if phonological neighborhood has an effect on the reading of sentences for meaning. In the research reported here, we evaluated whether phonological neighborhood density influences reading of target words embedded in sentences. The eye movement data clearly revealed that phonological neighborhood facilitated reading. This was evidenced by shorter fixations for words with large neighborhoods relative to words with small neighborhoods. These results are important in indicating that phonology is a crucial component of reading and that it affects early lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Irony is part of our daily experience, that is probably the reason why a lot of studies have been trying to define its nature and the way we are able to understand the pragmatic intentions lying behind ironic communication. This study addresses the issue of pragmatic comprehension of language by analysing the differences or similarities in processing ironical and non-ironical language. The aim of the study is specifically to explore neuropsychological correlates (ERPs) of irony decoding. 10 subjects listened to 240 sentences presenting a counterfactual vs. non-counterfactual content (counterfactual modality) and spoken with ironical vs. neutral prosody (prosody modality). ERPs analysis showed a negative deflection peaking at about 460ms post stimulus onset (N400) for all the conditions. Statistical analyses (repeated measures ANOVA) applied to peak amplitudes showed no statistically significant differences between the conditions as a functions of the type of sentence (ironical vs. non ironical) and the content of ironical sentences (counterfactual vs. non counterfactual). An increase of N400 related to ironical sentences was observed although no statistical significant differences between ironical and non ironical sentences were found. The absence of an N400 effect may indicate that irony is not treated as a semantic anomaly, thus rejecting the standard pragmatic hypothesis. The observed differences in amplitude could be probably attributed to a higher requirement for the cognitive resources in order to integrate contrasting and complex lexical, prosodic and contextual cues.

Abstract = {An investigation of the acoustic correlates of prosody in infant disyllabic vocalizations was undertaken on the basis of data from 10 each of American- and Finnish- and five each of French- and Welsh-learning infants at the onset of word use (10-18 months). The 639 disyllables were analyzed acoustically for duration, intensity and fundamental frequency (f0). The infants differed in their production patterns with regard to all three acoustic cues, although they agreed in exhibiting high variability in the production of intensity and f0. Infants exposed to each of the four languages showed evidence of final syllable lengthening and the production of both first- and second-syllable-stressed or accented disyllables. However, Finnish and Welsh infants produced proportionally more trochaic and iambic patterns, respectively. The use of acoustic prosodic cues at the onset of word use is argued to reflect a combination of biological predispositions and response to prosodic cues that show consistency in the input signal, while a more complete integration of prosody and segmental features seems to require more lexical knowledge or experience.

Abstract = {The role of sub-cortical structures in language processing, and more specifically of the striatum, remains controversial. In line with psycholinguistic models stating that language processing implies both the recovery of lexical information and the application of combinatorial rules, the striatum has been claimed to be involved either in the former component or in the latter. The present study reconciles these conflicting views by showing the striatum's involvement in both language processes, depending on distinct striatal sub-regions. Using PET scanning in a model of striatal disorders, namely Huntington's disease (HD), we correlated metabolic data of 31 early stage HD patients regarding different striatal sub-regions with behavioural scores on three rule/lexicon tasks drawn from word morphology, syntax and from a non-linguistic domain, namely arithmetic. Behavioural results reflected impairment on both processing aspects, while deficits predominated on rule application. Both correlated with the left striatum but involved distinct striatal sub-regions. We suggest that the left striatum encompasses linguistic and arithmetic circuits, which differ with respect to their anatomical and functional specification, comprising ventrally located regions dedicated to rule computations and more dorsal portions pertaining to lexical devices.

Abstract = {The role of morphological, semantic, and form-based factors in the early stages of visual word recognition was investigated across different SOAs in a masked priming paradigm, focusing on English derivational morphology. In a first set of experiments, stimulus pairs co-varying in morphological decomposability and in semantic and orthographic relatedness were presented at three SOAs (36, 48, and 72 ms). No effects of orthographic relatedness were found at any SOA. Semantic relatedness did not interact with effects of morphological decomposability, which came through strongly at all SOAs, even for pseudo-suffixed pairs such as archer-arch. Derivational morphological effects in masked priming seem to be primarily driven by morphological decomposability at an early stage of visual word recognition, and are independent of semantic factors. A second experiment reversed the order of prime and target (stem-derived rather than derived-stem), and again found that morphological priming did not interact with semantic relatedness. This points to an early segmentation process that is driven by morphological decomposability and not by the structure or content of central lexical representations.

Abstract = {Many models of word recognition predict that neighbours of target words will be activated during word processing. Cascaded models can make the additional prediction that semantic features of those neighbours get activated before the target has been uniquely identified. In two semantic decision tasks neighbours that were congruent (i.e., from the same category) or incongruent (i.e., from the opposite category) were presented in a long-term priming paradigm. Performance to targets was better if they were primed by congruent neighbours than if they were primed by incongruent neighbours. The same effect was found for rhyming and nonrhyming primes. The results support cascaded models that allow semantic information to become activated before lexical selection has finished. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Previous evidence supports differential event-related brain potential (ERP) responses for emotional prosodic processing and integrative emotional prosodic/semantic processing. While latter process elicits a negativity similar to the well-known N400 component, transitions in emotional prosodic processing elicit a positivity. To further substantiate this evidence, the current investigation utilized lexical-sentences and sentences without lexical content (pseudo-sentences) spoken in six basic emotions by a female and a male speaker. Results indicate that emotional prosodic expectancy violations elicit a right-lateralized positive-going ERP component independent of basic emotional prosodies and speaker voice. In addition, expectancy violations of integrative emotional prosody/semantics elicit a negativity with a whole-head distribution. The current results nicely complement previous evidence, and extend the results by showing the respective effects for a wider range of emotional prosodies independent of lexical content and speaker voice.

On the semantic task, all measures increased with age.

Abstract = {Although different in terms of purpose, word-selection procedures, and rating scales, both the ANEW (n = 1034) and DAL (n = 8742) lists, which have 633 words in common, provide normative emotional ratings for English words. This research compared the lists and cross-validated the two main lexical dimensions of affect. Parallel representatives of the two dimensions (Valence and Pleasantness, Arousal and Activation) were correlated across lists (rs = .86, .63). In tune with their separate purposes, the ANEW list, which was designed to describe emotional words, included more rare words, while the DAL, which was designed for natural language applications, included more common ones. The Valence-Activation scatterplot for ANEW was C-shaped and included fewer Arousing words of medium Valence, such as 'awake,' 'debate,' and 'proves,' while the DAL included fewer less common words descriptive of emotion such as 'maniac,' 'corrupt,' and 'lavish.' In view of these differences, list similarities strongly support the generalizability of the two main lexical dimensions of affect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The effects of lexical context on phonological processing are pervasive and there have been indications that such effects may be modulated by attention. However, attentional modulation in speech processing is neither well documented nor well understood. Experiment 1 demonstrated attentional modulation of lexical facilitation of speech sound recognition when task and critical stimuli were identical across attention conditions. We propose modulation of lexical activation as a neurophysiologically plausible computational mechanism that can account for this type of modulation. Contrary to the claims of critics, this mechanism can account for attentional modulation without violating the principle of interactive processing. Simulations of the interactive TRACE model extended to include two different ways of modulating lexical activation showed that each can account for attentional modulation of lexical feedback effects. Experiment 2 tested conflicting predictions from the two implementations and provided evidence that is consistent with bias input as the mechanism of attentional control of lexical activation.

Abstract = {We examined how linguistic context influences the nature of bilingual lexical activation. We hypothesized that in single-word context, form-related words would receive the strongest activation while, in sentence context, semantically related words would receive the strongest activation. Spanish-English bilinguals performed a semantic verification task on English target words preceded by a prime. On critical trials, the prime and target words were paired based either on a form-mediated relationship through the native language (L1), [e.g., bark (barco): BOAT] (Experiment 1) or on a semantically-mediated relationship [e.g., boat (barco): BARK] (Experiment 2). The prime word was presented either in isolation or after a sentence context. In Experiment 1 interference was observed in the single word condition only. In Experiment 2 interference was observed in both single-word and sentence contexts. The findings demonstrate that the context in which words are embedded has an impact on the type of lexical competitors that become active.

Abstract = {Speech-sign or 'bimodal' bilingualism is exceptional because distinct modalities allow for simultaneous production of two languages. We investigated the ramifications of this phenomenon for models of language production by eliciting language mixing from eleven hearing native users of American Sign Language (ASL) and English, Instead of switching between languages, bilinguals frequently produced code-blends (simultaneously produced English words and ASL signs). Code-blends resembled co-speech gesture with respect to synchronous vocal-manual timing and semantic equivalence. When ASL was the Matrix Language, no single-word code-blends were observed, suggesting stronger inhibition of English than ASL for these proficient bilinguals. We propose a model that accounts for similarities between co-speech gesture and code-blending and assumes interactions between ASL and English Formulators. The findings constrain language production models by demonstrating the possibility of simultaneously selecting two lexical representations (but not two propositions) for linguistic expression and by suggesting that lexical suppression is computationally more costly than lexical selection.

Abstract = {Semantic intrusions are inappropriate responses frequently observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. They belong to the same category as the words to be remembered, but their prototypic value remains largely unexplored. The prototype is the most representative word in a particular lexical category. The prototypic value is measured according to different criteria: written and oral lexical frequency, frequency of use, degree of typicality, degree of familiarity and rank of quotation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the prototypic value of intrusions produced by 17 Alzheimer's patients with mild to severe dementia, during the cued recall of the Grober & Buschke procedure (RL/RI 16 items). The prototypic value was compared to the categorial norms provided by 1) 17 control subjects and 2) the lexical database 'Lexique 3'. The results show that intrusions had a significantly higher prototypic value than targeted items. The prototypic value increased with the progression of the disease, and according to the evaluation criteria used. Thus with the criteria 'frequency of use', 'degree of typicality' and 'degree of familiarity,' the prototypic value increased exponentially with the severity of dementia. In contrast, in spite of the development of the pathology, the prototypic value decreased when assessed by the criteria of 'rank of quotation', and 'lexical frequency' (oral and written). In conclusion, the qualitative analysis of the prototypic value of intrusion errors in Alzheimers opens up new clinical and methodological considerations.

Abstract = {The present study examined whether type of inflectional case (semantic or grammatical) and phonological and morphological transparency affect the processing of Finnish modifier-head agreement in reading. Readers' eye movement patterns were registered. In Experiment 1, an agreeing modifier condition (agreement was transparent) was compared with a no-modifier condition, and in Experiment 2, similar constructions with opaque agreement were used. In both experiments, agreement was found to affect the processing of the target noun with some delay. In Experiment 3, unmarked and case-marked modifiers were used. The results again demonstrated a delayed agreement effect, ruling out the possibility that the agreement effects observed in Experiments 1 and 2 reflect a mere modifier-presence effect. We concluded that agreement exerts its effect at the level of syntactic integration but not at the level of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Selective 'blindness' to repeated words in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) occurs even when omitting these words compromises sentence syntax and meaning. The contributions of lexical and contextual factors to this repetition blindness (RB) phenomenon were evaluated using three tasks that combined RB and ambiguity resolution paradigms. During an RSVP sentence, a repeated word and matched but incongruous control were presented simultaneously, and participants were asked to report the entire sentence, including only the appropriate word. Substantial RB was evident in impaired report of repeated targets, whereas report of nonrepeated targets was enhanced when the distractor was a repeat. Experiment 2 confirmed these results with reduced reporting requirements, and Experiment 3 demonstrated the independence of repetition and sentence congruity effects. Results across all contexts support a lexical account of RB, which assumes that reactivation and identification of rapidly repeated words are impaired due to the refractory nature of lexical representations.

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that English infants are sensitive to mispronun ciations of vowels in familiar words by as early as 15-months of age. Thes results suggest that not only are infants sensitive to large mispronunciations of the vowels in words, but also sensitive to smaller mispronunciations, involving changes to only one dimension of the vowel. The current study broadens this research by comparing infants' sensitivity to the different types of changes involved in the mispronunciations. These included changes to the backness, height, and roundedness of the vowel. Our results confirm that 18-month-olds are sensitive to small changes to the vowels in familiar words Our results also indicate a differential sensitivity of vocalic specification, with infants being more sensitive to changes in vowel height and vowel backness than vowel roundedness. Taken together, the results provide clear evidence for specificity of vowels and vocalic features such as vowel height and backness in infants' lexical representations.

Abstract = {Newly learned spoken words (e.g., 'cathedruke') become fully engaged in the mental lexicon, as measured via lexical competition with their pre-existing phonological neighbours (e.g., 'cathedral'), over the course of several hours or days, and this lexical restructuring is associated with sleep (Dumay & Gaskell, 2007). Here, we investigated the longer-term effects of word learning for three sets of novel words learned at different times using phoneme monitoring and repetition tasks. The effects of these exposure sessions on lexical memory were assessed in a battery of tests. Lexical decision latencies to pre-existing neighbouring words showed that lexical competition effects for the novel words remained observable 8 months after initial exposure. Furthermore, the order-of-acquisition of the novel words affected their production speed (but not recognition speed), with an advantage for earlier acquired words. The results suggest that the consolidation of novel words results in a long-term and stable change in the lexical competition process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Three cued-recall experiments examined the effect of category typicality on the ordering of words in sentence production. Past research has found that typical items tend to be mentioned before atypical items in a phrase--a pattern usually associated with lexical variables (like word frequency), and yet typicality is a conceptual variable. Experiment 1 revealed that an appropriate conceptual framework was necessary to yield the typicality effect. Experiment 2 tested ad hoc categories that do not have prior representations in long-term memory and yielded no typicality effect. Experiment 3 used carefully matched sentences in which two category members appeared in the same or in different phrases. Typicality affected word order only when the two words appeared in the same phrase. These results are consistent with an account in which typicality has its origin in conceptual structure, which leads to differences in lexical accessibility in appropriate contexts.

Consistent with a similar object naming study with adults (Vitkovitch, Kirby & Tyrrell, 1996) and a study with children (Gershkoff-Stowe, 2002), picture naming errors referred to earlier named objects. However, while adults showed below-chance interference from objects that had only just been named (Lag 1), children were most susceptible to interference from very recently named objects (see also Gershkoff-Stowe, 2002). Furthermore, the proportion of younger children making Lag 1 errors was higher than the proportion of older children making Lag 1 errors.

Abstract = {Despite the increased comprehension of the role of the basal ganglia in cognitive functions such as learning, attention, and executive functions, the exact implication of these structures in language remains unclear. A specific role of basal ganglia in language has been proposed. Nonetheless, a recent hypothesis gives the basal ganglia a non-language specific role in the inhibition of competing alternatives during later controlled processes of language production. In this study we assessed the production of both nouns and verbs in a population of 20 nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease (NDPD). Aspects of selection demands and stimulus-response association strength were investigated in both tasks. Performance of NDPD patients was compared with that of 20 matched elderly subjects. An impairment in verb production was found in PD patients. A selection effect on verb production was found in PD patients along with a greater effect of stimulus-response association strength. PD patients had the greatest difficulty in situations of weak stimulus-response association strength. A 'Task-Relevant-Response' analysis carried out on stimuli (nouns) in condition of free association suggested that verb production happens in the context of strongly activated nouns. This means that, in order to produce a verb a switch has to be done from a task irrelevant to a task relevant response. Our results are in line with the proposed non-language specific involvement of the basal ganglia in the supervisory rather than the routine semantic processes required during lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {Despite arguments for the relative ease of learning common noun meanings, semantic development continues well past the early years of language acquisition even for names of concrete objects. We studied evolution of the use of common nouns during later lexical development. Children aged 5-14 years and adults named common household objects and their naming patterns were compared. Children showed a gradual convergence to the adult categories through addition of new words to the vocabulary as well as extended reorganizations of existing categories. Different theories of early lexical development make competing proposals about the differences in featural knowledge that result in discrepancies from adult word use. To evaluate these theories with respect to later lexical development, we used features collected from adults and children to predict the naming patterns of the different age groups. Consistent with [Mervis, C. B. (1987). Child-basic object categories and early lexical development. In U. Neisser (Ed.), Concepts and conceptual development: ecological and intellectual factors in categorisation (pp. 201-233).

A sorting task showed that, furthermore, evolution of general conceptual knowledge as well as word-specific knowledge contributes to the convergence. We discuss implications for developing a theory of later lexical development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We have proposed that consonants give cues primarily about the lexicon, whereas vowels carry cues about syntax. In a study supporting this hypothesis, we showed that when segmenting words from an artificial continuous stream, participants compute statistical relations over consonants, but not over vowels. In the study reported here, we tested the symmetrical hypothesis that when participants listen to words in a speech stream, they tend to exploit relations among vowels to extract generalizations, but tend to disregard the same relations among consonants. In our streams, participants could segment words on the basis of transitional probabilities in one tier and could extract a structural regularity in the other tier. Participants used consonants to extract words, but vowels to extract a structural generalization. They were unable to extract the same generalization using consonants, even when word segmentation was facilitated and the generalization made simpler. Our results suggest that different signal-driven computations prime lexical and grammatical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In the present study we analyzed the processing of grammatically anomalous sentences like 'The famous dancer were nervously preparing herself/themselves to face the crowd', which contains two anomalies, one early and one late. We investigated how processing of the later anomaly (at the pronoun 'herself' or 'themselves') was affected by the processing of the early anomaly (at 'were'). We considered two processing scenarios involving the first anomaly: (1) The representation of the subject-verb number agreement error at the first verb is coerced to match the verb, rendering 'herself' anomalous; (2) The representation of the subject-verb agreement error is coerced to match the subject noun, rendering 'themselves' anomalous. Our dependent measure was event-related scalp potentials (ERPs). When the pronoun disagreed with the verb (and agreed with the subject), a P600 was recorded, while the opposite condition elicited no reliable effect. Our data suggest that interpretation of reflexive pronouns involves the reactivation of multiple lexical items, verbs included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Language acquisition may be one of the most difficult tasks that children face during development. They have to segment words from fluent speech, figure out the meanings of these words, and discover the syntactic constraints for joining them together into meaningful sentences. Over the past couple of decades, computational modeling has emerged as a new paradigm for gaining insights into the mechanisms by which children may accomplish these feats. Unfortunately, many of these models assume a computational complexity and linguistic knowledge likely to be beyond the abilities of developing young children. This article shows that, using simple statistical procedures, significant correlations exist between the beginnings and endings of a word and its lexical category in English, Dutch, French, and Japanese. Therefore, phonetic information can contribute to individuating higher level structural properties of these languages. This article also presents a simple 2-layer connectionist model that, once trained with an initial small sample of words labeled for lexical category, can infer the lexical category of a large proportion of novel words using only word-edge phonological information, namely the first and last phoneme of a word. The results suggest that simple procedures combined with phonetic information perceptually available to children provide solid scaffolding for emerging lexical categories in language development.

Abstract = {This chapter reports an investigation into the capacity of language learners to improve their performance through the memorization of specifically targeted linguistic material. Six intermediate/advanced learners of English memorized nativelike versions of conversational turns that they anticipated needing in future conversations. After rehearsal, they attempted to use the memorized material in real interaction. Recordings of all stages of the process were transcribed and analyzed, to identify the nature of the deviations made from the targets. Nativelike deviations are interpreted as a legitimate approximation of nativelike behaviour, since fully faithful reproduction of a memorized original is usually neither necessary nor desirable for those with the linguistic skill to make appropriate changes. Non-nativelike deviations are viewed as indicative of shortfalls in knowledge, poor attention focus, and over-optimistic risk-taking during memorization. Individual profiles of the learners are presented, and it is proposed that memorization could be used as a means of establishing the strengths and weaknesses of learners in relation to morphological, lexical and phraseological knowledge.

Abstract = {The effect of lexical frequency on language-processing tasks is exceptionally reliable. For example, pictures with higher frequency names are named faster and more accurately than those with lower frequency names. Experiments with normal participants and patients strongly suggest that this production effect arises at the level of lexical access. Further work has suggested that within lexical access this effect arises at the level of lexical representations. Here we present patient E.C. who shows an effect of lexical frequency on his nonword error rate. The best explanation of his performance is that there is an additional locus of frequency at the interface of lexical and segmental representational levels. We confirm this hypothesis by showing that only computational models with frequency at this new locus can produce a similar error pattern to that of patient E.C. Finally, in an analysis of a large group of Italian patients, we show that there exist patients who replicate E.C.'s pattern of results and others who show the complementary pattern of frequency effects on semantic error rates. Our results combined with previous findings suggest that frequency plays a role throughout the process of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The present chapter looks at the development of verbs in two semantic areas characteristic of Mayan languages: 'eating' and 'falling,' for which verbs are learned before children reach the 50-word mark.11 argue here that Tzotzil semantic structure leads children from the beginning into learning to refer to specific types of actions that covertly categorize objects by features such as dimensionality, orientation, texture, consistency, and material in the semantic areas where the language offers these options (e.g., 'falling,' 'eating,' 'holding,' 'breaking,' 'change of posture' actions). Elsewhere I have shown the effect of Tzotzil semantic structure on the acquisition of spatial terms denoting containment, support, contact, gravity (Bowerman, de Leon, & Choi, 1995; de Leon, 2001a, 2001c), and body posture (de Leon, 2005). In a language where children have an early preference for verbs, early semantic development is of interest in terms of how action reference may interact with the organization of object categorization (see Bowerman, 2005 for English; Brown, 2007). This point may open up new avenues into understanding the subtleties of lexical development and semantic typology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The traditional view of phonological representation assumes that lexical representation is economical and free of redundancy and that a phoneme is represented as a combination of contrastive phonetic features. The traditional view, however, is challenged by the recent developments in phonological theories. In Optimality Theory, the distinction between contrastive vs. non-contrastive aspects of pronunciation is made not by the lexical representation but by the constraint ranking and the commonly adopted principle of Lexicon Optimization requires lexical representation to be as close to the surface representation as possible. An exemplar model of phonology also assumes that predictable and redundant phonetic properties are also specified in the lexical representation and that each contextual variant of a phoneme forms a separate phonetic category. The current paper reviews recent studies on segmental mapping in interlanguage phonology, examines the nature of the L1 phonological representation that the mapping crucially refers to, and discusses how the interlanguage data bear on the debate on the nature of the lexical representation.

Abstract = {The neurodevelopmental disorder Williams syndrome (WS) was first described by two cardiology groups (Williams, Barrett-Boyes, and Lowe, 1961; Beuren, Apitz, and Harmjanz, 1962), both identifying the association of several clinical features in affected individuals: narrowing of the aorta (supravalvular aortic stenosis: SVAS), distinctive facial dysmorphology, slow physical growth, and learning difficulties. It took another couple of decades before the syndrome started to be extensively investigated by cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists, hoping thereby to gather data that might contribute directly to the question of whether or not the human mind/brain starts out with innately specified, cognitive-level modules (like grammar, face processing, spatial cognition, number, and the like) that operate independently of one another and of general intelligence. The widely held view was and still is to some extent that WS involves a juxtaposition of intact and impaired modules— that is, fluent language, excellent face-processing abilities, and a very friendly social disposition, alongside very poor spatial, problem-solving, and numerical abilities. But, as we shall in this chapter, the real picture of the WS profile is far more complex. Topics discussed here include the Williams syndrome genotype; the Williams syndrome phenotype; the phenotypic outcomes in adults: face processing and language; the infant start state versus the phenotypic outcome; building full developmental trajectories within domains and across domains; and multiple developmental factors contributing to lexical development in Williams syndrome.

Abstract = {In many languages there are words that behave like lexical verbs and on the one hand and like functional categories expressing distinctions of tense, aspect, modality, etc. on the other. The grammatical status of such words is frequently controversial; while some authors treat them as belonging to one and the same grammatical category, others assign them to different categories. The present paper is concerned with such a case of 'doublets': Looking in more detail at the German item drohen 'to threaten', it attempts to offer an account of the differences in the lexical and functional structure of this item by using grammaticalization theory as a framework. As the data presented in the paper suggest, this model in fact accounts for most though not for all of the properties characterizing the structure of the item. It is argued that in addition to synchronic analysis, a diachronic and comparative perspective is required in order to arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of the interface between lexical and functional structures.

Abstract = {Although the McGurk Effect is a well researched illusory phenomenon arising from discrepant auditory and visual speech information little is known about the influence of lexical processes on this phenomenon. Thus, we investigated the McGurk Effect using three letter consonant-vowel-consonant real word and pseudoword pairs with an audiovisual discrepancy positioned at either stimulus onset or offset. The results demonstrated that the frequency of illusions was similar for real words and pseudowords when the discrepancy was at stimulus onset but was significantly lower for real words when the audiovisual discrepancy was positioned at stimulus offset. Positioning of audiovisual discrepancy was not important for accurate auditory perception of pseudowords. These results suggest that the McGurk illusion is the result of audiovisual integration that occurs early in perception prior to word identification and that these early audiovisual integrative processes are modulated by lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {The discussion in this chapter will assume a broad conception of speech perception--that it includes all of the processes that are required in order to gain access to a representation of lexical identity when presented with a spoken word form, short of the mechanisms that disambiguate homophones on the basis of syntactic or semantic context. Since lexical identity must be understood at least in part in terms of the meaning associated with a particular word, this will include mechanisms that map auditory stimuli onto lexical meanings. However, it should be possible to distinguish among the stages of this mapping process, and our discussion of speech perception following focal brain injury will attempt to make such discriminations wherever possible. To facilitate this discussion, patient analyses will make reference to the general model of the central speech perception system. Between the acoustic-phonetic level and the semantic level of representation, the model posits explicit intermediate phonological representations (both segmental and lexical).

Abstract = {The lexical frequency effect in picture naming is generally assumed to constitute a signature of lexical access. Lexical frequency, however, is correlated with other variables, like concept familiarity, that can produce effects similar to those of lexical frequency in picture naming tasks. In this study, a delayed picture naming task was employed to address the hypothesis that the frequency effect in picture naming is due to variables that affect processing in the perceptual and semantic identification stages (i.e., input stages). Despite the fact that all the input processing stages were completed prior to the presentation of the naming cue, a strong frequency effect was still obtained in this task. These results establish that the lexical frequency effect is independent of variables affecting the input stages of picture naming, and, hence, confirm the lexical frequency effect as a signature effect of lexical access.

Abstract = {Recent data from compound word processing suggests that compounds are recognized via their constituent lexemes (Juhasz, Starr, Inhoff, & Placke, 2003). The present lexical decision experiment manipulated orthogonally the frequency of the constituents of compound words in two languages: Basque and Spanish. Basque and Spanish diverge widely in their morphological properties and in the number of existing compound words. Furthermore, the head lexeme (i.e., the most meaningful lexeme related to the whole-word meaning) in Spanish tends to be the second lexeme, whereas in Basque the percentage is more distributed. Results showed a facilitative effect of the frequency of the second lexeme, in both Basque and Spanish compounds. Thus, both Basque and Spanish readers decompose compounds into their constituents for lexical access, and this decomposition is carried out in a language-independent and blind-to-semantics manner. We examine the implications of these results for models of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Word learning was poorer than has previously been reported in the literature, and subject to influences of word type (domain specificity) and word class.

Abstract = {Participants report briefly-presented words more accurately when two copies are presented, one in the left visual field (LVF) and another in the right visual field (RVF), than when only a single copy is presented. This effect is known as the 'redundant bilateral advantage' and has been interpreted as evidence for interhemispheric cooperation. We investigated the redundant bilateral advantage in dyslexic adults and matched controls as a means of assessing communication between the hemispheres in dyslexia. Consistent with previous research, normal adult readers in Experiment 1 showed significantly higher accuracy on a word report task when identical word stimuli were presented bilaterally, compared to unilateral RVF or LVF presentation. Dyslexics, however, did not show the bilateral advantage. In Experiment 2, words were presented above fixation, below fixation or in both positions. In this experiment both dyslexics and controls benefited from the redundant presentation. Experiment 3 combined whole words in one visual field with word fragments in the other visual field (the initial and final letters separated by spaces). Controls showed a bilateral advantage but dyslexics did not. In Experiments 1 and 3, the dyslexics showed significantly lower accuracy for LVF trials than controls, but the groups did not differ for RVF trials. The findings suggest that dyslexics have a problem of interhemispheric integration and not a general problem of processing two lexical inputs simultaneously.

Abstract = {This study investigates masking effects occurring during speech comprehension in the presence of concurrent speech signals. We examined the differential effects of acoustic-phonetic and lexical content of 4- to 8-talker babble (natural speech) or babble-like noise (reversed speech) on word identification. Behavioral results show a monotonic decrease in speech comprehension rates with an increasing number of simultaneous talkers in the reversed condition. Similar results are obtained with natural speech except for the 4-talker babble situations. An original signal analysis is then proposed to evaluate the spectro-temporal saturation of composite multitalker babble. Results from this analysis show a monotonic increase in spectro-temporal saturation with an increasing number of simultaneous talkers, for both natural and reversed speech. This suggests that informational masking consists of at least acoustic-phonetic masking which is fairly similar in the reversed and natural conditions and lexical masking which is present only with natural babble. Both effects depend on the number of talkers in the background babble. In particular, results confirm that lexical masking occurs only when some words in the babble are detectable, i.e. for a low number of talkers, such as 4, and diminishes with more talkers. These results suggest that different levels of linguistic information can be extracted from background babble and cause different types of linguistic competition for target-word identification. The use of this paradigm by psycholinguists could be of primary interest in detailing the various information types competing during lexical access.

In an attempt to investigate the cause(s) of these difficulties, an in-depth evaluation of his semantic and phonological skills was carried out, in which lexical and phonological variables such as age of acquisition or phonological complexity were controlled. Jeoffrey's performance was compared to a child matched for age. Although Jeoffrey showed no apparent phonological deficit, our results revealed deficits in semantic processes. We argue that this boy's word-finding difficulties are the result of imprecise and unspecified semantic representations. Therefore, as this case demonstrates, it is essential to determine the origin(s) of children's word-finding difficulties, which could be different and specific for each child presenting such a lexical deficit.

Four Cantonese speakers with idiopathic Parkinson's disease received treatment based on the principles of Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT). Outcome measures included perceptual measures and acoustic correlates of loudness, pitch, intonation, and tone (only intonation and tone are detailed in this study). All four participants demonstrated an increase in loudness, an increase in pitch and pitch range, and improved intonation during connected speech, as measured perceptually and acoustically. However, there were no obvious changes in the accuracy of lexical tone production, based on either phonetic transcription or acoustic analysis. The lack of improvement in lexical tones may support previous claims of a dissociation in fundamental frequency control for intonation and lexical tone production.

Abstract = {An event-related potential (ERP) experiment was conducted to explore the differences between Chinese-speaking dyslexic children and normal school children in orthographic and phonological processing during Chinese sentence reading. Participants were visually presented with sentences, word-by-word and were asked to judge whether the sentences were semantically acceptable. The crucial manipulation was on the sentence-final two character compound words, which were either correct or incorrect. For the incorrect compounds, the second characters of the base words were replaced by homophonic or orthographically similar characters. It was found that, for the normal controls, the orthographic and phonological mismatches elicited more negative ERP responses, relative to the baseline, over a relatively long time course (including the time windows for P200 and N400) at the central-posterior scalp regions. In contrast, the dyslexic children in general showed no differences between experimental conditions for P200 and N400, although the more detailed time course analyses did reveal some weak effects for the N400 component between experimental conditions. In addition, the mean amplitude of N400 in the homophonic condition was less negative-going for the dyslexics than for the controls. These findings suggest that Chinese dyslexic children have deficits in processing orthographic and phonological information conveyed by characters and, compared with normal children, they rely more on phonological information to access lexical semantics in sentence reading.

Abstract = {To assign lexical stress when reading, the Greek reader can potentially rely on lexical information (knowledge of the word), visual-orthographic information (processing of the written diacritic), or a default metrical strategy (penultimate stress pattern). Previous studies with secondary education children have shown strong lexical effects on stress assignment and have provided evidence for a default pattern. Here we report two experiments with adult readers, in which we disentangle and quantify the effects of these three potential sources using nonword materials. Stimuli either resembled or did not resemble real words, to manipulate availability of lexical information; and they were presented with or without a diacritic, in a word-congruent or word-incongruent position, to contrast the relative importance of the three sources. Dual-task conditions, in which cognitive load during nonword reading was increased with phonological retention carrying a metrical pattern different from the default, did not support the hypothesis that the default arises from cumulative lexical activation in working memory.

Abstract = {We investigated the detection of rare task-irrelevant changes in the lexical status of speech stimuli. Participants performed a nonlinguistic task on word and pseudoword stimuli that occurred, in separate conditions, rarely or frequently. Task performance for pseudowords was deteriorated relative to words, suggesting unintentional lexical analysis. Furthermore, rare word and pseudoword changes had a similar effect on the event-related potentials, starting as early as 165 ms. This is the first demonstration of the automatic detection of change in lexical status that is not based on a co-occurring acoustic change. We propose that, following lexical analysis of the incoming stimuli, a mental representation of the lexical regularity is formed and used as a template against which lexical change can be detected.

Abstract = {Recent studies reveal that naming has powerful conceptual consequences within the first year of life. Naming distinct objects with the same word highlights commonalities among the objects and promotes object categorization. In the present experiment, we pursued the origin of this link by examining the influence of words and tones on object categorization in infants at 6 and 12 months. At both ages, infants hearing a novel word for a set of distinct objects successfully formed object categories; those hearing a sequence of tones for the same objects did not. These results support the view that infants are sensitive to powerful and increasingly nuanced links between linguistic and conceptual units very early in the process of lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {The main objective of this paper was to characterize the new set of pictures proposed by Bonin, Peereman, Malardier, Méot and Chalard (2003) in terms of objective age of acquisition (AoA) collected in children (from 2:6 to 10:11 year old), following the Morrison, Chappell and Ellis's (1997) procedure (http://www.unice.fr/LPEQ/base_AoA/aoa_intro.php). The comparison to the French norms of Snodgrass and Vanderwart's (1980) pictures shows that Bonin et al.'s new pictures are related to later AoA and less frequent words. However, correlation and multiple regression analyses indicate that AoA is predicted by the same lexical factors (image variability, word frequency) across the two sets of pictures. In addition, for the two sets of pictures, rated and objective AoA are better correlated and specifically predicted by children's word frequencies (NOVLEX, Lambert & Chesnet, 2001 ; MANULEX, Lété et al., 2004) than by adult's word frequencies (BRULEX, Content et al., 1990 ; LEXIQUE, New et al., 2004). As highlighted by Zevin and Steinberg (2002), theses findings suggest the crucial role of corpus selection for approximating lexical frequency in psycholinguistic studies.

Abstract = {This study investigates whether second language (L2) phonological learning can be characterized as a gradual and systematically patterned replacement of nonnative segments by native segments in learners' speech, conforming to a two-stage implicational scale. We adopt a dynamic approach to language variation based on Gatbonton's (1975, 1978) gradual diffusion framework. Participants were 40 Quebec Francophones of different English proficiency levels who produced 80 tokens of English / / in eight phonetic contexts. In Analysis 1, production accuracy data are subjected to implicational scaling, with phonetic contexts ordered solely by a linguistic criterion--sonority hierarchy. In Analysis 2, the production accuracy data are similarly analyzed but with phonetic context ordering determined by psycholinguistic (processing) criteria--cross-language perceptual similarity and corpus-based estimates of lexical frequency. Results support and extend Gatbonton's framework, which indicates that L2 phonological learning progresses gradually, conforming to an implicational scale, and that perceived cross-language similarity and lexical frequency determine its course.

Abstract = {Deviances in early event-related potential (ERP) components reflecting auditory and phonological processing are well-documented in children at familial risk for dyslexia. However, little is known about brain responses which index processing in other linguistic domains such as lexicon, semantics and syntax in this group. The present study investigated effects of lexical-semantic priming in 20- and 24-month-olds at-risk for dyslexia and typically developing controls in two ERP experiments. In both experiments an early component assumed to reflect facilitated lexical processing for primed words was enhanced in the at-risk group compared to the control group. Moreover, an N400-like response which was prominent in the control group was attenuated or absent in at-risk children. Results suggest that deficiencies in young children at-risk for dyslexia are not restricted to perceptual and lower-level phonological abilities, but also affect higher order linguistic skills such as lexical and semantic processing.

Abstract = {A psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm was used to isolate the locus of the picture-word interference effect along the chain of processes subtended in name production. Two stimuli were presented sequentially on each trial, separated by a varying stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). The first stimulus, S1, was a tone that required a manual response. The second stimulus, S2, was a picture-word stimulus associated with picture naming. The abstractor word was conceptually related to the picture on half of the trials, and unrelated in the other trials. A picture-word interference effect was found at long SOA, but not at short SOA. Such underadditive interaction between SOA and semantic relatedness suggests strongly that the locus of the picture-word interference effect is functionally earlier than the PRP effect locus. The results are discussed in relation to models of word production suggesting the involvement of central mechanisms in the selection of lexical output.

Abstract = {Background: Both orthographic and phonological information from the target word can be appropriate cues in anomia treatment. Furthermore, both types of cues are used very frequently in clinical practice, although their underlying mechanisms of effectiveness and stability are still a matter of debate (e.g., Basso, Marangolo, Piras, & Galluzzi, 2001; Best, Herbert, Hickin, Osborne, & Howard, 2002; Howard & Harding, 1998). Aims: The aim of the study was to examine the mechanisms by which orthographic cues are effective in detail. The study addresses two questions. First, what is the relationship between sublexical transcoding ability and the effectiveness of orthographic cues? And second, what is the relationship between effectiveness of orthographic cues and effectiveness of phonological cues? Methods & Procedures: Three people with chronic aphasia and moderate to severe anomia participated in facilitation of spoken naming, using either the initial phoneme or initial letter of the target word. Both immediate and delayed effects were assessed over six facilitation sessions. Orthographic and phonological cue effects were investigated with regard to regularity of orthographic-phonological conversion (OPC) of the target's initial letter, and with regard to sub-lexical and lexical reading and repetition in the participants using a multiple single-case design (cf. Howard, 2003). Outcomes & Results: In one participant both phonological and orthographic cues produced similar effects. In the other two participants, orthographic cueing effects were present in the absence of phonological cueing effects. With regard to regularity of the initial letter-phoneme conversion in the orthographic condition, a similar pattern overall was present for regular, ambiguous, and irregular target words, e.g., initial letter cues seemed to be similarly effective in words such as KNIFE (irregular OPC of initial letter) as in words such as KING or DOLL. Conclusions: Initial letter cues are appropriate cues for the effective treatment of anomia as they may produce strong and long-lasting effects. In contrast to earlier predictions (e.g., Bruce & Howard, 1988), initial letter cues may be effective even in participants where the initial phoneme cue remains totally ineffective. There are likely to be various mechanisms of effectiveness underpinning orthographic cue effects: a sub-lexical mechanism and a lexical mechanism of effectiveness.

Abstract = {Background: Listeners make active use of phonological regularities such as word length to facilitate higher-level syntactic and semantic processing. For example, nouns are longer than verbs, and abstract words are longer than concrete words. Patients with semantic dementia (SD) experience conceptual loss with preserved syntax and phonology. The extent to which patients with SD exploit phonological regularities to support language processing remains unclear. Aims: We examined the ability of patients with SD (1) to perceive subtle acoustic-phonetic distinctions in English, and (2) to bootstrap their accuracy of lexical-semantic and syntactic judgements from regularities in the phonological forms of English nouns and verbs. Methods and Procedures: Four patients with SD made minimal pair judgements (same/ different) for auditorily presented stimuli selectively varied by voice, place, or manner of the initial consonant (e.g., pa -ba). In Experiment 2 patients made forced-choice semantic judgements (abstract or concrete) for single words varied by (1) concreteness (abstract or concrete); (2) grammatical class (noun or verb); and (3) word length (one- or three-syllable words). Outcomes and Results: The most semantically impaired patients paradoxically showed the highest accuracy of minimal pair phonologic discrimination. Judgements of word concreteness were less accurate for verbs than nouns. Among verbs, accuracy was worse for concrete than abstract items (e.g., eat was worse than think). Patients were more likely to misclassify longer concrete words (e.g., professor) as abstract, demonstrating sensitivity to an underlying phonologically mediated semantic property in English. Conclusions: Single-word semantic judgements were sensitive to both grammatical class and phonological properties of the words being evaluated. Theoretical and clinical implications are addressed in the context of an anatomically constrained model of SD that assumes increasing reliance on phonology as lexical-semantic knowledge degrades.

Abstract = {The mechanisms underlying short-term sentence recall have been the subject of recent investigations. While both semantic and phonological information have been found to play a role in sentence recall, this has been established using different paradigms in previous research. As a result, it is not clear whether the contributions of semantic and phonological information are equivalent subject only to specific experimental conditions. The present study used a common paradigm with equally plausible lures to systematically compare the roles of semantic and phonological information in short-term sentence recall. The lure intrusion paradigm was used with three different lures that were all equally plausible in the context of the sentence: semantic, onset, and rhyme. Further, no contextual cues were provided in the sentence to bias the participant. The findings indicate that there were significantly more semantic and onset intrusions compared to rhyme intrusions. This is interpreted in light of models incorporating lexical information during sentence production. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The current study addresses the controversial issue of how different grammatical categories are neurally processed. Several lesion-deficit studies suggest that distinct neural substrates underlie the representation of nouns and verbs, with verb deficits associated with damage to left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and noun deficits with damage to left temporal cortex. However, this view is not universally shared by neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies. We have suggested that these inconsistencies may reflect interactions between the morphological structure of nouns and verbs and the processing implications of this, rather than differences in their neural representations (Tyler et al. 2004). We tested this hypothesis using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, to scan subjects performing a valence judgment on unambiguous nouns and verbs, presented as stems ('snail, hear') and inflected forms ('snails, hears'). We predicted that activations for noun and verb stems would not differ, whereas inflected verbs would generate more activation in left frontotemporal areas than inflected nouns. Our findings supported this hypothesis, with greater activation of this network for inflected verbs compared with inflected nouns. These results support the claim that form class is not a first-order organizing principle underlying the representation of words but rather interacts with the processes that operate over lexical representations.

Abstract = {There have been a number of mechanisms proposed to account for recognition of phonological variation in spoken language. Five of these mechanisms were considered here, including underspecification, inference, feature parsing, tolerance, and a frequency-based representational account. A corpus analysis and five experiments using the nasal flap (found in a production of gentle in American English) both in isolation and in biasing sentential context failed to fully support any of these accounts. The results support a strong phonological representation for the [nt] form and a gradient strength representation in the lexicon for the nasal flap that is influenced by production frequency. The results are discussed in terms of orthographic and phonological experience with word forms in the formation of lexical representations.

Abstract = {Collaborative and content-based filtering are the recommendation techniques most widely adopted to date. Traditional collaborative approaches compute a similarity value between the current user and each other user by taking into account their rating style, that is the set of ratings given on the same items. Based on the ratings of the most similar users, commonly referred to as neighbors, collaborative algorithms compute recommendations for the current user. The problem with this approach is that the similarity value is only computable if users have common rated items. The main contribution of this work is a possible solution to overcome this limitation. We propose a new content-collaborative hybrid recommender which computes similarities between users relying on their content-based profiles, in which user preferences are stored, instead of comparing their rating styles. In more detail, user profiles are clustered to discover current user neighbors. Content-based user profiles play a key role in the proposed hybrid recommender. Traditional keyword-based approaches to user profiling are unable to capture the semantics of user interests. A distinctive feature of our work is the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles representing user interests in a more effective way, compared to classical keyword-based profiles, due to a sense-based indexing. Semantic profiles are obtained by integrating machine learning algorithms for text categorization, namely a naïve Bayes approach and a relevance feedback method, with a word sense disambiguation strategy based exclusively on the lexical knowledge stored in the WordNet lexical database. Experiments carried out on a content-based extension of the EachMovie dataset show an improvement of the accuracy of sense-based profiles with respect to keyword-based ones, when coping with the task of classifying movies as interesting (or not) for the current user. An experimental session has been also performed in order to evaluate the proposed hybrid recommender system. The results highlight the improvement in the predictive accuracy of collaborative recommendations obtained by selecting like-minded users according to user profiles.

Abstract = {In three experiments, we evaluated potential sources of familiarity in the production of feature and conjunction errors with both word (Experiments 1 and 3) and nonword (Experiment 2) stimuli and related this work to various dual-process models of memory. The contributions of letter, syllable, lexical morpheme, and conceptual information were considered. Lexical morpheme information was consistently more potent than syllable information in leading to feature and conjunction errors across Experiments 1 and 2, and a word length explanation did not account for this consistent finding. In addition, there was no impact of conceptual information on these errors (Experiments 1-3). The results support a familiarity-based interpretation of feature and conjunction errors and a lexical morpheme basis for the familiarity in compound words. In order to be more comprehensive, memory models may need to account for a lexical morpheme source of familiarity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this study we present a self-organizing connectionist model of early lexical development. We call this model DevLex-II, based on the earlier DevLex model. DevLex-II can simulate a variety of empirical patterns in children's acquisition of words. These include a clear vocabulary spurt, effects of word frequency and length on age of acquisition, and individual differences as a function of phonological short-term memory and associative capacity. Further results from lesioned models indicate developmental plasticity in the network's recovery from damage, in a non-monotonic fashion. We attribute the network's abilities in accounting for lexical development to interactive dynamics in the learning process. In particular, variations displayed by the model in the rate and size of early vocabulary development are modulated by (a) input characteristics, such as word frequency and word length, (b) consolidation of lexical-semantic representation, meaning-form association, and phonological short-term memory, and (c) delayed processes due to interactions among timing, severity, and recoverability of lesion. Together, DevLex and DevLex-II provide an accurate computational account of early lexical development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Sixteen Mandarin-speaking mothers were recorded while addressing their infants and addressing an adult. The results indicate that IDS does not distort the acoustic cues that are essential to word meaning at the syllable level; evidence of exaggeration of the acoustic differences in IDS was observed, extending previous findings of phonetic exaggeration to the lexical level.

Abstract = {The importance of phonological syllables in recognition and pronunciation of visual words has been demonstrated in languages with a high degree of spelling-sound correspondence. In Spanish, multisyllabic words with frequent first syllables are named more quickly than those with less frequent first syllables, but receive slower lexical decisions. The latter effect is attributed to lexical competition from other words beginning with the same syllable. We examined syllable frequency effects on naming and lexical decision for 3029 visually presented words in English, a language with a high degree of irregularity in spelling/sound relationships, and in which phonological syllables are less clearly marked in printed words. The results showed facilitative effects of syllable frequency in both tasks, and these were stronger when syllables were defined orthographically than phonologically. The results suggest that activation of lexical candidates based on a syllabic code does not occur rapidly enough to interfere with lexical decision in English.

Abstract = {The present study conducted two experiments to examine the effects of syntactic priming in sentence comprehension, using a cross-modal priming task which required participants to make acceptability judgment of Japanese sentences with canonical and scrambled word orders. Experiment 1 investigated whether or not the speed of target sentence processing would be affected by the syntactic structure of prime sentences. Prime sentences matching target sentences in word order facilitated processing of target sentences even though prime-target pairs shared no content words, while prime-target pairs with mismatched word orders demonstrated weak facilitation effects. Experiment 2 examined the processing speed of target sentences primed by a sequence of nouns without any syntactic structure. The weak priming effects disappeared in the noun prime condition, which suggested that those observed in the mismatch condition in Experiment 1 were due to partial overlap of the syntactic structure. The overall results showed that the priming effects observed in these experiments were syntactic in nature and independent of lexical/semantic priming.

Abstract = {Objectives: To examine whether the presence of domain-specific cognitive impairments would predict a response to donepezil medication in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). Methods: The protocol was an open-label study of 30 AD subjects (mean age 74 years; education 11 years; Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 23 of 30) beginning a 6-month course of treatment with donepezil. Global response to treatment was determined using a combination algorithm based on changes over 6 months in the ADAS-cog, MMSE and CIBIC. In addition, a set of neuropsychological and experimental cognitive tests designed to test five domains of cognition were administered before beginning therapy in order to determine which domain of testing would be predictive to response to treatment. The tests examined attention, short-term and working memory, learning and memory, visuo-spatial motor skills, and lexical-semantic knowledge. Results: Eighteen of the thirty subjects were rated as having responded (stable or improved scores on the combination algorithm) to the therapy. Responders were significantly less impaired prior to treatment on the following tests: the Clock Drawing Test, a Visual-Spatial Motor Tracking Test, and the Boston Picture Naming Test. No significant initial group differences were noted on the other neuropsychological or experimental cognitive measures. Conclusion: The tests that most reliably predicted response to donepezil in AD subjects were in the domains of visual-spatial motor abilities and lexical-semantic functioning.

Abstract = {We report a novel finding on the relation of emotion and language. Covert manipulation of emotional facial posture interacts with sentence valence when measuring the amount of time to judge valence (Experiment 1) and sensibility (Experiment 2) of the sentence. In each case, an emotion-sentence compatibility effect is found: Judgment times are faster when facial posture and sentence valence match than when they mismatch. We interpret the finding using a simulation account; that is, emotional systems contribute to language comprehension much as they do in social interaction. Because the effect was not observed on a lexical decision task using emotion-laden words (Experiment 3), we suggest that the emotion simulation affects comprehension processes beyond initial lexical access.

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that 20-month-old infants can simultaneously learn two words that only differ by one of their consonants, but fail to do so when the words differ only by one of their vowels. This asymmetry was interpreted as developmental evidence for the proposal that consonants play a more important role than vowels in lexical specification. However, the consonant/vowel distinction was confounded with another distinction, that of the continuous status of the phonemes used (discontinuous stop consonants versus continuous vowels). The present study investigated 20-month-olds' use of phonetic specificity while simultaneously learning two words that differ by a continuous consonant. The results obtained parallel those previously found for stop consonants, confirming the original claim of an asymmetry between the roles of consonants and vowels at the lexical level.

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the aspects of the lexicon in 66 prematurely born very-low-birth-weight and 87 full-term Finnish children at 2;0, studied using the Finnish version of the MacArthur Communicative Developmental Inventory. The groups did not differ in vocabulary size. Furthermore, the female advantage in vocabulary size was not seen in preterm children. The overall shapes of the trajectories for the main lexical categories as a function of vocabulary size were highly similar in both groups and followed those described in the literature. However, there were significant differences in the percentage of nouns and grammatical function words between the two groups. The results suggest that prematurity 'cuts off' the female advantage in vocabulary development. Furthermore, it also seems that there are differences between prematurely born and full-term children in the composition of the lexicon at 2;0. The findings support the universal sequence in the development of lexical categories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {During auditory language comprehension, listeners need to rapidly extract meaning from the continuous speech-stream. It is a matter of debate when and how contextual information constrains the activation of lexical representations in meaningful contexts. Electrophysiological studies of spoken language comprehension have identified an event-related potential (ERP) that was sensitive to phonological properties of speech, which was termed the phonological mismatch negativity (PMN). With the PMN, early lexical processing could potentially be distinguished from processes of semantic integration in spoken language comprehension. However, the sensitivity of the PMN to phonological processing per se has been questioned, and it has additionally been suggested that the 'PMN' is not separable from the N400, an ERP that is sensitive to semantic aspects of the input. Here, we investigated whether or not a separable PMN exists and if it reflects purely phonological aspects of the speech input. In the present experiment, ERPs were recorded from healthy young adults (N = 24) while they listened to sentences and word lists, in which we manipulated semantic and phonological expectation and congruency of the final word. ERPs sensitive to phonological processing were elicited only when phonological expectancy was violated in lists of words, but not during normal sentential processing. This suggests a differential role of phonological processing in more or less meaningful contexts and indicates a very early influence of the overall context on lexical processing in sentences.

Naming preferences for orthographically ambiguous but phonologically distinct English nouns and verbs, such as convict (CONvictn vs. conVICTv) were compared. In Experiment 1, ambiguous target words were preceded by unambiguous noun, verb, and letter (control) primes. Experiments 2 and 3 were designed to distinguish whether the priming effects observed in Experiment 1 have a syntactic or a semantic locus. In all three experiments, we found an influence of the part-of-speech of the prime on speakers' naming preferences for the target.

Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare cortical organization of the first (L1, Russian) and second (L2, English) languages. Six fluent Russian-English bilinguals who acquired their second language postpuberty were tested with words and nonwords presented either auditorily or visually. Results showed that both languages activated similar cortical networks, including the inferior frontal, middle frontal, superior temporal, middle temporal, angular, and supramarginal gyri. Within the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), L2 activated a larger cortical volume than L1 during lexical and phonological processing. For both languages, the left IFG was more active than the right IFG during lexical processing. Within the left IFG, the distance between centers of activation associated with lexical processing of translation equivalents across languages was larger than the distance between centers of activation associated with lexical processing of different words in the same language. Results of phonological processing analyses revealed different centers of activation associated with the first versus the second language in the IFG, but not in the superior temporal gyrus (STG). These findings are discussed within the context of the current literature on cortical organization in bilinguals and suggest variation in bilingual cortical activation associated with lexical, phonological, and orthographic processing.

Abstract = {Purpose: This study examined the longitudinal relationships between lexical and grammatical development in typically developing (TD) and late-talking children for the purposes of testing the single-mechanism account of language acquisition and comparing the developmental trajectories of lexical and grammatical development in late-talking and TD children. Method: Participants included 30 children identified as late talkers (LTs) at 2,0 (years; months), and 30 TD children matched on age, nonverbal cognition, socioeconomic status, and gender. Data were collected at 5 points between 2;0 and 5;6. Results: Cross-lagged correlational analyses indicated that TD children showed evidence of bidirectional bootstrapping between lexical and grammatical development between 2;0 and 3;6. Compared with the TD group, LTs exhibited less evidence of syntactic bootstrapping. Linear mixed-effects modeling of language sample data suggested that the relationship between lexical and grammatical growth was similar for the 2 groups. Conclusion: Lexical and grammatical development were strongly related in both groups, consistent with the single-mechanism account of language acquisition. The results were mixed in terms of finding longitudinal differences in lexical-grammatical relationships between the TD and late-talking children; however, several analyses suggested that for late-talking children, syntactic growth may be less facilitative of lexical development.

Abstract = {Cognitive models of word production correlate the word frequency effect (i.e., the fact that words which appear with less frequency take longer to produce) with an increased processing cost to activate the whole-word (lexical) phonological representation. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects produced overt naming responses to photographs of animals and manipulable objects that had high name agreement but were of varying frequency, with the purpose of identifying neural structures participating specifically in activating whole-word phonological representations, as opposed to activating lexical semantic representations or articulatory-motor routines. Blood oxygen level-dependent responses were analyzed using a parametric approach based on the frequency with which each word produced appears in the language. Parallel analyses were performed for concept familiarity and word length, which provided indices of semantic and articulatory loads. These analyses permitted us to identify regions related to word frequency alone, and therefore, likely to be related specifically to activation of phonological word forms. We hypothesized that the increased processing cost of producing lower-frequency words would correlate with activation of the left posterior inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Scan-time response latencies demonstrated the expected word frequency effect. Analysis of the fMRI data revealed that activity in the pSTG was modulated by frequency but not word length or concept familiarity. In contrast, parts of IT and IFG demonstrated conjoint frequency and familiarity effects, and parts of both primary motor regions demonstrated conjoint effects of frequency and word length. The results are consistent with a model of word production in which lexical-semantic and lexical-phonological information are accessed by overlapping neural systems within posterior and anterior language-related cortices, with pSTG specifically involved in accessing lexical phonology.

Abstract = {Lexical tone languages make up the majority of all known languages of the world, but the role of tone in lexical processing remains unclear. In the present study, four form priming experiments examined the role of Mandarin tones in constraining lexical activation and the time course of the activation. When a prime and a target were related directly in form (e.g., lou3 'hug--lou2 'hall'), competitors that differed from the prime in tone failed to be activated, indicating the use of tonal information to distinguish between segmentally identical words. When a prime and a target were not form-related but were related through a third word that was not actually presented (e.g., lou3 'hug'-jian4zhu0 'building', where lou3 is form-related to lou2 'hall', which was semantically related to jian4zhu0), a mismatch in tone prevented activation of minimal tone pairs at 250ms interstimulus interval (ISI) but did not prevent activation at 50 ms ISI. These results indicate that tonal information is used on-line to reduce the number of activated candidates, but does not prevent the minimal tone pairs from being activated in the early phase of lexical activation.

Abstract = {According to the spatial registration hypothesis, the representation of stimulus location is automatically encoded during perception and it can interact with a more abstract linguistic representation. We tested this hypothesis in two experiments, using the semantic judgements of words. In the first experiment, words for animals that either fly or do not fly were presented either in the upper or lower part of a display relative to the fixation point. Reaction times showed significant interaction between the spatial position and the word type. The words for flying animals were judged faster when they were presented in the upper part while the words for non-flying animals were processed faster in the lower part of the display. In the second experiment we extended the stimulus set to words denoting non-living things which are associated with either upper or lower spatial position. Again, reaction times showed significant interaction between the actual spatial position where the words were presented, and their implicit association with upper or lower spatial position. The results provide support for the claim that spatial representation has an active role in lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A discrimination study showed that differences between released /t/, unreleased /t/ and fully deleted /t/ in this specific /st#b/ context were salient. Two on-line experiments were carried out to investigate whether lexical activation might be affected by this form variation. Even though unreleased and released variants were processed equally fast by listeners, a detailed analysis of the unreleased condition provided evidence for gradient activation. Activating a target ending in /t/ is slowest for the most reduced variant because phonological context has to be taken into account. Importantly, activation for a target with /t/ in the absence of cues for /t/ is reduced if there is a surface-matching lexical competitor.

Abstract = {Patient studies that combine functional magnetic resonance imaging with chronometric analysis of language dysfunction may reveal the critical contribution of brain areas to language processes as well as shed light on disease pathogenesis. In amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease, we examined whether the brain system for associative-semantic judgments with words or with pictures is affected and how this relates to off-line chronometric analysis of word reading and picture naming. A consecutive memory clinic-based series of 13 amnestic MCI patients as well as 13 matched controls participated. One area, the lower bank of the posterior third of the left superior temporal sulcus (STS), showed a significant group-by-task interaction: In controls, it was activated during the associative-semantic condition with words compared with the visuoperceptual control condition but not when the same tasks were compared with pictures as input. In MCI, this word-specific activation was significantly reduced. Response amplitude correlated (r = 0.90) with the steepness of the slope of the time-accuracy curve for word reading. Our data provide converging evidence for a critical contribution of the lower bank of the left posterior STS to mapping word form onto word meaning (lexical-semantic retrieval).

Fidelity of phonological encoding was tested in a picture-fixation task using correctly pronounced and mispronounced stimuli. Only children with additional exposure in familiarization showed reduced recognition performance given slight mispronunciations relative to correct pronunciations; children with fewer exposures did not. Mathematical modeling of vocabulary exposure indicated that children may hear thousands of words frequently enough for accurate encoding. The results provide evidence compatible with partial failure of phonological encoding at 19 months of age, demonstrate that this limitation in learning does not always hinder word recognition, and show the value of infants' word-form encoding in early lexical development.

Abstract = {Syntactic priming is the facilitation of processing that occurs when a sentence has the same syntactic form as a preceding sentence. Such priming effects have been less consistently demonstrated in comprehension than in production, and those that have been reported have depended on the repetition of verbs across sentences. In an event-related potential experiment, subjects read target sentences containing reduced-relative clauses. Each was preceded by a sentence that contained the same verb and either a reduced-relative or a main-clause construction. Reduced-relative primes elicited a larger positivity than did main-clause primes. Reduced-relative targets that were preceded by a main-clause prime elicited a greater positivity than the same target sentences following a reduced-relative prime. In addition, syntactic priming effects were dissociated from effects of lexical repetition at the verb. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {To what extent do bilinguals have a single, integrated representation of syntactic information? According to Hartsuiker et al. (2004) [Hartsuiker, R. J., Pickering, M. J., & Veltkamp, E. (2004). Is syntax separate or shared between languages? Cross-linguistic syntactic priming in Spanish-English bilinguals. Psychological Science, 15, 409-414.], bilinguals represent syntactic information in terms of links between lexical representations and combinatorial nodes that specify syntactic structure, in a single cross-linguistic network. We describe predictions of this account and test them in two pairs of syntactic priming experiments with Dutch-English bilinguals. In Experiments 1 and 2, we tested priming in English (L2) production. Experiment 1 showed priming within English, and found that this priming was boosted by lexical repetition. Experiment 2 showed priming from Dutch to English, and found that this priming was boosted when prime and target used translation-equivalent verbs. However, this boost was weaker than the lexical boost in Experiment 1. In Experiments 3 and 4, we tested priming in Dutch (L1) production. Experiment 3 showed priming within Dutch, again boosted by lexical repetition. Experiment 4 showed priming from English to Dutch, but found no boost when prime and target were translation-equivalent verbs. We interpret these results in terms of an integrated model of lexical-syntactic representation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Worldwide, approximately 1 in 11 women have breast cancer at some time in their lifetime. The majority are successfully treated with surgery, then radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Survival brings its own problems, however, including an underlying ontological problem: What is the part of the body left after a mastectomy? Women talking about their experiences of mastectomy are faced with complex referential tasks with regard to their bodies at different stages of the past and present, within different discourses (medical, sexual, maternal), and from different perspectives (the individual and the generic, their own perspective and that of their medical professionals). Drawing on anthropological research conducted among Australian women, we illustrate how women resolve difficulties of reference to the site of the mastectomy, and examine the shifts in perspective that are marked by different lexical choices.

Abstract = {We investigated the neural correlates of semantic priming by using event-related fMRI to record blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses while participants performed speeded lexical decisions (word/nonword) on visually presented related versus unrelated prime-target pairs. A long stimulus onset asynchrony of 1000 ms was employed, which allowed for increased controlled processing and selective frequency-based ambiguity priming. Conditions included an ambiguous word prime (e.g. bank) and a target related to its dominant (e.g. money) or subordinate meaning (e.g. river). Compared to an unrelated condition, primed dominant targets were associated with increased activity in the LIFG, the right anterior cingulate and superior temporal gyrus, suggesting postlexical semantic integrative mechanisms, while increased right supramarginal activity for the unrelated condition was consistent with expectancy based priming. Subordinate targets were not primed and were associated with reduced activity primarily in occipitotemporal regions associated with word recognition, which may be consistent with frequency-based meaning suppression. These findings provide new insights into the neural substrates of semantic priming and the functional-anatomic correlates of lexical ambiguity suppression mechanisms.

Abstract = {The article considers neurophysiological and psycholinguistic motivations for applying mismatch negativity (MMN) to studying the language function, briefly reviews the current evidence in the field, and offers some further directions for research in this area. MMN, a well-known index of automatic acoustic change detection, has also been found to be a sensitive indicator of long-term memory traces for native language sounds (phonemes, syllables). When comparing MMNs to words and meaningless pseudowords, we found larger amplitudes for words than for meaningless items. This was interpreted as a neurophysiological signature of word-specific memory circuits/cell assemblies activated in the human brain in a largely automatic and attention-independent fashion. This lexical enhancement of the word-elicited MMN has now been replicated by different groups using different languages and methodologies. We have also demonstrated that, using MMN, it is possible to register differences in the brain response to individual words and even to different aspects of referential semantics, confirming that the cortical memory circuits of individual lexical items can be revealed by the MMN. In other studies, we found evidence that the mismatch negativity reflects automatic syntactic processing commencing as early as ∼ 100 ms after relevant information becomes available in the acoustic input. More recently, MMN responses were found to be sensitive to semantic context integration processes. In summary, neurophysiological imaging of the MMN response provides a unique opportunity to see subtle spatio-temporal dynamics of the neural processes underlying the language function in the human cortex in lexical, semantic, and syntactic domains.

Abstract = {Cochlear implants mostly give excellent results, especially when the implantation is done early in infancy. The idea of a 'sensitive period' for an optimal development of language during the first years of life is relevant when we measure the effect of early vs. late implantation. When normal auditory input is available, the developing neural central system offers space and organization for the auditory process. When auditory input is deficient or absent, this organization cannot take place; after several years of deprivation, the resources needed are no more available for the auditory process, even in case of late restoration of auditory access. Even in case of early implantation, it appears from extended evidence that visual information (lip reading...) increases speech perception insofar as a phonetic component is added to the impoverished signal delivered by the implant. The processes in play during the intermodal integration of visual and auditory information are related to phonetic coding and to the building of phonological and lexical representations of spoken language.

Abstract = {Disyllabic English nouns and verbs are distinguished phonologically according to their most common patterns of lexical stress: trochaic for nouns and iambic for verbs. The authors examined whether 'orthography' might also provide potentially useful information concerning grammatical category. A dictionary analysis revealed clear probabilistic, orthographic (non-morphological) cues to grammatical category at the beginnings of disyllabic English words. Moreover, native speakers were sensitive to the presence of these cues in carefully constructed non words when asked to assign stress and construct sentences: Noun-like non words were used as nouns and assigned trochaic stress more often than verb-like non words, which were used more often as verbs and assigned iambic stress. The authors concluded that English orthography does contain cues for both grammatical category and lexical stress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Using found data, we examine the productivity of a range of grammatical classes across Dutch, English, and German. The study bases its analysis on the lexical concept of precipitation. The perceptual and universal nature of such a concept should be a best-case scenario for the iconic motivation of grammatical classes. However, despite this, the test case produces mixed results.

Abstract = {Can infants use the syntactic context of an unknown word to infer that it is a verb, and thus refers to an action? Twenty-three-month-old French infants watching a moving object were taught novel verbs, within sentences that contained only function words (e.g. 'il poune par là' / 'it's pooning there'). Infants then watched two instances of the object undergoing either the familiar or a novel action and were asked to point towards the screen matching the novel verb. Infants correctly pointed more often towards the familiar action. To check that they did not simply perseverate in pointing at the familiar scene, control infants were taught novel nouns on the same visual stimuli (e.g. 'un poune est là' / 'a poon is here'). Contrary to verb-learning infants, noun-learning infants pointed more often to the novel action. These results confirm the hypothesis that function words, and more generally syntactic structure, support early lexical acquisition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We describe five patients with corticobasal degeneration who had apraxia with an ideational component and reduced action/verb naming ability. Patients also had difficulty in a series of tasks devised to explore the conceptual representation of actions associated with manipulable objects, such as action recognition, action miming and pantomime recognition; however, their ability to name manipulable objects was comparatively preserved. According to the current interpretation of ideational apraxia [De Renzi, E., & Lucchelli, F. (1988). Ideational apraxia. Brain, 111, 1173-1185] we considered the patients' apraxic disorder as the motor expression of decay of the action representation and we hypothesized that this may also have contributed to the action-naming deficit. The results are discussed within a 'multimodal model' of semantic memory in which the concept of action is seen as the product of the integration between sensorial and motor attributes. We suggest that corticobasal degeneration might offer a unique opportunity to validate this model because it is typically characterized by a frontoparietal damage [Gibb, W. R., Luthert, P. J., & Marsden, C. D. (1989). Corticobasal degeneration. Brain, 1, 1171-1192] that prevents integration of sensory and motor information. We conclude that the selective impairment of action/verb should also be studied from the point of view of a movement disorder and not only in terms of a lexical-semantic deficit.

Abstract = {We examined the implicit acquisition and mental representation of a novel verb in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients were exposed to the new verb in a naturalistic manner as part of a simple picture story. We probed grammatical, semantic and thematic matrix knowledge of the verb soon after presentation and again 1 week later. We found partial verb acquisition that was retained over 1 week. AD patients did not differ from controls in their acquisition and retention of a new verb's major grammatical subcategory, although they acquired little of its semantic properties and displayed minimal acquisition of the new word's thematic matrix. Moreover, AD patients appeared to maintain their acquired grammatical knowledge over 1 week. We discuss the implications of these findings from several perspectives, including the modularity of the language processing system, the relationship between episodic memory and semantic memory, and the role of the preserved implicit memory system in AD patients' partially successful lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {This study addresses the question of why spellings determined by morphology are relatively hard to acquire by presenting a latent class model of children's acquisition of a doublet of consonants in the spelling of Dutch verbs. This spelling pattern can be determined either by a phonological rule (after a short vowel, a doublet is spelled) or a morphological rule (doublets are spelled in past-tense forms). The results show that the youngest group of spellers identified by latent class analysis predominantly used an alphabetic strategy. They did not spell doublets at all. The latent class model further shows that the acquisition of phonologically determined spellings occurred at a lower average age than the acquisition of morphologically determined spellings. The latter led to overgeneralizations, and a U-shaped developmental pattern was found as a consequence of these overgeneralizations. Children overgeneralized doublets for different reasons. At younger ages, overgeneralizations of doublets occurred because children treated the doublet as a phonological alternative to the singleton, whereas at older ages, overgeneralizations of doublets were confined to homophones, indicating lexical effects.

Abstract = {Words associated with perceptually salient, highly imageable concepts are learned earlier in life, more accurately recalled, and more rapidly named than abstract words (R. W. Brown, 1976; Walker & Hulme, 1999). Theories accounting for this concreteness effect have focused exclusively on semantic properties of word referents. A novel possibility is that word structure may also contribute to the effect. We report a corpus-based analysis of the phonological and morphological structures of a large set of nouns with imageability ratings (N = 2,023). High- and low-imageability nouns differed by length, etymology, prosody, affixation, phonological neighborhood density, and rates of consonant clustering. On average, nouns denoting abstract concepts were longer, more derivationally complex, and emerged in English from a different distribution of languages than did concrete nouns. We address implications for interactivity of word form and meaning as pertain to theories of word concreteness, lexical acquisition, and word processing.

Abstract = {Disturbed comprehension of complex noncanonical sentences in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been linked to dopamine depletion and delayed lexical retrieval. The aim of the present study was to replicate findings of delayed lexical activation in PD patients with noncanonical sentence processing difficulties, and investigate the influence of dopamine depletion on these changes to lexical access. In the first experiment, 20 patients with PD (tested whilst 'on' dopaminergic medication) and 23 controls participated in a list priming experiment. In this paradigm, stimuli are presented as a continuous list of words/nonwords, and semantic priming effects were measured across inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 500 ms, 1000 ms and 1500 ms, with data analyzed using multivariate analyses of variance. The results revealed longer delays in lexical activation for PD patients with poor comprehension of noncanonical sentences, suggesting that the speed of lexical access may be compromised in PD, and that this feature may contribute to certain sentence-comprehension difficulties. In the second experiment, 7 patients with PD who participated in the first experiment, performed the same lexical decision task while 'off their dopaminergic medication. Semantic priming effects were measured across ISIs of 500 ms and 1500 ms. Within group comparisons revealed a different pattern of semantic priming for the PD patients when 'on' compared to 'off medication, providing further support for a dopaminergic influence on the speed of information processing and lexical activation.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to address the effect of objective age of acquisition (AoA) on picture-naming latencies when different measures of frequency (cumulative and adult word frequency) and frequency trajectory are taken into account. A total of 80 Spanish participants named a set of 178 pictures. Several multiple regression analyses assessed the influence of AoA, word frequency, frequency trajectory, object familiarity, name agreement, image agreement, image variability, name length, and orthographic neighbourhood density on naming times. The results revealed that AoA is the main predictor of picture-naming times. Cumulative frequency and adult word frequency (written or spoken) appeared as important factors in picture naming, but frequency trajectory and object familiarity did not. Other significant variables were image agreement, image variability, and neighbourhood density. These results (a) provide additional evidence of the predictive power of AoA in naming times independent of word-frequency and (b) suggest that image variability and neighbourhood density should also be taken into account in models of lexical production.

Abstract = {Goals: Research with lateralized word presentation has suggested that strong ('close') and weak ('remote') semantic associates are processed differently in the left and right cerebral hemispheres [e.g., Beeman, M. j., & Chiarello, C. (1998). Complementary right- and left-hemisphere language comprehension. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 7(1), 2-8]. Recently, this hypothesis has been challenged [Coney, J. (2002). The effect of associative strength on priming in the cerebral hemispheres. Brain and Cognition, 50(2), 234-241]. We predicted that foveal presentation of strong and weak associates would elicit different patterns of hemispheric activity, as indexed by high-density event-related brain potentials (ERPs), and that source localization of the scalp potentials would help clarify the nature of hemispheric contributions to semantic organization. Methods: 128-channel ERPs were recorded in two experiments as subjects performed a lexical decision task. Word trials were equally divided into strongly related, weakly related, and unrelated word pairs. All words were foveally presented. SOA was 800ms in Experiment 1, and 200ms in Experiment 2. Results: Topographic analyses revealed medial frontal (MFN) and parietal (N400/LPC) effects for both strong and weak associates. Between ∼450 and 550 ms, the magnitude of the N400/LPC effect indicated priming for both strong and weak associates over left parietal sites, while priming over right parietal sites was restricted to strongly related word pairs. During this interval, spatiotemporal source modeling showed that these scalp effects were best accounted for by ipsilateral sources in the medial temporal lobe. The observed pattern of asymmetries for strong versus weak associates is not consistent with certain proposals regarding the complementarity of right- and left-hemisphere contributions to semantics. It is, however, consistent with findings from visual half-field studies (Hasbrooke and Chiarello, 1998). We discuss the relevance of these results for theories of hemispheric asymmetry and meta-control in lexical semantic access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to differentiate effects of phonotactic probability, the likelihood of occurrence of a sound sequence, and neighborhood density, the number of words that sound similar to a given word, on adult word learning. A second purpose was to determine what aspect of word learning (viz., triggering learning, formation of an initial representation, or integration with existing representations) was influenced by each variable. Method: Thirty-two adults were exposed to 16 nonwords paired with novel objects in a story context. The nonwords orthogonally varied in phonotactic probability and neighborhood density. Learning was measured following 1, 4, and 7 exposures in a picture-naming task. Partially correct (i.e., 2 of 3 phonemes correct) and completely correct responses (i.e., 3 of 3 phonemes correct) were analyzed together and independently to examine emerging and partial representations of new words versus complete and accurate representations of new words. Results: Analysis of partially correct and completely correct responses combined showed that adults learned a lower proportion of high-probability nonwords than low-probability nonwords (i.e., high-probability disadvantage) and learned a higher proportion of high-density nonwords than low-density nonwords (i.e., high-density advantage). Separate analysis of partially correct responses yielded an effect of phonotactic probability only, whereas analysis of completely correct responses yielded an effect of neighborhood density only. Conclusions: These findings suggest that phonological and lexical processing influence different aspects of word learning. In particular, phonotactic probability may aid in triggering new learning, whereas neighborhood density may influence the integration of new lexical representations with existing representations.

Abstract = {We compared a group of Down syndrome participants with a group of normally developing children matched on mental age in a lexical learning task. Participants had to learn the name of four unfamiliar animals or musical instruments. Training was assessed through a naming and a pointing task, immediately after the end of the training phase, two days later, or two weeks later. Results revealed that participants with Down syndrome were better than the control group in the naming (production) task. We conclude that the learning processes involved in a novel name-learning task are not impaired in the Down syndrome persons. The two groups used the contextual cues in the same way. Finally, the notion of fast mapping in lexical learning is also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A word-finding difficulty is a language disorder whereby an individual knows the word he wants to use but is sporadically unable to retrieve it. It corresponds to a pathological increase of having a word on the 'tip of the tongue' because it occurs quite frequently and for relatively common words. This type of deficit may appear in adults but also in children. Even though the notion of word-finding disorder is well established for adults, it is less acknowledged for children. This paper presents the characteristics of word-finding disorders and discusses the hypotheses on the origin of this disorder in children, taken into account actual findings on lexical access in adults and also specificities about lexical development.

Abstract = {Motivated by the demonstration of similarly localized adaptation of the hemodynamic response in a first (L1) and second (L2) language, this study examined event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to spoken words in L1 and L2 in 15 English-French bilinguals. We examined whether the temporal pattern of N400 adaptation due to within-language repetitions (i.e., repetition priming) was similar in L1 and L2 and whether the release from adaptation elicited by a within-language word change was similar. Furthermore, using word changes across language, we examined the phonological mismatch negativity (PMN) and N400 components to determine the kind of information activated during translation priming. In contrast to within-language repetition, we expected between-language repetition (i.e., translations) to be characterized by conceptual rather than lexical/phonological word form priming. Overall, the pattern of adaptation and release from adaptation was similar in L1 and L2, with evidence of delayed semantic analysis in L2 in the form of a later N400 effect. A change in language (L1 to L2) elicited a similar pattern of PMN and N400 activity compared to a within-language change in meaning in L1, suggesting that neither word form nor conceptual information was available on-line for the forward translation. In contrast, the presence of strong PMN but minimal N400 effects for L2-to-L1 translations suggests that conceptual but not phonological information is available on-line for backwards translation. L2 proficiency influenced the extent to which conceptual representations were activated by translations. These data are discussed in light of current models of bilingual word processing and suggest modality differences in the pattern of activation of lexical and conceptual information.

Abstract = {A large number of Chinese characters are made up by pairing a semantic radical and a phonetic radical. The phonetic radical usually gives a phonological clue for the pronunciation of the whole character but does not contribute to its meaning. Using an event-related potential (ERP) measurement, the present study was able to trace the very intricate interplay between phonological and semantic information embedded in the phonetic radical. It was found that, within the first 50 to 100 ms of perceiving the character, the semantic information of the phonetic radical was better preserved when the constituent phonetic radical provided a valid phonological clue (e.g., regular phonogram) than when it contained an invalid phonetic cue (e.g., irregular phonogram). However, no trace of semantic information from the phonetic radical was preserved after 300 ms. These ERP results detail the neuropsychological steps in reading Chinese and support the framework of the lexical constituent model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Stimuli were constructed to represent 2 broad categories consisting of 3 narrow categories each. Objects representing the same narrow or broad category were presented with either a labelling or non-labelling phrase in a modified word extension procedure. Only infants in the narrow category-level condition who heard labelling phrases demonstrated categorization, and categorization performance in the narrow label condition was superior to that in the narrow no-label condition. Consistent with studies utilizing conventional objects, results indicate that object naming can facilitate infants' formation of novel object categories early in the process of lexical acquisition.

The data clearly suggest that word class type affects test results: nouns elicit a higher proportion of paradigmatic responses than verbs and adjectives. The influence of word class on test results is discussed in terms of the acquisition and semantic organisation of nouns, verbs and adjectives. However, results also show a surprising majority of syntagmatic responses in the L1 test. These results lead to a critical discussion of the concept of the syntagmatic-paradigmatic shift, which in the light of the test results in this study is seriously challenged.

The aim was to identify prognostic indicators that were associated with the reading impairments observed in an earlier study of these children. In comparison to a control group of at-risk children who were normal readers at age 10, three of the four dyslexic children exhibited either stagnation or a decline in speech accuracy in the presence of a vocabulary growth spurt at age 2-3 years. Skills in phonological awareness seemed to vary inconsistently with both early speech development and emergent literacy across the four cases. Delayed development in emergent literacy turned out to be the most potent prognostic indicator of later reading disorders. The study was guided by lexical restructuring theories of dyslexia.

Abstract = {Morphology is one of the organizing principles of the mental lexicon. It is especially important in Hebrew, where word structure expresses a rich array of semantic notions. This study investigated the ability of Hebrew-speaking children to solve written morphological analogies by reading and completing two sets of real and invented root and pattern-related nouns using a closed set of responses. In the first experiment, 152 gradeschoolers (2nd-6th grade) were administered an analogy task with real words, where they had to read written stimuli and elicit root and pattern components from them. In the second experiment, 148 gradeschoolers were administered a similar reading task with pseudowords. In both experiments, the results clearly indicate an early and robust ability of Hebrew-speaking children to perform morphological analogies using both roots and patterns. Most errors involved the root morpheme rather than the pattern morpheme, but pseudowords elicited more pattern errors. These results are discussed in view of models of morphological processing and morpho-lexical development in Hebrew. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We examined associative priming of words (e.g., TOAD) and pseudohomophones of those words (e.g., TODE) in lexical decision. In addition to word frequency effects, reliable base-word frequency effects were observed for pseudohomophones: Those based on high-frequency words elicited faster and more accurate correct rejections. Associative priming had disparate effects on high- and low-frequency items. Whereas priming improved performance to high-frequency pseudohomophones, it impaired performance to low-frequency pseudohomophones. The results suggested a resonance process, wherein phonologic identity and semantic priming combine to undermine the veridical perception of infrequent items. We tested this hypothesis in another experiment by administering a surprise recognition memory test after lexical decision. When asked to identify words that were spelled correctly during lexical decision, the participants often misremembered pseudohomophones as correctly spelled items. Patterns of false memory, however, were jointly affected by base-word frequencies and their original responses during lexical decision. Taken together, the results are consistent with resonance accounts of word recognition, wherein bottom-up and top-down information sources coalesce into correct, and sometimes illusory, perception. The results are also consistent with a recent lexical decision model, REM-LD, that emphasizes memory retrieval and top-down matching processes in lexical decision.

The deficit concerned the lexical-semantic representation of body parts and was most severe for limbs. The ability to gesture was spared and action naming was not more impaired than object naming. On the basis of normal naming latencies, we conclude that limbs are the most vulnerable component of the overall category of body parts. This vulnerability is not explained by unbalanced nuisance variables. More cognitive effort is probably required for the appropriate differentiation of limbs during semantic processing and lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study compared performance of children on 2 tests of nonword repetition to investigate the factors that may contribute to the well-documented nonword repetition deficit in specific language impairment (SLI). Method: Twelve children with SLI age 7 to 11 years, 12 age-matched control children, and 12 control children matched for language ability completed 2 tests of nonword repetition: the Children's Test of Nonword Repetition (CNRep) and the Nonword Repetition Test (NRT). Results: The children with SLI performed significantly more poorly on both tests than typically developing children of the same age. The SLI group was impaired on the CNRep but not the NRT relative to younger children with similar language abilities when adjustments were made for differences in general cognitive ability. The children with SLI repeated the lengthiest nonwords and the nonwords containing consonant clusters significantly less accurately than the control groups. Conclusion: The evidence suggests that the nonword repetition deficit in SLI may arise from a number of factors, including verbal short-term memory, lexical knowledge, and output processes.

Abstract = {Many models of spoken word recognition posit the existence of lexical and sublexical representations, with excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms used to affect the activation levels of such representations. Bottom-up evidence provides excitatory input, and inhibition from phonetically similar representations leads to lexical competition. In such a system, long words should produce stronger lexical activation than short words, for 2 reasons: Long words provide more bottom-up evidence than short words, and short words are subject to greater inhibition due to the existence of more similar words. Four experiments provide evidence for this view. In addition, reaction-time-based partitioning of the data shows that long words generate greater activation that is available both earlier and for a longer time than is the case for short words. As a result, lexical influences on phoneme identification are extremely robust for long words but are quite fragile and condition-dependent for short words. Models of word recognition must consider words of all lengths to capture the true dynamics of lexical activation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We examined the effect of the number of possible words in a word completion task on left superior temporal activity using magnetoencephalography. If this area is involved in access to phonological word representations, as assumed in dual-route models of reading, its activation for word fragments having many possible words (Many condition) would be greater than for fragments with one possible word (Single condition). Left superior temporal activity did not differ in strength between the conditions, while behavioral data suggested multiple accesses in the Many condition. Activation was shorter in the Many than in the Single condition, probably owing to bigram frequency difference. These results are inconsistent with the view that the left superior temporal area is related to lexical-route processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The effect of words with similar orthography on visual word recognition is known as the orthographic neighborhood effect. This study introduces two experiments developed to investigate this effect, conducted on university student speakers of Brazilian Portuguese. The first experiment conducted a lexical decision task of the Go/No-Go type, controlling the lexical activation index of words and pseudo-words, and observing an inhibitory effect of the number of neighbors ('N') and the number of neighbors of greater frequency than the target word ('NF'). The second experiment conducted a lexical decision task under a time-limit, encouraging strategic processing and observing a facilitative effect of 'N' in visual word recognition. Current models of word recognition were evaluated in light of these data, with the conclusion that the data best support models proposing a competition among lexical units.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that people's preference of the word order of Japanese sentences correlates with meanings that cannot be reduced to meanings of head verbs. For this purpose, we conducted two experiments to compare two groups of sentences with different 'supra-lexical' meanings (of 'caused motion' and 'caused possession'), with respect to the different configurations of case-marking particles, or case-markers, -ga, -ni, and -wo. In the experiments, participants were presented phrases (NPs and a verb) which made a sentence in a random order. After a short delay, the participants were required to recall and speak out the learned phrases in a natural sentence format. In Experiment 1, 20 caused possession and 20 caused movement sentences were prepared for the experimental materials. All the sentence including nominals marked by -ga, -ni, and -wo. The nouns and verbs in the total of 40 sentences were all different. In Experiment 2, 16 pairs of sentences which had a same verb but had different constructional meanings were prepared for the caused motion and possession sentences. The results of the two experiments showed that the participants recalled the phrases in the order of 'N-ga N-wo N-ni V' for the caused motion sentences more often than for the caused possession sentences in both of two experiments. These results suggest that, while there is an overall tendency for Japanese speakers to prefer 'N-ga N-ni N-wo V' order to 'N-ga N-wo N-ni V' order, the strength of the preference is not constant among different supra-lexical meanings.

Abstract = {The 'hard problem' in bilingual lexical access arises when translation-equivalent lexical representations are activated to roughly equal levels and, thus, compete equally for lexical selection. The language suppression hypothesis (D. W. Green, 1998) solves this hard problem through the suppression of lexical representations in the nontarget language. Following from this proposal is the prediction that lexical selection should take longer on a language switch trial because the to-be-selected representation was just suppressed on the previous trial. Inconsistent with this prediction, participants took no longer to name pictures in their dominant language on language switch trials than they did on nonswitch trials. These findings indicate that nontarget lexical representations are not suppressed. The authors suggest that these results undermine the viability of the language suppression hypothesis as a possible solution to the hard problem in bilingual lexical access.

Abstract = {This paper investigates the degree of parallelism between the distribution of parts-of-speech classes in a language, and the distribution of dependent clause types in that language. It is hypothesized that languages with parts-of-speech classes that are specialized for a certain syntactic function have dependent clause types that are also confined to a single function. Conversely, in languages with a class of lexical items that is not specialized for a single function, but can rather be used in two or more functions, the same functional flexibility is expected in the domain of dependent clauses. These predictions are tested on a pilot sample of 12 languages, each with a different parts-of-speech system. For languages with functionally specialized parts-of-speech classes the results are as expected: their dependent clauses are also specialized. The languages with flexible parts-of-speech systems partly support the hypothesis: as expected, they have dependent clause types that can be used in more than one function. However, the distribution of these flexible constructions is not exactly the same as the distribution of the flexible parts-of-speech classes. Furthermore, in addition to flexible dependent clause types, languages with flexible parts-of-speech systems have functionally specialized dependent clause types. The results are interpreted as indicative of the interdependency between lexical and morphosyntactic typology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Lexical availability measures the ease with which a word can be generated as a member of a given category. It has been developed by linguistic studies aimed, among other things, at devising a rational basis for selecting words for inclusion in dictionaries. The measure accounts for the number of people who generated a given word as a member of a designated semantic category and the position in which they produce the word. We present an analysis of lexical availability from a cognitive perspective. Data were analysed for Spanish speakers generating words from five semantic categories--clothes, furniture, body parts, animals, and intelligence. Six properties of words were investigated as potential predictors of lexical availability. Predictors were concept familiarity, typicality, imageability, age of acquisition, word frequency, and word length. Categories differed on these variables, and regression analysis found concept familiarity, typicality, and age of acquisition to be significant predictors of lexical availability. The cognitive basis of these findings and the practical consequences of selecting words on the basis of lexical availability are considered.

Abstract = {Purpose: To study the role of visual perception of phonemes in visual perception of sentences and words among normal-hearing individuals. Method: Twenty-four normal-hearing adults identified consonants, words, and sentences, spoken by either a human or a synthetic talker. The synthetic talker was programmed with identical parameters within phoneme groups, hypothetically resulting in simplified articulation. Proportions of correctly identified phonemes per participant, condition, and task, as well as sensitivity to single consonants and clusters of consonants, were measured. Groups of mutually exclusive consonants were used for sensitivity analyses and hierarchical cluster analyses. Results: Consonant identification performance did not differ as a function of talker, nor did average sensitivity to single consonants. The bilabial and labiodental clusters were most readily identified and cohesive for both talkers. Word and sentence identification was better for the human talker than the synthetic talker. The participants were more sensitive to the clusters of the least visible consonants with the human talker than with the synthetic talker. Conclusions: It is suggested that ability to distiguish between clusters of the least visually distinct phonemes is important in speechreading. Specifically, it reduces the number of candidates, and thereby facilitates lexical identification. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Over the course of acquiring deverbal compounds like truck driver, English-speaking children pass through a stage when they produce ungrammatical compounds like drive-truck. These errors have been attributed to canonical phrasal ordering (Clark, Hecht & Mulford, 1986). In this study, we compared British and Canadian children's compound production. Both dialects have the same phrasal ordering but some different lexical items (e.g. answer-phone exists only in British English). If influenced by these lexical differences, British children would produce more ungrammatical Verb-Object (VO) compounds in trying to produce the more complex deverbal (Object-Verb-er) than the Canadian children. 36 British children between the ages of 3; 6 and 5; 6 and 36 age-matched Canadian children were asked to produce novel compounds (like sun juggler). The British children produced more ungrammatical compounds and fewer grammatical compounds than the Canadian children. We argue that children's errors in deverbal compounds may be due in part to competing lexical structures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {General agreement exists that dorsal aspects of the temporal lobe support the perception of speech but there is less agreement regarding the mapping between levels of speech processing and neural regions within the dorsal temporal lobe. The present experiment sought to identify temporal lobe regions that support one such level, namely, lexical-phonological representation/processing. To do this, we manipulated phonological neighborhood density, a variable that affects processing within lexical-phonological networks. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, 10 participants listened to blocks of either high-density or low-density words. High-density words produced significantly more activation in the posterior half of the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally, suggesting that these regions are involved in lexical-phonological processing networks.

Abstract = {In this longitudinal study we analyse the early phases of reading development in Italian and explore the transition from phonological to lexical reading. A group of 28 Italian children was tested in four phases. Language and cognitive skills were first assessed in the preschool. Reading performance was then tested in three different sessions, in grade 1 and 2, using off-line naming tasks. To identify lexical reading we included in our test Italian words that have atypical stress assignment and can be pronounced with fluent prosody only by using lexical look up. Our findings show that phonological reading develops from aloud conversion of small orthographic units (e.g., single graphemes) to aloud conversion of whole strings. Such development underlies a systematic expansion of lexical reading. Children who deployed lexical reading for a low percentage of words at the end of grade 2 were likely to rely on grapheme by grapheme conversion still at the end of grade 1. Phonological, lexical, visual attention, and orthographic memory skills contribute to the systematic development of lexical reading. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: To clinically characterize performance on the Hooper Visual Organization Test (HVOT) among participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to identify naming and executive functioning correlates associated with HVOT performance among MCI participants and normal controls (NC). Background: The HVOT is a common neuropsychological instrument that measures visuospatial skills and agnosia. It has, however, been criticized for its multifactorial nature, as several studies have reported executive or language correlates of HVOT performance. To our knowledge, simultaneous comparison of executive functioning and language demands of the HVOT has never been performed among an older cohort. Methods: The HVOT, two tests of executive functioning [Trail Making Test, Part B (TMT-B), Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA)] and two tests of naming [abbreviated Boston Naming Test (BNT), Animal Naming] were administered to 222 NC, 166 MCI, and 68 Alzheimer's disease (AD) individuals. Results: HVOT scores were significantly different between all three groups in the expected direction (AD<MCI< NC). Linear regression among NC participants revealed that COWA, age, and BNT were significantly associated with HVOT scores, accounting for 12%, 6%, and 4% of HVOT variance, respectively. Among MCI participants, the BNT accounted for 43% of HVOT variance. Neither TMT-B nor Animal Naming was a significant predictor for either group. Conclusion: Among NC participants, rapid word generation (i.e., COWA), a measure of executive functioning, is the most salient predictor of HVOT performance. In contrast, lexical retrieval (i.e., BNT) is the most salient language or executive functioning predictor of HVOT performance among MCI participants. These findings extend previous claims that the HVOT is multifactorial by suggesting that reduced HVOT performance in MCI patients may be related to mild lexical retrieval impairments.

In this descriptive study we investigate anomalous vocabulary use in a 70,000-word corpus of conversational autistic language and examine evidence that concept formation, and hence vocabulary, is abnormal in autism. Particular attention is paid to the expression of artifact and temporal concepts which some believe may develop abnormally in autism. Little evidence is found of anomalous use of artifact terms, though errors with temporal (and also spatial) expressions are relatively common. We discuss why this may be and consider several potential explanations for why underlying lexical knowledge in autism may not necessarily be reflected in lexical use.

The age of acquisition (AoA) of the picture names was manipulated (25 early, 25 late). The comparison group identified significantly more objects as real than the patients. While the comparison group made very few errors in object decision, DAT patients failed to classify significantly more late than early acquired objects as real. The patients also named significantly fewer pictures than the comparison group, showing a differential impairment in naming late acquired objects. Late acquired objects induced proportionately more visual errors in the patients than did early acquired objects.

Abstract = {The present study investigated the cognitive nature of second language (L2) lexical processing in sentence context. We examined bilinguals' L2 word recognition performance for language-ambiguous words [cognates (e.g., piano) and homographs (e.g., pan)] in two sentence context experiments with highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals living in a bilingual community (Experiment 1) and with intermediate proficiency Spanish-English bilinguals living in a monolingual community (Experiment 2). To determine the influence of sentence constraint on cross-language activation, the critical words and their matched controls were inserted in low- and high-constraint sentences. In low-constraint sentences significant cognate facilitation was observed, suggesting that both languages were active and influencing processing. In high-constraint sentences, the effects of cognate facilitation were eliminated. This interaction between cognate status and sentence constraint demonstrates that sentence context can restrict non-selectivity when there is sufficient semantic information to suppress the non-target language. The fact that this interaction was observed for both bilingual groups suggests that even less proficient bilinguals, who do not communicate daily in the L2, can use context to constrain cross-language lexical competition. Implications for current models of bilingual lexical access are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Auxiliary verbs are among the most frequent words in language. The auxiliary selection is the process by which a verb selects its appropriate auxiliary in a specific language. In French language, this process is conducted when a verb is used with a compound tense form: Two auxiliaries are possible 'être' (be) and 'avoir' (have). Three types of linguistic information can influence the auxiliary selection: syntactic, lexical and aspectual. This study provided data about auxiliary selection of four aphasic patients, and four education- and age-matched normal subjects. The aphasic patients showed specific impairment of syntactic comprehension. In the present paper, the on-line sensitivity to the three constraints on auxiliary choice was tested in a word-monitoring task. The results of control normal subjects confirmed that this task showed an immediate sensitivity for all constraints. Consistent with their syntactic comprehension disorder, all aphasic patients were not sensitive to an auxiliary error when a syntactic constraint was violated. However, three aphasic patients remained sensitive to at least one auxiliary error. Two patients remained only sensitive to an auxiliary error in aspectual condition and a third patient was only sensitive to an auxiliary error in lexical condition. This finding suggests that aphasic patients can show an on-line sensitivity for some auxiliary errors. Our data are in favor of a partial independence between the three constraints. In particular, the aspectual constraint was preserved in patients who were not sensitive to lexical or syntactic constraints. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The present study analyzes the development of definitional skills in children of different age-levels and the role that metalinguistic awareness can act in the production of formally good definitions. Eighty-three children, divided into 4 age-groups (kindergartners, second graders, fourth graders, sixth graders), participated in the study and were administered two tasks: a definition task and a metalinguistic test. Results evidenced a clear age-related improvement in children's performances in both tasks. Moreover, the existence of a positive relation between metalinguistic awareness and definitional skills was confirmed and, in particular, the role of two specific components of metalinguistic competence (Concept of Definition and Lexical Awareness) emerged.

Abstract = {Behavioral research has demonstrated three major components of the lexical-semantic processing system: automatic activation of semantic representations, strategic retrieval of semantic representations, and inhibition of competitors. However, these component processes are inherently conflated in explicit lexical-semantic decision tasks typically used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research. Here, we combine the logic of behavioral priming studies and the neurophysiological phenomenon of fMRI priming to dissociate the neural bases of automatic and strategic lexical-semantic processes across a series of three studies. A single lexical decision task was used in all studies, with stimulus onset asynchrony or linguistic relationship between prime and target being manipulated. Study 1 demonstrated automatic semantic priming in the left mid-fusiform gyrus (mid-FFG) and strategic semantic priming in five regions: left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), bilateral anterior cingulate, anterior left inferior prefrontal cortex (aLIPC), and posterior LIPC (pLIPC). These priming effects were explored in more detail in two subsequent studies. Study 2 replicated the automatic priming effect in mid-FFG and demonstrated that automatic priming in this region is preferential for the semantic domain. Study 3 demonstrated a neural dissociation in regions contributing to the strategic semantic priming effect. Strategic semantic facilitation was observed in the aLIPC and MTG, whereas strategic semantic inhibition was observed in the pLIPC and anterior cingulate. These studies provide reproducible evidence for a neural dissociation between three well established components of the lexical-semantic processing system.

Abstract = {This study explores the relevance of suffix allomorphy for processing complex words. The question is whether structural invariance of the morphological category (i.e., lack of allomorphy) would affect the processing of Finnish derived words. A series of four visual lexical decision experiments in which alternatively surface and base frequency was manipulated showed that the two invariant suffixes, namely denominal -stO and deadjectival -hkO, showed reliable effects of base frequency, whereas for the two categories with suffix allomorphy, deverbal -Us and deadjectival -(U)Us, only surface frequency played a role. A further experiment showed that even with the most frequent variant of -(U)Us, namely -Ude-, response latencies were a function of surface frequency only. It is shown that neither the results from the experiments here nor previous findings from processing Finnish words can be accounted for by suffix frequency, the frequency ratio between the derived word and its base, or morphological productivity in any straightforward manner. We conclude that the lack of allomorphy, that is, structural invariance, significantly adds to affixal salience and therefore enhances morphological decomposition. The implications of this finding for models of lexical processing are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The HAL (hyperspace analog to language) model of lexical semantics uses global word co-occurrence from a large corpus of text to calculate the distance between words in co-occurrence space. We have implemented a system called HiDEx (High Dimensional Explorer) that extends HAL in two ways: It removes unwanted influence of orthographic frequency from the measures of distance, and it finds the number of words within a certain distance of the word of interest (NCount, the number of neighbors). These two changes to the HAL model produce measures of word neighborhood density that are reliably predictive of human lexical decision reaction times.

Abstract = {A relatively neglected level of lexical processing is semantics. We discuss why this might be and consider the current understanding of the influence of lexicosemantic measures on semantic processing. Two experiments examined the roles of lexicosemantic variables, including age of acquisition and word frequency, in semantic processing in young adults; both experiments required participants to identify named objects as 'living' or 'nonliving'. Age of acquisition was a significant predictor in both experiments, though just for living items. Frequency was significant only for nonliving items in Experiment 2. We discuss whether differences in classification between living and nonliving items may reflect underlying lexical differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Effects of frequency, predictability, and position of words on event-related potentials were assessed during word-by-word sentence reading in 48 subjects in an early and in a late time window corresponding to P200 and N400. Repeated measures multiple regression analyses revealed a P200 effect in the high-frequency range; also the P200 was larger on words at the beginning and end of sentences than on words in the middle of sentences (i.e., a quadratic effect of word position). Predictability strongly affected the N400 component; the effect was stronger for low than for high-frequency words. The P200 frequency effect indicates that high-frequency words are lexically accessed very fast, independent of context information. Effects on the N400 suggest that predictability strongly moderates the late access especially of low-frequency words. Thus, contextual facilitation on the N400 appears to reflect both lexical and post-lexical stages of word recognition, questioning a strict classification into lexical and post-lexical processes.

Abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of overt speech hold an important practical advantage allowing monitoring of subject performance, particularly valuable in disorders like aphasia. However, speech production is not a monotonic process but a complex sequence of stages. Levelt and colleagues have described these as roughly corresponding to two originally independent systems--conceptual and sensorimotor--that are linked in the formulation and expression of spoken language. In the initial stages a word is chosen to match a concept (lexical selection); in the later stages the sound and motor patterns are encoded and the word is uttered (articulation). It has been difficult to discriminate these stages using conventional neuroimaging techniques. We designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in an attempt to do this, by introducing a latency into a conventional naming paradigm, delaying the articulated response. Our results showed that left hemisphere perisylvian areas were active throughout, interacting with visual and heteromodal areas during early lexical access and with motor and auditory areas during overt articulation. These results are consistent with the broadest version of the Levelt model and with that derived from Chomsky's minimalist program in which a core language system interacts with conceptual-intentional systems and articulatory-perceptual systems during the early and late stages of lexical access respectively.

Abstract = {A semantic priming, lexical-decision study was conducted to examine the ability of left-and right-brain damaged individuals to perceive lexical-stress cues and map them onto lexical-semantic representations. Correctly and incorrectly stressed primes were paired with related and unrelated target words to tap implicit processing of lexical prosody. Results conformed with previous studies involving implicit perception of lexical stress, in that the left-hemisphere damaged individuals showed preserved sensitivity to lexical stress patterns as indicated by priming patterns mirroring those of the normal controls. An increased sensitivity to the varying stress patterns of the primes was demonstrated by the right-hemisphere damaged patient group, however. Results are discussed in relation to current theories of prosodic lateralization, with a particular focus on the nature of task demands in lexical stress perception studies.

Abstract = {'Winner-take-all' networks are an important theoretical construct in visual neuroscience. An implication of winner-take-all networks is that a stimulus that wins the competition for selection receives maximal activation and will be consciously perceived, even when selection was incorrect. In this study, competition was induced between physically presented ('real') and self-constructed ('illusory') words. Semantic activation was probed by recording event-related potential responses to a downstream target word. The results showed that only words reported by participants triggered a spread of activation in the semantic system, whereas non-reported words failed to prime the target. Both effects were independent of whether the potential primes were 'real' or 'illusory'. Our findings indicate that neural 'winner-take-all' networks extend to the processing of lexical units.

The second experiment yielded a lexical ERP signature for stem violations and an ERP pattern signaling morpho-syntactic (rule-based) processing for suffix violations.

Abstract = {The current experiment investigated how sentential form-class expectancies influenced lexical-semantic priming within each hemisphere. Sentences were presented that led readers to expect a noun or a verb and the sentence-final target word was presented to one visual field/hemisphere for a lexical decision response. Noun and verb targets in the semantically related condition were compared to an unrelated prime condition, which also predicted part of speech but did not contain any lexical-semantic associates of the target word. The semantic priming effect was strongly modulated by form-class expectancy for RVF/LH targets, for both nouns and verbs. In the LVF/RH, semantic priming was obtained in all conditions, regardless of whether the form-class expectancy was violated. However, the nouns that were preceded by a noun-predicting sentence showed an extremely high priming value in the LVF/RH, suggesting that the RH may have some sensitivity to grammatical predictions for nouns. Comparisons of LVF/RH priming to calculations derived from the LSA model of language representation, which does not utilize word order, suggested that the RH might derive message-level meaning primarily from lexical-semantic relatedness.

Abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of the blending portion of the Promoting Awareness of Sounds in Speech (PASS) program, a comprehensive and explicit phonological awareness intervention curriculum designed for preschool children with speech and language impairments. A secondary purpose was to examine the effects of stimulus characteristics on responsiveness to the phonological awareness intervention via post-hoc analysis. A single-subject design was used to examine treatment effects among children with varying levels of communicative abilities. The PASS blending module was implemented with 11 children with speech and/or language impairments, following the establishment of a stable pretreatment baseline on a series of phonological awareness probes. After instruction, the children demonstrated substantial improvement in their blending ability, which appeared to be attributable to the intervention rather than environmental or maturational factors. These findings suggest that PASS blending training was an effective approach to phonological awareness instruction for the preschoolers with disabilities in our sample. Additionally, word frequency and neighborhood density were found to influence performance on some phonological awareness tasks. Specifically, children correctly blended high-frequency words more than low-frequency words, but they correctly blended words from lower-density neighborhoods more than words from higher-density neighborhoods. Findings are discussed with respect to predictions of the lexical restructuring hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {To evaluate access to the cognitive representation of the meaning of words, in the present study we used the lexical decision paradigm developed by Marcos. In this situation, the subject has to recognize if the presented stimulus corresponds to a word or a pseudo-word with the purpose of building a model of normal processing. Once such a model of normal processing is obtained, the findings can be contrasted with pathologies in which semantic memory is altered. The sample consisted of 32 healthy subjects (7 men, 25 women), right-handed and with no personal or familial history of neurological or psychiatric conditions. The lexical decision paradigm employed in this study is constituted by 408 stimuli, 240 words and 168 pseudo-words. The criteria for word selection were: frequency, length, grammatical category and morphology. Electroencephalogram (EEG) monopolar recording was obtained from 19 derivations as well as event-related potentials (ERPs) for the word and pseudo-word sub-states. When analyzing behavioral aspects, subjects made more mistakes when presented with words. However, individuals with less education were the ones committing more mistakes. From this we can infer that this variable may be associated with the range of lexical repertoire. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This article presents an argument for grapheme-to-lexeme feedback in the cognitive spelling system, based on the impaired spelling performance of dysgraphic patient CM. The argument relates two features of CM's spelling. First, letters from prior spelling responses intrude into subsequent responses at rates far greater than expected by chance. This letter persistence effect arises at a level of abstract grapheme representations, and apparently results from abnormal persistence of activation. Second, CM makes many formal lexical errors (e.g., carpet → compute). Analyses revealed that a large proportion of these errors are 'true' lexical errors originating in lexical selection, rather than 'chance' lexical errors that happen by chance to take the form of words. Additional analyses demonstrated that CM's true lexical errors exhibit the letter persistence effect. We argue that this finding can be understood only within a functional architecture in which activation from the grapheme level feeds back to the lexeme level, thereby influencing lexical selection.

Abstract = {Readers' eye movements were monitored as they read sentences in which two noun phrases or two independent clauses were connected by the word or (NP-coordination and S-coordination, respectively). The word either could be present or absent earlier in the sentence. When either was present, the material immediately following or was read more quickly, across both sentence types. In addition, there was evidence that readers misanalyzed the S-coordination structure as an NP-coordination structure only when either was absent. The authors interpret the results as indicating that the word either enabled readers to predict the arrival of a coordination structure; this predictive activation facilitated processing of this structure when it ultimately arrived, and in the case of S-coordination sentences, enabled readers to avoid the incorrect NP-coordination analysis. The authors argue that these results support parsing theories according to which the parser can build predictable syntactic structure before encountering the corresponding lexical input.

Abstract = {There is a long-standing debate in the area of speech production on the question of whether only words selected for articulation are phonologically activated (as maintained by serial-discrete models) or whether this is also true for their semantic competitors (as maintained by forward-cascading and interactive models). Past research has addressed this issue by testing whether retrieval of a target word (e.g., cat) affects--or is affected by--the processing of a word that is phonologically related to a semantic category coordinate of the target (e.g., doll, related to dog) and has consistently failed to obtain such mediated effects in adult speakers. The authors present a series of experiments demonstrating that mediated effects are present in children (around age 7) and diminish with increasing age. This observation provides further evidence for cascaded models of lexical retrieval. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Background: Semantic comprehension training paired with verbal production leads to improved word retrieval in individuals with aphasia. Few studies have also examined effects of such training for word comprehension. MossTalk Words includes a training module to provide semantic comprehension training via computerised exercises. Variations in the treatment schedule may influence the impact of word retrieval and comprehension treatment gains. Aims: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Multi-Mode Matching Exercises module of MossTalk Words for improving word comprehension and retrieval in individuals with aphasia. Effects of training were contrasted for two treatment schedules. Methods & Procedures: Five individuals with word retrieval impairments associated with aphasia participated. Two had word comprehension difficulties suggesting semantic anomia, and three others with intact comprehension had impairments suggesting phonologic anomia. In a single-participant design, we investigated effects of training provided via computer with MossTalk multi-mode matching exercises (spoken and written word/picture matching) paired with spoken rehearsal. All participated in two phases of training administered 1-2 times/week and 3-4 times/week, with order of phases counterbalanced across participants. Outcomes & Results: Improvements in word/picture yes/no verification for trained and some untrained words associated with large effect sizes (d>2.5) were evident in one of two participants when trained 1-2 times/week. Increases in picture naming associated with large effect sizes for trained words were noted in 5/5 participants when trained 4-5 times/week, and in 2/5 participants when trained 1-2 times/week. Increases in picture naming for untrained words were evident in 2/5 participants in the more frequent training schedule. At 1 month post training, picture naming performance remained above baseline levels, with little difference evident between sets trained with the two different training schedules. Conclusions: Computerised lexical training exercises may lead to increases in word comprehension and production, particularly for the target words trained. More frequent training leads to greater improvements during acquisition than less frequent training, but that advantage diminishes at 1 month post treatment, suggesting that a less frequent training schedule may be just as useful as more frequent training for promoting long-term effects of lexical training.

Abstract = {Children are able to take multiple perspectives in talking about entities and events. But the nature of children's sensitivities to the complex patterns of perspective-taking in adult language is unknown. We examine perspective-taking in four- and six-year-old Tamil-speaking children describing placement events, as reflected in the use of a general placement verb (veyyii 'put') versus two fine-grained caused posture expressions specifying orientation, either vertical (nikka veyyii 'make stand') or horizontal (paDka veyyii 'make lie'). We also explore whether animacy systematically promotes shifts to a fine-grained perspective. The results show that four- and six-year-olds switch perspectives as flexibly and systematically as adults do. Animacy influences shifts to a fine-grained perspective similarly across age groups. However, unexpectedly, six-year-olds also display greater overall sensitivity to orientation, preferring the vertical over the horizontal caused posture expression. Despite early flexibility, the factors governing the patterns of perspective-taking on events are undergoing change even in later childhood, reminiscent of U-shaped semantic reorganizations observed in children's lexical knowledge. The present study points to the intriguing possibility that mechanisms that operate at the level of semantics could also influence subtle patterns of lexical choice and perspective-shifts.

Abstract = {Recent neurocognitive studies of visual word recognition provide information about neuronal networks correlated with processes involved in lexical access and their time course (e.g., [Holcomb, Ph.J., Grainger J. and O'Rourke, T. (2002). An Electrophysiological Study of the Effects of Orthographic Neighborhood Size on Printed Word Perception, J. of Cogn. Neurosci. 14 938-950; Binder, J.R., McKiernan, K.A., Parsons, M.E., Westbury, C.F., Possing, E.T., Kaufman, J.N. and Buchanan, L. (2003). Neural Correlates of Lexical Access during Visual Word Recognition, J. Cogn. Neurosci. 15 372-393]). These studies relate the orthographic neighborhood density of letter strings to the amount of global lexical activity in the brain, generated by a hypothetical mental lexicon as speculated in an early paper by [Jacobs, A.M. and Carr, T.H. (1995). Mind mappers and cognitive modelers: Toward cross-fertilization, Behav. Brain. Sci. 18 362-363]. The present study uses model-generated stimuli theoretically eliciting graded global lexical activity and relates this activity to activation of lexical processing networks using event-related potentials (ERPs). The results from a lexical decision task provide evidence for an effect of lexicality around 350 ms post-stimulus and also a graded effect of global lexical activity for nonwords around 500 ms post-stimulus. The data are interpreted as reflecting two different decision processes: an identification process based on local lexical activity underlying the 'yes' response to words and a temporal deadline process underlying the 'no' response to nonwords based on global lexical activity.

Abstract = {Developments in the understanding of the neurological and functional architectures of phonological short-term memory that took place in the 1984-2004 time period are reviewed. Phonological shortterm memory is discussed as a case that illustrates a number of issues shared by other research domains in cognitive neuropsychology, with particular reference to memory systems. Modularity: Phonological short-term memory includes two main components, an input storage system (the phonological short-term store), and an output rehearsal process. These components are functionally connected with other verbal processes and systems, such as visual-verbal short-term memory, phonological receding (grapheme-to-phoneme conversion), verbal long-term episodic memory, and the lexical systems. Neurological specificity: The store and the rehearsal components of phonological memory are implemented in discrete parts of the left cerebral hemisphere. Both the traditional anatomo-clinical correlation studies in brain-damaged patients, and neuroimaging activation experiments in neurologically unimpaired subjects, have contributed to elucidate the neural basis of the system. Converging operations: A distinctive feature of these advances has been the close interaction and cross-fertilisation among the related domains of cognitive experimental psychology and cognitive neuropsychology, based on observations in adult and child populations, in brain-damaged patients, and in subjects with developmental and genetically based cognitive disorders. Data from these different research areas have converged to specify the structure of phonological short-term memory (the distinction between storage and rehearsal) and its relationships with other memory systems (the long-term learning of novel phonological lexical entries).

Abstract = {Many facts about aphasic and nonaphasic naming are explained by models that use spreading activation to map from the semantics of a word to its phonology. The implemented model of picture naming discussed here achieves this by coupling interactive feedback with two selection steps. The model's structure and default parameters were set up to match the normal naming profile; and aphasic naming is simulated by altering 'lesionable' parameters away from default settings. Past studies within this framework have used different sets of lesionable parameters. Here, in the largest and most representative case-series ever modeled, we show the superiority of the version of the model that allows lesions to weaken semantic and/or phonological connections. Pairing this approach to lesions with the assumptions of interactivity and two-step selection equips the model to explain the wide variation in individual naming response profiles and key facts about lexical and sublexical errors.

Abstract = {Several picture naming experiments conducted in the last years show that the age of acquisition is the most influential variable on reaction times. The common interpretation given to this result is that the age of acquisition influences the lexical access process during the retrieval of the picture's name. However, recent investigations claim that the effects of that variable could be located as well at a semantic level. The goal of this study was to test this semantic hypothesis. Accordingly, three semantic categorization task experiments were carried out. The main lexical and semantic variables, such as frequency, age of acquisition, imageability, typicality, availability and familiarity were tested. In the semantic categorization tasks the only variables which predicted the reaction times were typicality, availability and imageability. The conclusion is that age of acquisition effects are located at the lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Four cognitive factors potentially influencing the perception of Spanish stress placement are examined experimentally through a nonce word perception task, and the results are considered from the perspective of their implications for a psychological model of perception. The four factors considered for a potential influence on the perception of Spanish stress placement are segmentally similar words, syllable weight, subregularities in the lexicon, and morphological category. Each of these, with the exception of syllable weight, is shown to influence the perception of Spanish stress placement. The results of the experiment probe the structure of the lexicon in a way that shows that speakers are sensitive to lexical organization, and hence provide a window into the lexical system.

Abstract = {We use a masked priming procedure to test two accounts of the picture-word interference (PWI) effect: the lexical selection by competition account (Levelt et al., 1999; Roelofs, 1992) and the response selection account (Lupker, 1979; Miozzo and Caramazza, 2003). In the visible (standard) condition, we replicated the often-observed semantic interference effect. In the masked condition, we observed semantic facilitation. We take the polarity shift as a function of masking to mean that the semantic interference and semantic facilitation in the PWI task should be attributed to two qualitatively different processes. We argue that this conclusion follows naturally from the response selection account, but only with great difficulty from the lexical selection by competition account.

The experimental findings revealed a length by lexicality interaction in reading but the absence of such interaction in lexical decision. Furthermore, the strong length effect found on pseudo-words in online naming vanished in delayed naming, so that it can not be interpreted as resulting from articulatory output generation. Similar effects were found through simulations conducted within the multitrace memory model of reading (Ans, Carbonnel & Valdois, 1998) suggesting that pseudo-word reading relies on an analytic procedure which does not apply in either word reading or lexical decision.

Abstract = {Reviews the books, Conference interpreting: A students' companion by Andrew Gillies (2001); Interpreting: From preparation to performance. Recipes for practitioners and teachers by Csilla Szabó (2003); and Interpreting: Techniques and exercises by James Nolan (2005). Andrew Gillies' slim volume is volume 2 in the 'Language and Communication' series. In his introduction, the author advises the reader that his primary purpose is to offer a compendium of exercises intended to help students make swift progress and stay motivated in their independent interpreting practice. Gillies believes that 'deconstructing' the process of interpreting and practicing the individual component skills before reintegrating them again is the most effective approach. However, he gives ample warning that the reader hoping to relate practice to theoretical or pedagogical principles will be disappointed. In combination with their class-work and other readings, this little book could certainly be a source of ideas to enhance their motivation. Csilla Szabó paints a rather glum picture of the profession. The first article in chapters are designed to provide the reader with some basic definitions, although some should be approached with caution or that sight translation is a summary of a document. The recipes themselves comprise the second section of the book. The User's Guide precedes a series of 38 exercises which are supposedly grouped around four themes. However, it would not be wise to leave students unsupervised with this cookbook in the kitchen. The most recent of the pedagogical publications reviewed here is Interpretation: Techniques and exercises by James Nolan. This book, no doubt a life's work, draws on his lengthy experience at this influential international organization at the very center of world affairs. Readers might be disconcerted by the heavy emphasis on translation to practice what is surely an oral performance art. In all, this book is no quick fix in the shape of an off-the-shelf syllabus. However, with some judicious selection and adaptation, the abundance of materials and ideas might still prove a substantial resource both for instructors to complement their own lesson plans and for students wanting to target the lexical level in their practice.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of conceptual and perceptual properties of words on the speed and accuracy of lexical retrieval of children who do (CWS) and do not stutter (CWNS) during a picture-naming task. Participants consisted of 13 3-5-year-old CWS and the same number of CWNS. All participants had speech, language, and hearing development within normal limits, with the exception of stuttering for CWS. Both talker groups participated in a picture-naming task where they named, one at a time, computer-presented, black-on-white drawings of common age-appropriate objects. These pictures were named during four auditory priming conditions: (a) a neutral prime consisting of a tone, (b) a word prime physically related to the target word, (c) a word prime functionally related to the target word, and (d) a word prime categorically related to the target word. Speech reaction time (SRT) was measured from the offset of presentation of the picture target to the onset of participant's verbal speech response. Results indicated that CWS were slower than CWNS across priming conditions (i.e., neutral, physical, function, category) and that the speed of lexical retrieval of CWS was more influenced by functional than perceptual aspects of target pictures named. Findings were taken to suggest that CWS tend to organize lexical information functionally more so than physically and that this tendency may relate to difficulties establishing normally fluent speech and language. Educational objectives: The reader will learn about and be able to (1) communicate the relevance of examining lexical retrieval in relation to childhood stuttering and (2) describe the method of measuring speech reaction times of accurate and fluent responses during a picture-naming task as a means of assessing lexical retrieval skills.

Abstract = {This article considers the exemplar theories which are independently developing in phonetics and in syntax, and argues that they jointly make some predictions that neither does alone. One of these predictions is explored in the context of two sound changes which occurred in the history of New Zealand English. We show that both of these phonetic changes were affected by phrase-level factors. The raising of /æ/ was more advanced in the word hand when it referred to a limb, than when used in phrases such as give a hand or lend a hand. And the centralization of the /I/ vowel was more advanced in utterances of give involving abstract themes (give a chance), than when it had a meaning of transfer of possession (give a pen). We argue that existence of such effects lends support both to the idea (from syntactic exemplar theory) that phrases are stored, and the idea (from phonetic exemplar theory) that lexical representations are phonetically detailed.

In formulating an alternative view, we consider both prototype and exemplar-learning models of categorization. We argue for a 'hybrid' usage-based view in which acquisition depends on exemplar learning and retention, out of which permanent abstract schemas gradually emerge and are immanent across the summed similarity of exemplar collections. These schemas are graded in strength depending on the number of exemplars and the degree to which semantic similarity is reinforced by phonological, lexical, and distributional similarity.

Abstract = {The Dutch spelling system, like other European spelling systems, represents a certain balance between preserving the spelling of morphemes (the morphological principle) and obeying letter-to-sound regularities (the phonological principle). We present experimental results with artificial learners that show a competition effect between the two principles: adhering more to one principle leads to more violations of the other. The artificial learners, memory-based learning algorithms, are trained (1) to convert written words to their phonemic counterparts and (2) to analyze written words on their morphological composition, based on data extracted from the CELEX lexical database. As an exception to the competition effect we show that introducing the schwa as a letter in the spelling system causes both morphology and phonology to be learnt better by the artificial learners. In general we argue that artificial learning studies are a tool in obtaining objective measurements on a spelling system that may be of help in spelling reform processes.

The corrected table is given in the erratum.] We examined whether mothers' use of temporal synchrony between spoken words and moving objects, and infants' attention to object naming, predict infants' learning of word-object relations. Following 5 min of free play, 24 mothers taught their 6- to 8-month-olds the names of 2 toy objects, Gow and Chi, during a 3-min play episode. Infants were then tested for their word mapping. The videotaped episodes were coded for mothers' object naming and infants' attention to different naming types. Results indicated that mothers' use of temporal synchrony and infants' attention during play covaried with infants' word-mapping ability. Specifically, infants who switched eye gaze from mother to object most frequently during naming learned the word-object relations. The findings suggest that maternal naming and infants' word-mapping abilities are bidirectionally related. Variability in infants' attention to maternal multimodal naming explains the variability in early lexical-mapping development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The process of language acquisition consists of phonological, lexical, syntactical, and social-pragmatic learning. Except for social-pragmatic learning, the first stage of language development starts with phonological learning, which involves the auditory learning of the sound system of the native language. For auditory learning in infancy, the main goal might be to acquire the phoneme system and the phonotactic rules of the native language. By the end of the first year of life, infants listen to ambient speech as sequences of word-like units. This speech-perception ability leads infants to lexical learning, which is the next stage of language development. This paper reviews findings related to phonological learning in infancy and discusses how auditory learning relates to lexical development.

Abstract = {We report an experiment exploring the extent to which the process of lexical selection in speech production is sensitive to word frequency. Participants were asked to name pictures in two sets of lists: semantic homogeneous (all pictures from the same semantic category) and semantic heterogeneous sets (pictures from various semantic categories). Naming latencies were slower for the former type of lists, replicating the semantic interference effects reported before. Importantly, the magnitude of the semantic interference effect was not modulated by the word's frequency value. That is, the effects of a fixed semantic context were similar regardless of the picture's name frequency. This result is interpreted as revealing that word frequency does not affect the ease with which lexical selection is achieved. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Producing connected speech involves coordinating the retrieval of various types of information: a) lexical items, b) its grammatical properties, and c) its phonological composition. In this article we explore these processes during the production of compound noun phrases (NPs) such as 'the dog and the car'. We report three experiments in which we investigated the scope and degree of incrementality of planning. In the first experiment, naming latencies were longer for compound NPs with semantically related items (e.g., 'the dog and the horse') than for compound NPs with unrelated items. In the second experiment, the lexical frequency of the two nouns in the NP was manipulated. The results showed an effect of the frequency of the first item, but no effect of the frequency of the second. Finally, in the third experiment, naming latencies were not affected by the phonological similarity between the two nouns of the NP. These results provide evidence for the fact that the availability of the second lexical item in this type of utterance does not affect the onset of articulation. These findings, as well as other data previously reported in the literature, are discussed in relation to the issue of the coordination of the retrieval of various lexical items.

Abstract = {This study investigated the monitoring of metrical stress information in internally generated speech. In Experiment 1, Dutch participants were asked to judge whether bisyllabic picture names had initial or final stress. Results showed significantly faster decision times for initially stressed targets (e.g., KAno 'canoe') than for targets with final stress (e.g., kaNON 'cannon'; capital letters indicate stressed syllables). It was demonstrated that monitoring latencies are not a function of the picture naming or object recognition latencies to the same pictures. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated the outcome of the first experiment with trisyllabic picture names. These results are similar to the findings of Wheeldon and Levelt (1995) in a segment monitoring task. The outcome might be interpreted to demonstrate that phonological encoding in speech production is a rightward incremental process. Alternatively, the data might reflect the sequential nature of a perceptual mechanism used to monitor lexical stress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Four experiments examined effects of lexical stress on lexical access for recently learned words. Participants learned artificial lexicons (48 words) containing phonologically similar items and were tested on their knowledge in a 4-alternative forced-choice (4AFC) referent-selection task. Lexical stress differences did not reduce confusions between cohort items: KAdazu and kaDAzeI were confused with one another in a 4AFC task and in gaze fixations as often as BOsapeI and BOsapaI. However, lexical stress did affect the relative likelihood of stress-initial confusions when words were embedded in running nonsense speech. Words with medial stress, regardless of initial vowel quality, were more prone to confusions than words with initial stress. The authors concluded that noninitial stress, particularly when word segmentation is difficult, may serve as 'noise' that alters lexical learning and lexical access.

Abstract = {Two experiments investigated sensory/motor-based functional knowledge of man-made objects: manipulation features associated with the actual usage of objects. In Experiment 1, a series of prime target pairs was presented auditorily, and participants were asked to make a lexical decision on the target word. Participants made a significantly faster decision about the target word (e.g. 'typewriter') following a related prime that shared manipulation features with the target (e.g. 'piano') than an unrelated prime (e.g. 'blanket'). In Experiment 2, participants' eye movements were monitored when they viewed a visual display on a computer screen while listening to a concurrent auditory input. Participants were instructed to simply identify the auditory input and touch the corresponding object on the computer display. Participants fixated an object picture (e.g. 'typewriter') related to a target word (e.g. 'piano') significantly more often than an unrelated object picture (e.g. 'bucket') as well as a visually matched control (e.g. 'couch'). Results of the two experiments suggest that manipulation knowledge of words is retrieved without conscious effort and that manipulation knowledge constitutes a part of the lexical-semantic representation of objects.

Abstract = {The role of segment similarity in early (i.e., partially learned) lexical entries was assessed using artificial lexicons in a referential context. During a learning phase participants heard 40 nonsense words, each accompanied by an unfamiliar picture. In testing, participants heard the direction 'Click on the [X]', and chose which of four pictures was the target (X). Target lexical items (e.g., pibo) appeared with foils that were similar: cohort items (pibu), rhymes (dibo), matched consonants (pabu) or matched vowels (diko). Two initial experiments demonstrated cohort and rhyme confusions, similar to lexical activation findings. Four further experiments explored the role of segment similarity in word confusions. Consonant-matched CVCV stimuli were more strongly confused with each other than were vowel-matched CVCV stimuli. Placing consonants in syllable-final position (VC[f]VC) weakened consonant effects and strengthened vowel effects. These results suggest that syllable-initial segments play a strong role in word similarity and constrain the organization of new lexical items.

Abstract = {To determine whether false memories cross language boundaries, we presented English-Spanish bilinguals with conceptually related word lists for five study-test trials. Some lists were heard in English, some in Spanish, and they were then followed by a recognition memory test composed of studied words, conceptually related nonstudied critical words, and unrelated words presented in the same language used at study or in a different language. Even though participants were instructed to recognize only previously heard words, they falsely recognized both same-language and different-language critical words. With practice, participants increased their accurate recognition of list words and decreased their false recognition of critical words when the study-test language was the same, and they decreased their false recognition of list words and critical words when the language differed. False memories can cross language boundaries when participants rely on conceptual representations from the word lists, but these errors decrease over trials as participants increasingly rely on language-specific lexical representations.

Reaction times were longer for pseudowords than words in LDT but did not differ in PDT. By combining the fMRI data with cytoarchitectonic anatomical probability maps, we demonstrated that the left BA 44 and BA 45 were stronger activated for pseudowords than for words. Separate analyses for LDT and PDT revealed that the left BA 44 was activated in both tasks, whereas left BA 45 was only involved in LDT. The results are interpreted within a dual-route model of reading with the left BA 44 supporting grapheme-to-phoneme conversion and the left BA 45 being related to explicit lexical search.

Abstract = {Readers construct at least two interrelated representations when they comprehend a text: (a) a representation of the explicit ideas in a text and the relations among them (i.e., a propositional representation) and (b) a representation of the context or situation to which a text refers (i.e., a discourse model). In a recent study, Long and Baynes (2002) found evidence that readers' representations were structured according to propositional relations, but only in the left hemisphere. Both hemispheres, however, appeared to represent contextually relevant semantic information. The goal in the current study was to examine further the organization of explicit text concepts in the two hemispheres. We used an item-priming-in-recognition paradigm in combination with a lateralized visual-field manipulation. We found evidence for a propositionally structured representation in the left hemisphere, that is, priming effects that reflected the linear distance between primes and targets in the propositional structure of passages. We also found that the right hemisphere represented explicit text concepts, but we found no evidence that these concepts were organized structurally. In a second experiment, we found our item priming effects reflected the representation of text information in memory and did not reflect lexical-semantic priming at test.

Abstract = {To investigate the effects of linguistic context on lexical acquisition, 192 children aged between 3 years 6 months and 6 years 6 months were introduced to 2 novel nouns in different stories. The story format provided a natural framework to vary the linguistic context in which the novel terms were introduced. Four different linguistic contexts were used: analogy, lexical contrast, implicit inferential information, and a definition. Baseline assessments were made of the children's receptive vocabulary and working memory. Children's lexical knowledge was assessed on measures of production, comprehension and semantic representations at two time points following the initial story exposure. Both children's existing vocabulary and working memory contributed to their subsequent performance at the two times of testing. In addition, the linguistic context influenced performance across the tasks, with lexical contrast resulting in the most accurate performance. In general the children found the assessment tasks where they needed to generate a contrast or provide an analogy the most difficult. However, performance was mediated by the initial exposure they experienced. The current study highlights the ways in which children's initial level of linguistic competence and lexical exposures support the development of differentiated lexical representations.

Abstract = {Purpose: This study explored the effect of frequency (number of presentations), and spacing (period between presentations) on verb learning in children with specific language impairment (SLI). Children learn words more efficiently when presentations are frequent and appropriately spaced, and this study investigated whether children with SLI likewise benefit. Given that these children demonstrate greater frequency dependence and rapid forgetting of recently acquired words, an investigation of frequency and spacing in this population is especially warranted. Method: Twenty-four children with SLI (mean age 5;6 [years;months]) and 24 language-matched control children (mean age 3;4) were taught novel verbs during play sessions. In a repeated measures design, 4 experimental conditions combined frequency (12 or 18 presentations) and spacing (all presentations in 1 session, or spread over 4 days). Comprehension and production probes were administered after the final session and 1 week later. Results: Although the children with SLI benefited significantly from frequent and widely spaced presentations, there were no significant effect in the control group. The language-impaired children showed rapid forgetting. Conclusions: The frequency and spacing of presentations crucially affect the verb learning of children with SLI. A training regimen characterized by appropriately spaced intervals and moderate repetition will optimally benefit lexical learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {At least a part of semantic priming effects observed in binary decision tasks is supposed to be caused by decision biases. A semantic relationship between prime and target could positively bias a 'yes' response, whereas the absence of a relationship would instead favour a 'no' response to the same target. We tested this assumption with a semantic categorization task in which participants were induced to associate different values--positive, negative, or neutral--to each of the categorization decisions. Although semantic priming effects were obtained even with negatively valued decisions, they were substantially enhanced with positively valued decisions, confirming the influence of a decision bias induced presumptively by a post-lexical relatedness judgement.

Abstract = {Since the inception of computer assisted language learning (CALL), computers have been successfully used to provide leaning and assessment opportunities for groups or individual learners. This article describes a use of computer that is fundamentally different to most CALL approaches, and yet contributes to language learning. While presenting a case study conducted in higher education in the Gulf of Arabia, the paper builds a strong case for computer assisted vocabulary profiling as a means of objective needs analysis and language program evaluation. This approach is based on a lexical comparison of learner corpora with the corpora of teaching resources. The software used for this purpose is The Compleat Lexical Tutor.

Abstract = {Background: In the present study neurophysiological correlates related to mismatching information in lexical access were investigated with a fragment priming paradigm. Event-related brain potentials were recorded for written words following spoken word onsets that either matched (e.g., kan—Kante [Engl. edge]), partially mismatched (e.g., kan—Konto [Engl. account]), or were unrelated (e.g., kan—Zunge [Engl. tongue]). Previous psycholinguistic research postulated the activation of multiple words in the listeners' mental lexicon which compete for recognition. Accordingly, matching words were assumed to be strongly activated competitors, which inhibit less strongly activated partially mismatching words. Results: ERPs for matching and unrelated control words differed between 300 and 400 ms. Difference waves (unrelated control words—matching words) replicate a left-hemispheric P350 effect in this time window. Although smaller than for matching words, a P350 effect and behavioural facilitation was also found for partially mismatching words. Minimum norm solutions point to a left hemispheric centro-temporal source of the P350 effect in both conditions. The P350 is interpreted as a neurophysiological index for the activation of matching words in the listeners' mental lexicon. In contrast to the P350 and the behavioural responses, a brain potential ranging between 350 and 500 ms (N400) was found to be equally reduced for matching and partially mismatching words as compared to unrelated control words. This latter effect might be related to strategic mechanisms in the priming situation. Conclusion: A left-hemispheric neuronal network engaged in lexical access appears to be gradually activated by matching and partially mismatching words. Results suggest that neural processing of matching words does not inhibit processing of partially mismatching words during early stages of lexical identification. Furthermore, the present results indicate that neurophysiological correlates observed in fragment priming reflect different aspects of target processing that are cumulated in behavioural responses. Particularly the left-hemispheric P350 difference potential appears to be closely related to fine-grained activation differences of modality-independent representations in the listeners' mental lexicon. This neurophysiological index might guide future studies aimed at investigating neural aspects of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We examine the influence of inferring interlocutors' referential intentions from their body movements at the early stage of lexical acquisition. By testing human participants and comparing their performances in different learning conditions, we find that those embodied intentions facilitate both word discovery and word-meaning association. In light of empirical findings, the main part of this article presents a computational model that can identify the sound patterns of individual words from continuous speech, using nonlinguistic contextual information, and employ body movements as deictic references to discover word-meaning associations. To our knowledge, this work is the first model of word learning that not only learns lexical items from raw multisensory signals to closely resemble infant language development from natural environments, but also explores the computational role of social cognitive skills in lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {The 'tip of the fingers' phenomenon (TOF) for sign language parallels the 'tip of the tongue' phenomenon (TOT) for spoken language. During a TOF, signers are sure they know a sign but cannot retrieve it. Although some theories collapse semantics and phonology in sign language and thus predict that TOFs should not occur, TOFs were elicited in the current study. Like TOTs, TOFs often resolve spontaneously, commonly involve targets that are proper names, and frequently include partial access to phonology. Specifically, signers were more likely to retrieve a target sign's handshape, location, and orientation than to retrieve its movement. Signers also frequently recalled the first letter of a finger-spelled word. The existence of TOFs supports two-stage retrieval and a division between semantics and phonology in American Sign Language. The partial phonological information available during TOFs suggests that phonological features are accessed more simultaneously during lexical access for signed language than during lexical access for spoken language.

Abstract = {A large orthographic neighborhood (N) facilitates lexical decision for central and left visual field/right hemisphere (LVF/RH) presentation, but not for right visual field/left hemisphere (RVF/LH) presentation. Based on the SERIOL model of letter-position encoding, this asymmetric N effect is explained by differential activation patterns at the orthographic level. This analysis implies that it should be possible to negate the LVF/RH N effect and create an RVF/LH N effect by manipulating contrast levels in specific ways. In Experiment 1, these predictions were confirmed. In Experiment 2, we eliminated the N effect for both LVF/RH and central presentation. These results indicate that the letter level is the primary locus of the N effect under lexical decision, and that the hemispheric specificity of the N effect does not reflect differential processing at the lexical level.

Abstract = {Italian polysyllabic words with stress falling on the last syllable are written with a diacritic sign on the last vowel. It allows discrimination between two words with the same orthographic segments (e.g., papa [pope], papà [dad]). The effect of the accent mark in left neglect dyslexia has never been investigated. In the current study, six patients with neglect dyslexia were asked to read aloud homographic words and non-words, with or without the accent mark. The presence of the accent improved reading performance of three patients but only with real words. In contrast, two patients ignored the accent mark, even if it relied on the right ipsilesional space. We conclude that the accent mark is computed separately from letter identity and that it can act as an important cue for lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Phonological theories have raised the notion of a universally preferred syllable type which is defined in terms of its sonority structure (e.g., Clements, 1990). Empirical evidence for this notion has been provided by distributional analyses of natural languages and of language acquisition data, and by aphasic speech error analyses. The present study investigates frequency distributions of syllable types in German, which allows for a rather complex syllable structure, and in neologistic utterances of a German speaking jargon aphasic. The findings suggest that the sonority structure of the patient's neologisms is generally in accordance with the notion of theoretically preferred syllables. Moreover, comparative analyses suggest that the predominance of the preferred syllable type is especially pronounced in the aphasic data. On the basis of these findings, the influence of sonority in impaired phonological lexical processing is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two experiments investigated naming performance for items with and without digraphs. Both experiments compared performance for Regular Consistent, Regular Inconsistent and Exception words. Experiment 1 also compared nonwords with Non-Existent Bodies to those with existing Consistent and Inconsistent Bodies. Naming was slower for nonwords containing digraphs and for nonwords constructed from Non-Existent bodies. In both experiments, the naming latency data for words showed effects of spelling-sound typicality only for words with digraphs; the speed of naming words without digraphs was not affected by either regularity or consistency. The complete set of results could not be effectively simulated by either the Dual-Route Cascaded model or by Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, and Patterson's (1996) Parallel Distributed Processing models. The absence of effects of spelling-sound typicality for words without digraphs qualifies a phenomenon that has been regarded as one of the central facts of visual word recognition and provides strong constraints on the future development of computational models of lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {Four experiments examined whether studying a single Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) list produces semantic priming for nonstudied critical items (CIs) and semantic + repetition priming for studied associates. After 30 s of mental arithmetic that followed the study of a DRM list, priming was assessed in a lexical decision task when the nonwords were either pronounceable (Experiment 1) or pseudohomophones (Experiments 2-4). Priming was measured relative to a baseline containing exactly the same CIs and associates that had not been primed by their related DRM lists. Significant CI semantic priming effects occurred in all four experiments, whether or not there was within-test priming from a related associate preceding the CI by 3-7 items. To our knowledge, these are the first experiments using standard DRM study procedures to provide a convincing demonstration of a genuine CI semantic priming effect in a delayed indirect memory test that should be free of intentional retrieval strategies. Discussion focuses on measuring long-term semantic activation effects without the influence of source monitoring in a lexical decision task.

Abstract = {The text-change detection task has been used to show that changes are more readily detected for words that fall under narrow focus than broad focus (Sturt, Sanford, Stewart, & Dawydiak, 2004), and that narrow focus appears to lead to finer semantic distinctions being held in the representation of the word. The present experiments apply the same paradigm to investigate whether sentence processing load also influenced the detection of changes, and whether under a high load, semantic distinctions are held at a more crude (rougher grain) level than under low load. Load comparisons were made through subject-and object-extracted relative clauses (Experiment 1), and through referential load (Experiments 2 and 3). Higher loads resulted in poorer change detection, but the pattern of data differed from that obtained in focus manipulations. Experiment 4 explored the effects of referential load upon comprehension, confirming that comprehension did not break down under high-load conditions. In Experiment 5, the load effect was localized to the embedded verb. These results suggest that the effect of load differs from the effect of focus on lexical processing.

The current research tests the hypothesis that the N280 effect is related to an index of grammatical complexity. We recorded event-related potentials during a sentence reading task. Comparing content versus function words revealed the classic N280. Within function words, we compared the relative pronouns 'qui' and 'que' (which are identical for length and frequency) that in French indicate a subsequent simple (subject-subject) and complex (subject-object) relative clause, respectively. A left anterior N280 effect was observed only for 'que', supporting our hypothesis that the N280 reflects grammatical complexity that can be confounded with lexical category and statistical properties.

Abstract = {To establish the relative contribution of phonological and orthographic information to visual word recognition, we varied the instruction how to respond to the pseudohomophones in a Dutch lexical decision task. One participant group was asked to base their word/nonword decisions on spelling and therefore reject pseudohomophones together with the nonhomophonic nonwords; the other group had to base their decisions on phonology and therefore accept pseudohomophones together with real words. Rejecting pseudohomophones (ignoring phonological information) was accompanied by costs in speed and accuracy for the pseudohomophones but not for other items. Accepting pseudohomophones (ignoring orthographic information) led to speed and accuracy costs for pseudohomophones and nonhomophonic nonwords that were approximately ten times larger than those for rejecting pseudohomophones. The simultaneous costs for pseudohomophones and nonhomophonic nonwords contradict an explanation of pseudohomophone acceptance in terms of a postlexical spelling check. The results indicate that phonological information can be ignored much more easily than orthographic information. Therefore, they fail to support a primary role of sublexical phonological assembly in lexical decision. This conclusion was further supported by strong effects of phonological consistency that were found in a naming experiment but were completely absent in lexical decision.

Abstract = {This study investigated how lexical access in naming tasks (picture naming, naming to open-ended sentences, and naming to category exemplars) might be influenced by different lexical factors during adolescence and adulthood. Participants included 1075 individuals, ranging in age from 12 to 83 years. Lexical factors examined included word frequency and familiarity, age of acquisition, neighborhood density, and phonotactic probability. As expected, each of these factors influenced lexical access, and there was a general trend towards less accurate naming with age. More interestingly, word frequency and neighborhood density both showed larger effects for adolescents than for adults, but then showed constant effects on lexical access throughout adulthood. Phonotactic probability showed constant effects across the lifespan. Effects of word familiarity and age of acquisition interacted with age in adulthood; lexical access of older adults was more greatly affected by a word's familiarity and age of acquisition than was the lexical access of younger adults. These lexical factors impact on adult naming so that words that were learned later in life and which are judged to be less familiar are more difficult to retrieve then their counterparts (words learned earlier and judged to be more familiar) as individuals age. This suggests that age of acquisition and familiarity may play a protective role in adult naming. In contrast, word frequency and form-based properties of words appear to have similar effects throughout adulthood. Implications of these findings for theories of aging and for models of lexical access are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {After Newman and Twieg ([2001]: Hum Brain Mapp 14:39-47) and others, we used a fast event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design and contrasted the lexical processing of pseudowords and real words. Participants carried out an auditory lexical decision task on a list of randomly intermixed real and pseudo Chinese two-character (or two-syllable) words. The pseudowords were constructed by recombining constituent characters of the real words to control for sublexical code properties. Processing of pseudowords and real words activated a highly comparable network of brain regions, including bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, superior, middle temporal gyrus, calcarine and lingual gyrus, and left supramarginal gyrus. Mirroring a behavioral lexical effect, left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was significantly more activated for pseudowords than for real words. This result disconfirms a popular view that this area plays a role in grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, as such a conversion process was unnecessary in our task with auditory stimulus presentation. An alternative view was supported that attributes increased activity in left IFG for pseudowords to general processes in decision making, specifically in making positive versus negative responses. Activation in left supramarginal gyrus was of a much larger volume for real words than for pseudowords, suggesting a role of this region in the representation of phonological or semantic information for two-character Chinese words at the lexical level.

Abstract = {Vocal reaction times were measured in Italian dyslexics and in proficient readers while they read single words. Three groups of control participants (for a total of 79) were tested. All were in the first, second or third grade of elementary school. Nine third graders with a low level of reading ability when assessed by standard reading procedures were also tested. Results indicated that vocal RTs of control participants were faster and less sensitive to word length as a function of age; also, there was a particularly marked change between first and second graders. Dyslexics' vocal RTs and errors were much worse than those of peer control participants and resembled those of first grade controls. It is suggested that normal readers in an orthographically transparent language (Italian) adopt a lexical strategy quite early in their learning. On the contrary, dyslexics seem unable to learn this mode of processing and continue to use a sub-lexical reading procedure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Children were presented with triads of dissimilar objects; all objects in a triad were labelled, two of them with the same pseudoname. Name-based categorization was evaluated through object selection. Performance was above chance level for all groups. Performance reached a ceiling at about 4;0 for the typically developing children. For the children with Williams Syndrome, performance remained below chronological age level.

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the impact of age and task context on Stroop task performance, using error scores, response latencies, and process dissociation estimates (e.g., Lindsay & Jacoby, 1994). Across three experiments, the findings showed that although older adults were able to evaluate Stroop task demands and modify their representations of task context in response to this knowledge, they were less able to maintain and update these representations on a trial-by-trial basis in tasks with high stimulus uncertainty or ambiguity. Moreover, although there was no age-related decline in the ability to modulate print color information, older adults were consistently less able to control the activation of conflicting word information. Together, these findings suggest that whereas age differences in the Stroop task may be magnified under conditions that promote transient failures to maintain task context, the primary source of these differences seems to be a more enduring decline in the efficiency of processes that are responsible for suppressing the activation of irrelevant lexical information.

Abstract = {This study examined the effects that the acoustic-phonetic structure of a stimulus exerts on the processes by which lexical candidates compete for activation. An auditory lexical decision paradigm was used to investigate whether shortening the VOT of an initial voiceless stop consonant in a real word results in the activation of the lexical-semantic network of its voiced competitor, i.e., does acoustically modified time prime penny via dime. Results for normal subjects showed semantic priming for related pairs and mediated priming for voiced competitors, consistent with cascade models of language processing allowing for interaction between phonological and semantic levels of processing. Although Broca's aphasics showed semantic priming (dime primed penny), they failed to show priming in the context of a lexical competitor. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that these patients have a lexical processing deficit characterized by an overall reduction in lexical activation.

Abstract = {At what stage does semantic priming affect accuracy in target search? In two experiments, participants viewed two streams of stimuli, each including a target word among distractors. Stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) between the targets (T1 and T2) ranged from 53 to 213 msec. A word semantically related to one or neither of the targets preceded each trial. In Experiment 1, participants were instructed to report both targets. Although more primed than unprimed targets were reported, there was no cost for unprimed words. A strong interaction between SOA and T1 versus T2 was found, but priming did not interact with either variable. In Experiment 2, only related targets were reported. Performance was similar to that for primed targets in Experiment 1. Semantic priming does not seem to modulate how attentional resources are initially allocated between targets, but instead affects a later stage of processing, the point at which a target word reaches lexical identification.

Abstract = {Patients with unilateral, right frontal lobe damage (N = 13) and matched controls (N = 20) performed a task of lexical ambiguity resolution in order to explore the contribution of right frontal regions to lexical-semantic priming. Word triplets consisting of balanced homographs were presented to participants in four conditions: concordant, discordant, neutral, and unrelated. Controls demonstrated facilitation for concordant meanings of homographs, as evidenced by their faster reaction times in the concordant relative to the unrelated (baseline) condition, as well as a lack of facilitation for the discordant meaning relative to the neutral and concordant conditions. Results in patients with right frontal lobe damage differed depending on the site of the lesion. Patients with lesions restricted to the right medial frontal lobe only showed facilitation in the neutral condition, while those with lesions encroaching upon the right dorsolateral region demonstrated facilitation of both discordant and concordant meanings relative to the baseline condition. These results support a role for the right frontal lobe in semantic priming and suggest possible specialization within the right prefrontal cortex for the processing of lexical-semantic information.

Abstract = {Patients with semantic dementia make numerous phonological errors in their immediate serial recall of words that they understand poorly. Previous studies have argued that these errors result from a reduction in the normal contribution made by semantics to the coherence of items in the phonological system. It is possible, however, that the errors might reflect additional subtle phonological deficits. Six patients with semantic dementia were tested on a variety of phonological processing and short-term memory tasks, in order to explore these possibilities. For the most part, the patients showed normal performance in phonological awareness and discrimination tasks and normal effects of phonological similarity and word length in immediate serial recall. The more severely impaired patients, however, showed some weakness on tests of nonword repetition and recall. Every patient showed better recall of words that were still relatively well understood, compared with words that were more semantically degraded. This difference extended to nonwords that were phonologically similar to the known and degraded words, suggesting that the patients' semantic deficits could account for their impairments in nonword recall. The recall advantage for semantically known over degraded items also extended to a nonverbal delayed picture copying task, suggesting that the patients' immediate serial recall impairments were underpinned by a central semantic deficit, and not by a separable lexical deficit.

Abstract = {Two picture-word interference experiments are reported in which the boundaries of the semantic interference effect are explored. In both experiments, participants named pictures (e.g., a picture of a car) that appeared with superimposed word distractors. Distractor words from the same semantic category as the word for the picture (e.g., CAR) produced semantic interference, whereas semantically related distractors from a different category (e.g., BUMPER) led to semantic facilitation. In Experiment 2, the semantic facilitation from semantically related distractors was replicated. These results indicate that a semantic relationship between picture and distractor does not necessarily lead to interference and in fact can lead to facilitation. In all but one case tested until now, a semantic relationship between picture and distractor has led to semantic facilitation. The implications of these results for the assumption that the semantic interference effect arises as a consequence of lexical competition are discussed.

Regression analyses, controlling for mothers' utterance frequencies and children's initial lexicons, revealed considerable consistency between reported and observed lexicons but changing patterns of predictive relations with development. During the first period, behavioural, but not verbal, measures of maternal responsiveness and supportive directiveness were positively predictive. In period two, verbal, but not behavioural, measures predicted children's vocabularies, with specific responsiveness and supportive directiveness as positive predictors and intrusive directiveness as a negative predictor. During the final period, mothers' behavioural and verbal responsiveness and behavioural supportive directiveness positively predicted and their verbal intrusive directiveness negatively predicted children's lexical growth.

Abstract = {Four experiments were designed to investigate whether the frequency of words used to create pseudowords plays an important role in lexical decision. Computational models of the lexical decision task (e.g., the dual route cascaded model and the multiple read-out model) predict that latencies to lowfrequency pseudowords should be faster than latencies to high-frequency pseudowords. Consistent with this prediction, results showed that when the pseudowords were created by replacing one internal letter of the base word (Experiments 1 and 3), high-frequency pseudowords yielded slower latencies than low-frequency pseudowords. However, this effect occurred only in the leading edge of the response time (RT) distributions. When the pseudowords were created by transposing two adjacent internal letters (Experiment 2), high-frequency pseudowords produced slower latencies in the leading edge and in the bulk of the RT distributions. These results suggest that transposed-letter pseudowords may be more similar to their base words than replacement-letter pseudowords. Finally, when participants performed a go/no-go lexical decision task with one-letter different pseudowords (Experiment 4), high-frequency pseudowords yielded substantially faster latencies than low-frequency pseudowords, which suggests that the lexical entries of high-frequency words can be verified earlier than the lexical entries of low-frequency words. The implications of these results for models of word recognition and lexical decision are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study investigated early lexical development in French by analysing changes and variability in lexical production and composition of children's spontaneous speech samples from three age groups: 1;8, 2;6 and 3;3 years (20 children in each). Analyses of general developmental changes showed that lexical productivity increased strongly between 1;8 and 2;6 and between 2;6 and 3;3. Changes in lexical composition mostly occurred between 1;8 and 2;6, indicating that the most important reorganizations are achieved by 2;6. The main changes observed (decreases in proportions of nouns and paralexical classes, and increases in proportions of predicate and grammatical classes) fit overall the developmental trajectories found for other languages, such as English and Italian. Two controversial issues were particularly examined and discussed with regard to cognitive, language-specific and methodological factors: noun-verb asynchrony and grammatical word explosion. Quantitative individual differences in lexical composition were greater at 1;8 than at 2;6 and 3;3, supporting the hypothesis that stylistic variation decreases in the course of the third year. Children's lexical profiles were strikingly diversified at 1;8, whereas they appeared as variants of a same 'grammatical profile' at 2;6 and 3;3. We propose that the decline of stylistic variations reflects the impact of developmental constraints, such as the necessity for children to produce function words, which suggests that variations found in the youngest children are not determinant factors for subsequent lexical development.

Previous reports have indicated that nonwords from high density neighborhoods are repeated with shorter latency than nonwords from low density neighborhoods (e.g., Vitevitch & Luce, 1998). Experiment 1 replicated these previously reported results; however, further analysis indicated an interaction of neighborhood density and stimulus duration in determining nonword repetition latency. Experiment 2 employed stimuli with reduced durational differences, finding that there was no effect of neighborhood density on repetition latency when stimulus duration was statistically controlled. Experiments 3 and 4 replicated these results with an alternative presentation regimen. Experiments 5-12 repeated these investigations with different stimulus sets, and obtained consistent effects of stimulus duration on repetition latency, and either no effect of neighborhood density or a latency advantage for low density rather than high density nonwords. The theoretical implications of these results for models of lexical processing are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Polysemy in cognitive linguistics edited by Hubert Cuyckens and Britta Zawada (see record [rid]2002-01462-000[/rid]). The book under review emanated from papers given at the International Cognitive Linguistics Conference held in Amsterdam 1997, when polysemy was very much on the cognitive linguistic agenda. This book looks at polysemy from a crosslinguistic and psycholinguistic perspective, explores polysemic networks across linguistic categories and debates psycholinguistic evidence for polysemy. Many papers in this volume explore the networks of meanings spun by polysemy in a variety of languages. But unlike traditional research into polysemy from the point of view of historical and lexical semantics, these analyses go both beyond 'words' and 'below' words, studying morphological as well as syntactical constructions, and even viewing polysemy as a systemic phenomenon. Three papers in this volume study the polysemy of lexical categories, four papers study the polysemy of grammatical categories, and another three papers look for psycholinguistic evidence of polysemy in lexical categories.

Abstract = {Background: Lexical retrieval impairments are pervasive among persons with aphasia, and a great deal of effort has been expended to develop effective treatments for these impairments. This study introduced the cueing hierarchy approach to treating impaired lexical retrieval. Aims: The purpose of this study was to develop a new treatment approach in which cues of increasing stimulus power were presented sequentially, contingent upon participant responses and to provide preliminary evidence regarding the effectiveness of the cueing hierarchy approach. Methods & Procedures: Five single-subject experiments were conducted in which persons with a significant lexical retrieval impairment participated in a treatment regimen involving the systematic use of a cueing hierarchy comprised of both semantic and phonological cues. Participants' performances were measured on both trained and untrained stimuli. Outcomes & Results: Four of the five participants achieved improved naming performance on trained stimuli and three also showed generalization to untrained stimuli. Conclusions: Although the interpretation of the results is limited by what are now recognized as significant flaws in the experimental design, the results were sufficiently robust and promising to provoke many other investigators to examine the effectiveness of the cueing hierarchy approach. Through the efforts of these investigators, cueing hierarchies employing a variety of cues have been demonstrated to be an effective intervention for a number of different aphasic lexical retrieval impairments.

Abstract = {Mathematical models of memory are useful for describing basic processes of memory in a way that enables generalization across a number of experimental paradigms. Models that have these characteristics do not just engage in empirical curve-fitting, but may also provide explanations for puzzling phenomena and may lead to new discoveries. This chapter provides a number of examples, taken from previous research with the SAM model. Although previous research has focused exclusively on the explanation of episodic memory, recent research within the SAM/REM approach has extended this model to implicit and semantic memory phenomena. This review provides some speculations on how this approach may be extended to deal with a number of basic data in implicit memory. It is emphasized that constructing a model for implicit memory necessitates the development of detailed models of lexical-semantic processing.

Abstract = {There is now considerable evidence to suggest that non-demented people with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience difficulties using the morphosyntactic aspects of language. It remains unclear, however, at precisely which point in the processing of morphosyntax, these difficulties emerge. The major objective of the present study was to examine the impact of PD on the processes involved in accessing morphosyntactic information in the lexicon. Nineteen people with PD and 19 matched control subjects participated in the study which employed on-line word recognition tasks to examine morphosyntactic priming for local grammatical dependencies that occur both within (e.g. is going) and across (e.g. she gives) phrasal boundaries (Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). The control group evidenced robust morphosyntactic priming effects that were consistent with the involvement of both pre- (Experiment 1) and post-lexical (Experiment 2) processing routines. Whilst the participants with PD also recorded priming for dependencies within phrasal boundaries (Experiment 1), priming effects were observed over an abnormally brief time course. Further, in contrast to the controls, the PD group failed to record morphosyntactic priming for constructions that crossed phrasal boundaries (Experiment 2). The results demonstrate that attentionally mediated mechanisms operating at both the pre- and post-lexical stages of processing are able to contribute to morphosyntactic priming effects. In addition, the findings support the notion that, whilst people with PD are able to access morphosyntactic information in a normal manner, the time frame in which this information remains available for processing is altered. Deficits may also be experienced at the post-lexical integrational stage of processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study examined differences in the spread of semantic activation within and between the cerebral hemispheres. A lateralised lexical decision task using indirect priming was presented to 58 undergraduates with primes and targets separated by 215 or 750 milliseconds (ms). Prime and target words were presented to the same or opposite visual fields and were either directly related (book-read), indirectly related (lion-[tiger]-stripes), or unrelated (cup-street). At 215 ms participants exhibited significant priming effects to directly related words in all conditions except when primes and targets were both presented to the right hemisphere (RH). In contrast, priming to indirectly related words was effective only when primes and targets were presented to opposite hemispheres. At 750 ms, significant priming occurred for directly related words in all conditions, and for indirectly related words when primes were presented to the RH. Results suggest that priming for directly and indirectly related concepts occurs unilaterally in each hemisphere before 215 ms. Both prime types activate semantic networks in the RH within 750 ms, whereas the LH processes information in a more focused manner. This suggests that activation spreads contralaterally from each hemisphere first to directly and then to indirectly related concepts, indicating the importance of incorporating contralateral priming contrasts in lexical decision tasks.

Abstract = {Recognition of a frequently heard spoken word variant in American English (flapping) was investigated in a phoneme identification experiment. Listeners identified the initial segment (b or p) of word-nonword continua (e.g., pretty-bretty) that was embedded in either a flap or a [t] variant carrier word (e.g., preDy-breDy or preTTy-breTTy). The results showed more identification responses forming a real word when the to-be-identified speech sound occurred in the more frequently experienced flap carrier. These results support the claim that lexical representation of spoken words includes the flap variant. Listeners do not recode the flap variant into an underlying /t/ version but recognize the flap, in its surface form, via a preexisting representation in lexical memory.

Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted using match-to-sample methodologies in an effort to model lexical classes, which include both arbitrary and perceptual relations between class members. Training in both experiments used a one-to-many mapping procedure with nonsense syllables as samples and eight sets of abstract stimuli as comparisons. These abstract stimuli differed along a number of dimensions, four of which were critical to the experimenter-defined class membership. Stimuli in some comparison sets included only one of the class-defining features, but stimuli in other sets included two, three, or all four of the critical features. After mastery of the baseline training, three types of probe tests were conducted: symmetry, transitivity/equivalence, and novel probe tests in which the training nonsense syllables served as samples, and comparisons were novel abstract stimuli that included one or more of the class-defining features. Symmetry and transitivity/equivalence probe tests showed that the stimuli used in training became members of equivalence classes. The novel stimuli also became class members on the basis of inclusion of any of the critical features. Thus these probe tests revealed the formation of open-ended generalized equivalence classes. In addition, typicality effects were observed such that comparison sets with more critical features were learned with fewer errors, responded to more rapidly, and judged to be better exemplars of the class. Contingency-shaped stimulus classes established through a match-to-sample procedure thus show several important behavioral similarities to natural lexical categories.

Abstract = {The location of phonological phrase boundaries was shown to affect lexical access by English-learning infants of 10 and 13 months of age. Experiments 1 and 2 used the head-turn preference procedure: infants were familiarized with two bisyllabic words, then presented with sentences that either contained the familiarized words or contained both their syllables separated by a phonological phrase boundary. Ten-month-olds did not show any listening preference, whereas 13-month-olds listened significantly longer to sentences containing the familiarized words. Experiments 3 and 4 relied on a variant of the conditioned head-turning technique. In a first session, infants were trained to turn their heads for an isolated bisyllabic word. In the second session, they were exposed to the same sentences as above. Both 10- and 12.5- month-old infants turned significantly more often when the target word truly appeared in the sentence. These results suggest that phonological phrase boundaries constrain on-line lexical access in infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We tested the effect of local lexical ambiguities while manipulating the type of prosodic boundary at which the ambiguity occurred, using French sentences and participants. We observed delayed lexical access when a local lexical ambiguity occurred within a phonological phrase (consistent with previous research; e.g., '[un chat grincheux],' containing the potential competitor word 'chagrin,' was processed more slowly than '[un chat drogue]' that contains no potential competitor). In contrast, when the lexical competitor straddled a phonological phrase boundary, there was no delay in lexical recognition (e.g., '[son grand chat] [grimpait],' potential competitor 'chagrin,' was not delayed relative to the non-ambiguous control). These results were observed with two different on-line tasks, word-monitoring and phoneme-monitoring. They suggest that lexical access occurs within the domain of phonological phrases. We discuss the implications of these results for models of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A series of three experiments examined children's sensitivity to probabilistic phonotactic structure as reflected in the relative frequencies with which speech sounds occur and co-occur in American English. Children, ages 21/2 and 31/2 years, participated in a nonword repetition task that examined their sensitivity to the frequency of individual phonetic segments and to the frequency of combinations of segments. After partialling out ease of articulation and lexical variables, both groups of children repeated higher phonotactic frequency nonwords more accurately than they did low phonotactic frequency nonwords, suggesting sensitivity to phoneme frequency. In addition, sensitivity to individual phonetic segments increased with age. Finally, older children, but not younger children, were sensitive to the frequency of larger (diphone) units. These results suggest not only that young children are sensitive to fine-grained acoustic-phonetic information in the developing lexicon but also that sensitivity to all aspects of the sound structure increases over development. Implications for the acoustic nature of both developing and mature lexical representations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Co-speech gestures traditionally have been considered communicative, but they may also serve other functions. For example, hand-arm movements seem to facilitate both spatial working memory and speech production. It has been proposed that gestures facilitate speech indirectly by sustaining spatial representations in working memory. Alternatively, gestures may affect speech production directly by activating embodied semantic representations involved in lexical search. Consistent with the first hypothesis, we found participants gestured more when describing visual objects from memory and when describing objects that were difficult to remember and encode verbally. However, they also gestured when describing a visually accessible object, and gesture restriction produced dysfluent speech even when spatial memory was untaxed, suggesting that gestures can directly affect both spatial memory and lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {This paper investigates the use of multi-word sequences in two important university registers: classroom teaching and textbooks. Following Biber et al. (1999), we take a frequency-driven approach to the identification of multiword sequences, referred to as 'lexical bundles'. We compare the lexical bundles in classroom teaching and textbooks to those found in our previous research on conversation and academic prose. Structural patterns are described first, and then we present a functional taxonomy, including stance expressions, discourse organizers, and referential expressions. The use of lexical bundles in classroom teaching turns out to be especially surprising, both in frequency and in function. Classroom teaching uses more stance and discourse organizing bundles than conversation does, but at the same time, classroom teaching uses more referential bundles than academic prose. The analysis indicates that lexical bundles--the most frequent sequences of words in a register--are a unique linguistic construct. Lexical bundles are usually not complete grammatical structures nor are they idiomatic, but they function as basic building blocks of discourse. In the conclusion, we discuss the implications of our study for the theoretical status of lexical bundles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Developmental differences in the neurocognitive networks for lexical processing were examined in 15 adults and 15 children (9- to 12-year-olds) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The lexical tasks involved spelling and rhyming judgments in either the visual or auditory modality. These lexical tasks were compared with nonlinguistic control tasks involving judgments of line patterns or tone sequences. The first main finding was that adults showed greater activation than children during the cross-modal lexical tasks in a region proposed to be involved in mapping between orthographic and phonologic representations. The visual rhyming task, which required conversion from orthography to phonology, produced greater activation for adults in the angular gyrus. The auditory spelling task, which required the conversion from phonology to orthography, also produced greater activation for adults in the angular gyrus. The greater activation for adults suggests they may have a more elaborated posterior heteromodal system for mapping between representational systems. The second main finding was that adults showed greater activation than children during the intra-modal lexical tasks in the angular gyrus. The visual spelling and auditory rhyming did not require conversion between orthography and phonology for correct performance but the adults showed greater activation in a system implicated for this mapping. The greater activation for adults suggests that they have more interactive convergence between representational systems during lexical processing.

Abstract = {We examined unconscious priming in a stem-completion task with both identity and form-related primes. Participants were given exclusion instructions to avoid completing a stem (e.g., ca---) with a briefly flashed masked word (e.g., candy). In Experiment 1, priming of around 7% occurred for both identity (e.g., candy) and form-based (e.g., windy) primes at a 33 ms exposure duration. When examining only trials in which the participants failed to identify the prime, this effect increased to 12% for identity primes, but remained the same for form-based primes. In Experiment 2, priming without prime identification was 9% for identity primes, 4% for homophone primes, and 3% for orthographic control primes. Although identity priming was greater than form priming in both experiments, regression analyses revealed that orthographic and phonological overlap alone between the flashed primes and targets could completely account for unconscious identity priming. Hence, we conclude that masked words may only activate their sublexical orthographic and phonological representations and not their lexical representations.

Abstract = {In this project we examined the effect of adult age on visual word recognition by using combined reaction time (RT) and accuracy methods based on the Hick-Hyman law. This was necessary because separate Brinley analyses of RT and errors resulted in contradicting results. We report the results of a lexical decision task experiment (with 96 younger adults and 97 older adults). We transformed the error data into entropy and then predicted RT by using entropy values separately for exposure duration (thought to influence peripheral processes) and word frequency (thought to influence central processes). For exposure duration, the entropy-RT functions indicate that older adults show higher intercepts and slopes than do younger adults, suggesting an encoding decrement for older adults. However, for word frequency, older adults show higher intercepts but not steeper slopes than younger adults. Older adults thus show a peripheral processing decrement but not a central processing decrement for lexical decision. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Bloem and La Heij (2003) reported that in a word-translation task context words induce semantic interference whereas context pictures induce semantic facilitation. This finding was accounted for by a model of lexical access in which: (a) semantic facilitation is localized at the conceptual level, (b) semantic interference is localized at the lexical level, and (c) only one concept is selected for lexicalization (the Conceptual Selection Model or CSM). In the present paper we report a second reversal: context words that induce semantic interference at SOA = +200 ms, induce semantic facilitation at SOA = -400 ms. The CSM simulated this finding when the additional assumption was made that lexical representations decay faster than conceptual representations. Experiments 2-5 test and confirm predictions of the CSM concerning the time course of semantic, phonological, and lexical context effects.

Abstract = {Infants prefer to listen to happy speech. To assess influences of speech affect on early lexical processing, 7.5- and 10.5-month-old infants were familiarized with one word spoken with happy affect and another with neutral affect and then tested on recognition of these words in fluent passages. Infants heard all passages either with happy affect or with neutral affect. Contrary to initial expectations that positive affect would facilitate word recognition, younger infants recognized familiarized words only when affect matched across familiarization and testing. Older infants displayed a more mature pattern of word recognition, recognizing words across variations in affect regardless of the direction of change when the task was somewhat simplified. However, younger infants continued to be limited by affective matching in the simplified task. Early processing advantages thus do not necessarily follow listening preferences. Rather, infants' early lexical representations appear to be dominated by covarying properties of experienced exemplars, whether or not these are ultimately relevant for lexical distinctions.

Abstract = {Objective: Previous work has shown that individual differences in resting alpha asymmetry are associated with efficacy on a variety of cognitive tasks. Still unresolved is how ongoing alpha asymmetry relates to behavioral asymmetry, explored here using lateralized lexical decision. Methods: Alpha power immediately preceding lexical decision trials was measured to assess cognitive engagement during word recognition. This was compared with behavioral performance for the task, measured by accuracy and latency of the lexical decision response. Results: Greater relative left hemisphere alpha power (i.e. higher asymmetry) immediately before presentation of a word led to reduced likelihood for its successful identification. Greater alpha asymmetry was also associated with reduced performance for identifying stimuli lateralized to the right visual field. Conclusions: Word recognition is facilitated by decreased asymmetry in cognitive engagement in the two cerebral hemispheres, particularly when the stimuli are lateralized to the left hemisphere (right visual field). Significance: Results address the role of cognitive engagement in the two cerebral hemispheres, and its relationship with lexical access.

Abstract = {This study investigated hemispheric lateralization of Mandarin tone. Four groups of listeners were examined: native Mandarin listeners, English-Mandarin bilinguals, Norwegian listeners with experience with Norwegian tone, and American listeners with no tone experience. Tone pairs were dichotically presented and listeners identified which tone they heard in each ear. For the Mandarin listeners, 57% of the total errors occurred in the left ear, indicating a right-ear (left-hemisphere) advantage. The English- Mandarin bilinguals exhibited nativelike patterns, with 56% left-ear errors. However, no ear advantage was found for the Norwegian or American listeners (48 and 47% left-ear errors, respectively). Results indicate left-hemisphere dominance of Mandarin tone by native and proficient bilingual listeners, whereas nonnative listeners show no evidence of lateralization, regardless of their familiarity with lexical tone.

Abstract = {This study seeks information on the mental representation of Verb-Noun (VN) nominal compounds through neuropsychological methods. The lexical retrieval of compound nouns is tested in 30 aphasic patients using a visual confrontation naming task. The target names are VN compounds, Noun-Noun (NN) compounds, and long morphologically simple nouns (LSN). In order to check the ability to produce simple nouns and verbs in the same participants, a further visual confrontation naming task of objects and actions is used. Results of the study confirm that several patients with disproportionate verb deficit are also impaired in naming VN compounds. Data are in favor of a (de)compositional processing of compound words. A further group of patients is selectively more impaired with compound nouns than with comparably long simple nouns, irrespective of their VN or NN morphological structure. It is suggested that this impairment is to be ascribed to a specific disorder in retrieving two different lexemes with a single lexical entry.

Abstract = {Form-priming effects from sublexical (syllabic or segmental) primes in masked priming can be accounted for in two ways. One is the sublexical pre-activation view according to which segments are pre-activated by the prime, and at the time the form-related target is to be produced, retrieval/assembly of those pre-activated segments is faster compared to an unrelated situation. However, it has also been argued that form-priming effects from sublexical primes might be due to lexical pre-activation. When the sublexical prime is presented, it activates all form-related words (i.e., cohorts) in the lexicon, necessarily including the form-related target, which--as a consequence--is produced faster than in the unrelated case. Note, however, that this lexical pre-activation account makes previous pre-lexical activation of segments necessary. This study reports a nonword naming experiment to investigate whether or not sublexical pre-activation is involved in masked form priming with sublexical primes. The results demonstrated a priming effect suggesting a nonlexical effect. However, this does not exclude an additional lexical component in form priming.

Abstract = {An ongoing debate in Arabic morphology concerns the nature of the smallest unit governing lexical organization and representation in this language. A standard model maintains that Arabic words are typically analyzable into a three-consonantal root morpheme carrying the core meaning of words and a prosodic template responsible mostly for grammatical information. This view has been largely supported by research in both theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics. An alternative theory holds that the meaning of words in Arabic is, rather, encoded in the 'etymon' comprising two unordered consonants of the root only. Results from a recent priming experiment have shown that the etymon induces strong morphological priming effects, supporting its morphological/ lexical status. In this paper we present data from a patient with deep dyslexia questioning the role of the etymon as a psychologically real representational unit in Arabic and arguing, instead, for the central role of the root in both morphological and lexical representation in this language.

Abstract = {PM, an adult developmental dyslexic, was markedly slower than controls in her reading speed of single words, connected text, and non-words. A remediation programme was implemented that involved repeated presentation of a set of 160 words, together with a gradual reduction in exposure time. Post-intervention testing revealed that the programme successfully increased PM's reading speed. A significant effect of word length on PM's naming latencies was observed prior to intervention but was substantially reduced following it. Naming latencies and lexical decision task latencies showed a reduction following intervention, although performance in a pseudohomophone decision task was found to be worse following intervention than before it. Finally, PM showed evidence of a 'release from competition' effect in the Paap and Noel (1991) dual task paradigm prior to intervention, but not following. It was suggested that PM's reading performance prior to remediation indicated inefficient lexical and sublexical procedures while post-intervention testing suggested that there had been an improvement in lexical processing.

Abstract = {Although Chinese speakers use the Chinese bei-construction to express a neutral or positive meaning more often than before, it seems that the main use of the bei-construction is still for expressing a negative meaning. However, it remains unclear whether the negative meaning affecting the use of bei is derived from sentence-level semantics or merely the verb's internal connotation. In this study, we selected the 10 most positive verbs, 10 most neutral verbs, and 10 most negative verbs among 140 verbs in a pretest. These three types of verbs were then put into three kinds of sentences (positive, neutral, and negative), with ten sentences of each type of verb/sentence combination. These 90 sentences were presented to Chinese native speakers, who were asked to score their acceptability. A two-way ANOVA found a highly significant main effect of sentence type on acceptability, but no effect of verb type, and no sentence x verb interaction. Post hoc tests showed that the results were due to high acceptability scores for sentences with negative connotations. Consistent with an interactive approach, the Chinese bei-construction is affected more by a higher level of semantic context than by local structural or lexical factors.

Abstract = {In the first part of this study, we investigated effects of item and task type on span performance in a group of aphasic individuals with word processing and STM deficits. Group analyses revealed significant effects of item on span performance with span being greater for digits than for words. We also investigated associations between subjects' lexical-semantic and phonological processing abilities and performance on four measures of verbal span (digit and word span, each varied for type of response, verbal vs. pointing) as well as one measure of nonverbal span. We predicted and found that the patterns of association between verbal span tasks and lexical abilities reflected the integrity of language processes and representations deployed in each paradigm used to assess span. Performance on the pointing span task, which engages both lexical-semantic and phonological processes, correlated with measures of both lexical-semantic and phonological abilities. Performance on repetition span, which engages primarily input and output phonological processes, correlated with measures of phonological abilities but not measures of lexical-semantic abilities.

Abstract = {Context of learning, such as whether a learner studies a second language (L2) in a formal classroom at-home (AH) or study abroad (SA), may be a key factor in developing grammatical and lexical abilities. Yet, little empirical data is available comparing the effects of SA and formal instruction AH experiences on such development. The scant research that exists presents conflicting results. This paper provides a multivariate analysis of the effects of learning context on grammatical and lexical abilities in oral conversational discourse. The data compare the abilities of two groups before and after studying Spanish as an L2 for approximately one semester: a SA group in Alicante, Spain, and a formal-classroom AH group at an American university. The corpus comprises oral segments produced by the learners in an Oral Proficiency Interview before and after the experimental period. In a corpus-based analysis, each segment was transcribed and tagged for various lexical and grammatical features. In two discriminant analyses, I identified various grammatical and lexical features that differentiated the two groups in terms of program gains. The results indicated that the AH context facilitated more development on discrete grammatical and lexical features. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In detail, the question to be studied is, if the frequencies with which the single words occur within a given proverb corpus, can be theoretically modelled. In other words: whereas previous studies concentrated on the length of the units to be studied (and on the frequency of their occurrence), the present study focuses on the lexical frequency structure itself.

Abstract = {In this study we discuss a new measure of the speed of written lexical retrieval in a second language, the Written Productive Translation Task (WPTT). In contrast to Picture Naming tasks, the WPTT is not restricted to concrete nouns and verbs that can be depicted by pictures. The WPTT can also test combinations of words. Using Messick's 1989 framework, we investigated whether the WPTT is an appropriate measure of the construct of written lexical retrieval. In a multiple regression approach we examined the relationship between the WPTT and another test of the same construct, a written Picture Naming task. Results suggest that the WPTT is both a reliable and valid measure of written lexical retrieval. When corrected for typing speed, the WPTT is related to the Picture Naming task and Orthographic Encoding. Finally, the results show that the relationship between the WPTT and the Lexical Decision Task is not very strong. This study makes clear that Lexical Decision Tasks do not constitute a valid substitute for measuring written lexical retrieval. At the same time it underlines the advantages of using a test specifically developed for measuring speed of written lexical retrieval like the WPTT.

Abstract = {Two procedures were used to explore the effects of semantic and grammatical gender on the recognition and processing of Bulgarian nouns, in relation to other factors that are known to affect lexical access. This study in a three-gender language was modeled on previous work in Italian, a two-gender language (Bates, Devescovi, Pizzamiglio, D'Amico, & Hernandez, 1995). Words were presented auditorily in randomized lists in two tasks: (1) repeat the word as quickly as possible and (2) determine the grammatical gender of the noun as soon as possible and indicate the decision by pressing a button. Reaction times in both tasks were influenced by phonological factors, word frequency, and irregularity of gender marking, but semantic and grammatical gender affected only gender monitoring. The significant contribution of semantic gender to processing in Bulgarian contrasts with previous findings for Italian. Also, we obtained an interaction between sex of the subject and noun gender, reflecting a bias toward one's own grammatical gender 'counterpart' (especially for females). Reanalysis of the prior study in Italian showed a similar interaction but confirmed no effects of the semantic gender of the noun, suggesting that these two natural gender effects can dissociate. Possible reasons for cross-linguistic differences are discussed, with implications for comparative studies of gender and lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Experiment 2, visual study presentations, but not auditory study presentations, led to significant priming.

Abstract = {Adults' performance on a variety of tasks suggests that phonological processing of nonwords is grounded in generalizations about sublexical patterns over all known words. A small body of research suggests that children's phonological acquisition is similarly based on generalizations over the lexicon. To test this account, production accuracy and fluency were examined in nonword repetitions by 104 children and 22 adults. Stimuli were 22 pairs of nonwords, in which one nonword contained a low-frequency or unattested two-phoneme sequence and the other contained a high-frequency sequence. For a subset of these nonword pairs, segment durations were measured. The same sound was produced with a longer duration (less fluently) when it appeared in a low-frequency sequence, as compared to a high-frequency sequence. Low-frequency sequences were also repeated with lower accuracy than high-frequency sequences. Moreover, children with smaller vocabularies showed a larger influence of frequency on accuracy than children with larger vocabularies. Taken together, these results provide support for a model of phonological acquisition in which knowledge of sublexical units emerges from generalizations made over lexical items.

Our hypothesis, which we label the Ivy Hypothesis, is that, in the interaction meant to be in the weaker language, the child uses portions of higher syntactic structure lexically instantiated in the stronger language combined with lower portions in the weaker language. Code-mixing patterns were studied in five Swedish-French/Italian children aged 2-4. The parts of the code-mixed utterances reflected as much syntactic structure of each language as was used in monolingual utterances in the same recording of each child. This uneven development, which is due to different amounts of input of the two languages, can be accounted for by assuming that syntactic structure is acquired by building each language from the bottom up through lexical learning.

Abstract = {The current study examines how patients with aphasia access the meanings of idioms during spoken sentence comprehension. In our experiment, we had 4 subjects whose native language is German: 2 left-hemisphere damaged patients (Wernicke's and global aphasia); 1 right-hemisphere damaged patient; and 1 age-matched healthy speaker. Ambiguous two-element German noun compounds carrying an idiomatic as well as a literal meaning served as target words. While listening to contextually biasing sentences containing the target words, the subjects performed a lexical decision task at the offset of each compound. All the subjects, including the aphasic patients, accessed the compounds' literal and idiomatic meanings simultaneously despite the existence of contextually biasing sentences. The data are discussed by taking account of the findings of recent studies of lexical semantic processing in aphasia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Semantic substitution errors (e.g., saying 'arm' when 'leg' is intended) are among the most common types of errors occurring during spontaneous speech. It has been shown that grammatical gender of German target nouns is preserved in the errors (E. Mane, 1999). In 3 experiments, the authors explored different accounts of the grammatical gender preservation effect in German. In all experiments, semantic substitution errors were induced using a continuous naming paradigm. In Experiment 1, it was found that gender preservation disappeared when speakers produced bare nouns. Gender preservation was found when speakers produced phrases with determiners marked for gender (Experiment 2) but not when the produced determiners were not marked for gender (Experiment 3). These results are discussed in the context of models of lexical retrieval during production. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We report the performance of two patients who presented with complementary deficits in naming nouns relative to verbs: EA performed far worse with nouns than verbs, while MR performed worse with verbs than nouns. The two patients' grammatical category-specific deficits could not easily be explained in terms of damage to specific types of semantic knowledge prototypically associated with nouns (visual properties) and verbs (action features). One of the two patients, MR, also presented with a selective deficit in processing verbal as opposed to nominal morphology, in line with her impairment in naming verbs. The other patient, EA, showed no impairment in producing nominal and regular verbal morphology. The contrasting patterns of grammatical category-specific deficits in naming and morphological processing, along with other recently reported patterns, are interpreted as providing support for the claim that semantic and grammatical properties independently contribute to the organisation of lexical processes in the brain.

To understand the origin of this bias, four experiments assessed the impact of letter font, letter size, and grapheme-phoneme convergences on perceived stimulus center. Fourteen observers indicated the perceived centers of words, pseudowords, consonant strings, and lines with a mouse cursor. Visual orthographic factors had no effect on perceived word center but grapheme-phoneme convergence did: Observers compensated for strong grapheme-phoneme asymmetries in the letter strings. These findings support the idea that the cognitive representation of words is spatially distorted as a result of lexical access mechanisms.

Speeded naming latencies were determined by a software key on the basis of the digital recording of the responses. The effects of various variables on these latencies were assessed with multiple regression techniques, using a repeated measures design.

Abstract = {This paper presents three experiments which show syntactic priming effects in four- and five-year-old children. The experiments are modeled after priming studies with adults involving transitive and dative constructions. In Study 1 children were presented with a picture that was described by an experimenter. They repeated the experimenter's sentence and then were presented with a new picture to describe. Children were more likely to use a particular syntactic form if it had been used by the experimenter. In Study 2 the procedure was identical except that children did not repeat the experimenter's sentence. Priming effects were comparable to those in Study 1. In Study 3, after hearing the experimenter's sentences, children were presented with a block of pictures to describe. Across the entire block, children were more likely to use a particular form if it had been used by the experimenter. Together these results indicate that children represent syntactic form independently of particular lexical items. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We investigated event-related potential (ERP) correlates of developmental changes in spoken word recognition during early school years. We focused on implicit processing of word onsets as this may change considerably due to vocabulary growth and reading acquisition. Subjects were pre-schoolers, beginning readers and adults. Two experiments examined phonological onset priming effects on ERP measures in an auditory lexical decision task. Primes were words (Expt. 1) or non-words (Expt. 2). ERPs elicited by words showed clear developmental changes in ERP latency and morphology, especially with regard to early negativities like the N1. Prominent priming effects were an enhanced N400 amplitude due to alliterating word primes in beginning readers, and typical phonological N400 reductions due to alliterating non-word primes in all groups. Priming further led to opposite early effects with word primes vs. non-word primes in all groups. In particular, our results indicate distinct processing of word onsets in beginning readers, confirming that vocabulary growth and the acquisition of reading may critically contribute to the formation of a fully segmental lexical system.

Abstract = {Background: The clinical symptoms of dyslexia change over the life span of the patients and the age-dependent changes in reading ability are different from those seen during normal reading development. Objective: Measuring age differences in reading performance of dyslexic and normally reading persons in tasks requiring different reading strategies. Methods: 102 patients with dyslexia and 91 normally reading controls (children, adolescents, and adults) had to read aloud material adapted for the respective age group: (1) words; (2) nonwords; and (3) a phonological transformation task. Reading performance was quantified by errors and time taken. Results: Dyslexic patients performed significantly more poorly on all three tasks significantly than did the matched controls. In both groups a significant improvement of word reading appeared with increasing age. Essential improvement of reading performance was observed in the normally reading group for nonword reading and phonological transformation only. Conclusions: The abilities of adults with dyslexia to carry out grapheme-phoneme transformations developed more slowly than in normals. Compensation of reading deficits seems to be possible by means of whole word (lexical) reading strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The functional primacy of syntactic over semantic processes was put to test in an auditory event-related brain potentials study using sentences in which the final words were semantically and/or syntactically incongruent with the prior context. Crucially, these words encoded the syntactically relevant word category information in the suffix, available only after the word stem which carried the semantic information. Semantic violations elicited an N400 and syntactic violations a biphasic LAN-P600 pattern. Words that were semantically and syntactically incongruent with the context evoked a biphasic LAN-P600 ERP pattern, but no N400. The similarity of the ERP pattern for the pure syntactic and the double violation condition provides strong evidence for a functional primacy of initial syntactic over lexical-semantic processes.

Abstract = {The article reports the case of a patient who showed a selective inability in reading multi-digit numbers following recovery from aphasic disorders. Although his ability to read words, non-words, syntagms and sentences was almost preserved, he made errors with Arabic numerals and number words. Different types of errors with alphabetic material were also observed: he made only rare phonological substitutions with linguistic stimuli, whereas errors were almost always lexical in reading number words. A series of experiments showed that his ability to access number semantics was intact. In contrast, he selectively failed in all production tasks (including calculation), but only when the required response was in the oral output modality. This pattern was interpreted in terms of a selective deficit to the spoken number name production system. Furthermore, the different types of errors made with alphabetic materials belonging to the two classes of stimuli (numerical versus non-numerical) further support the hypothesis of a categorical organisation in the lexical-semantic system.

Abstract = {This study employed the distinction between lexical and supralexical processes in reading in order to gain a more fine-grained picture of the relationships between early language impairment and later reading disabilities. We hypothesized that early semantic-syntactic deficits would be only weakly related, if at all, to the characteristically modular word recognition processes involved in reading isolated words and pseudowords. On the other hand, early language deficiencies were expected to be significantly associated with processes operating beyond the level of individual words when children are required to read and understand connected text. These predictions were tested using data from a longitudinal study of over 500 unselected children followed from kindergarten to the end of Grade 1. Both traditional categorical analyses of specific subgroups with early language impairment or later reading disability as well as dimensional (regression) analyses were carried out. As predicted, higher order language was found to be related to supralexical aspects of reading after controlling IQ, age, gender and socioeconomic status, with only a weak and statistically marginal association with lexical processing.

Abstract = {In two experiments, 42 adult readers' eye movements were monitored as they read sentences containing compound words. In Experiment 1, the frequency of the first and second morpheme was manipulated in compound words of low whole word frequency. Experiment 2 compared pairs of low frequency compounds with high and low frequency first morphemes but identical second morphemes that were embedded in the same sentence frames. The results showed significant effects of the frequency of both morphemes on gaze duration and total fixation time on the compound words. Regression analyses revealed an influence of whole word frequency on the same measures. The results suggest that morphemic constituents of compound words are activated in the course of retrieving the representation of the whole compound word. The fact that the frequency effects were not confined to fixations on the morphemic constituents themselves implies that saccadic eye movements are implemented before morphemic retrieval has been completed. The results highlight the importance of developing more precise models of the perceptual processes underlying reading and how they interact with the processes involved in lexical retrieval and comprehension.

Abstract = {Three reading comprehension experiments with 88 college students examined the effects of a typographical error in parafoveal vision on aspects of foveal inspection time and saccade targeting. A contingent presentation procedure ensured that typographical errors were restored to their correct form before they were viewed in foveal vision: They were never available for foveal processing. In Exp 1, the error was formed by replacing the first letter of the target word with a second occurrence of its second letter, producing an illegal nonword. This manipulation had no significant effect on foveal inspection time, but lowered the probability that a short word prior to the target would be skipped. In Exp 2 the familiarity of the target's initial letters was maintained constant across conditions. This manipulation removed the target 1 skipping effect, suggesting that the outcome of Exp 1 was due to orthographic rather than lexical illegality, but revealed shorter foveal inspection times as a function of the presence of the error. Exp 3 manipulated lexical and sublexical properties of the parafoveal typing error. Properties of the parafoveal error again influenced prior foveal inspection times. Results suggested that the determining properties were sublexical rather than lexical. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown large response time costs (in excess of 50 ms) when bilingual speakers switch predictably back and forth between naming items (a productive switching task) in their first (L1) and second languages (L2). A recent study using event-related potentials (ERPs) has shown that switching between languages is associated with activity over frontal (N2) and parietal (late positive complex) areas of cortex (Jackson, Swainson, Cunnington, & Jackson, 2001). Switching between naming in different languages requires a switch in both language representations and language-specific motor responses. The current study investigated a receptive (input) language-switching task with a common manual response. Number words were presented in L1 and L2, and participants were required to judge whether the words were odd or even (a parity judgement). Response costs were considerably reduced, and the frontal and parietal switch related activity reported in the productive switching task was absent. Receptive switching was associated with early switch-related activity over central sensors that were not language specific. These results are discussed in relation to the idea that there is no language-specific lexical selection mechanism... (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The diffusion model for 2-choice decisions (R.

The model gave a good account of all of the dependent variables--accuracy, correct and error response times, and their distributions--and provided a description of how the component processes involved in the lexical decision task were affected by experimental variables. All of the variables investigated affected the rate at which information was accumulated from the stimuli--called drift rate in the model. The different drift rates observed for the various classes of stimuli can all be explained by a 2-dimens;ional signal-detection representation of stimulus information. The authors discuss how this representation and the diffusion model's decision process might be integrated with current models of lexical access.

Abstract = {Neighborhood size and neighborhood frequency were orthogonally varied in two experiments on Italian nonwords. In Experiment 1, an inhibitory effect of neighborhood frequency on visual lexical decision was found: The presence of one high-frequency neighbor increased response latencies and error rates to nonwords. By contrast, no effect of neighborhood size and no neighborhood size × neighborhood frequency interaction were found. In Experiment 2, a facilitatory effect of neighborhood size on nonword naming was shown: Naming latencies were faster when nonwords had a large neighborhood. In the naming experiment, there was no effect of neighbors' frequency and no neighborhood size × neighborhood frequency interaction. An additional role for bigram frequency was found whereas syllable frequency did not give any independent contribution. These results further corroborate the view that, in a language with transparent orthography like Italian, despite a substantial contribution of sublexical print-to-sound mapping due to the language's high regularity/consistency, reading aloud of nonlexical material may benefit from the contribution of the lexical component.

Abstract = {In this chapter, we examine the lexical abilities of children with specific language impairment (SLI). These children exhibit a significant deficit in language ability, yet show no evidence of obvious neurological impairment or significant limitations in nonverbal intellectual functioning. In addition, the hearing of these children is within normal limits, and they provide no indication of serious emotional difficulties. Examination of the nature of the children's lexical limitations suggests that the children's lexical networks are organized in a generally appropriate manner at the lexical concept, lemma, and lexeme levels. However, these networks are relatively sparse, and resting activation levels of the entries and the links among entries are relatively weak. The sparse network has implications for grammar as well as for the lexicon. For example, incomplete or weakly represented information at the lemma level can lead to sentences with missing constituents. Lexical limitations--especially those pertaining to verbs--will cause problems for syntax as well. Nevertheless, a close look at the children's verb-related difficulties suggests that lexical limitations can only be part of the problem. Independent difficulties with syntax seem to exist alongside lexical limitations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Models of speech production assume that syllables play a functional role in the process of word-form encoding in speech production. In this study, we investigate this claim and specifically provide evidence about the level at which syllables come into play. We report two studies using an odd-man-out variant of the implicit priming paradigm to examine the role of the syllable during the process of word formation. Our results show that this modified version of the implicit priming paradigm can trace the emergence of syllabic structure during spoken word generation. Comparing these results to prior syllable priming studies, we conclude that syllables emerge at the interface between phonological and phonetic encoding. The results are discussed in terms of the WEAVER++ model of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Split-intransitive systems of argument marking provide an excellent opportunity to study the structure of the lexical-semantic representations that underlie argument structure alternations and argument linking rules. Yukatek Maya has a typologically rare split-intransitive pattern of argument marking controlled by overt aspect-mood marking. Kramer and Wunderlich (1999) have advanced an analysis according to which the linking of thematic relations to syntactic arguments is governed by lexical aspect as the sole lexical-semantic property linking principles are sensitive to in this language. Critical evidence against this proposal comes from the transitivity alternations of three classes of intransitive verbs: 'degree achievement' verbs, 'non-internally-caused' process verbs, and posture verbs. Transitivity alternations emerge as being governed by the distinction of internally vs. externally-caused events. The Yukatek facts suggest that argument vs. linking operates on a lexical information structure ('event structure') that partially determines (and thus also under specifies) both lexical aspect and participant structure.

Abstract = {The article characterizes the three types of actants: semantic, deep-syntactic, and surface-syntactic. The discussion, which is carried out in the syntactic, framework of the meaning-text approach, is based on 1) the distinction between actants and octant slots, as well as 2) an in-depth lexicographic treatment of lexical units involved. Part 1 of the article deals with semantic actants. The concept of linguistic situation SIT(L), specified by the lexical unit L, and that of obligatory participants of a SIT(L) are introduced. A semantic actant slot is defined by a semantic property (the correspondence to a participant of the SIT(L)) and a lexicosyntactic property dence (expressibility of this slot in the text). Optional semantic slots and phraseologically-bound circumstantials are discussed; five linguistic criteria are introduced for the choice between a treatment of 'suspect' dependents via optional semantic slots or via nonstandard lexical functions (i.e. as phraseologically-bound circumstantials). The article considers obligatory/ optional saturation of semantic actant slots, their blocking, and the diathesis of a lexical unit L -- that is, the correspondence between L's thesis semantic actant slots and deep-syntactic actant slots. Finally, the morphological processes used for increasing/decreasing the number of semantic actant slots of a lexical unit are examined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this chapter on early language development, the authors begin with a review of their 1997 word-learning work, which showed that infants have difficulty using even language-specific phonetic detail to map sound to meaning when they are novice word learners. They then review two contrasting theoretical perspectives that might account for this difficulty--representational discontinuity versus attentional resource limitations--and present a number of studies that attempt to disambiguate these two possible explanations. Once the authors identify the age and conditions under which infants can successfully learn phonetically similar words in their own language, they return to the original question and assess whether infants' learning of phonetically similar words is directed by the language-specific perceptual categories established by the end of the first year of life. The chapter ends by connecting the authors' findings to other research in the field, and by raising a series of questions that still need to be answered in order to fully understand the link between infant speech perception and lexical use.

Abstract = {Deficits in verbal fluency are common in HIV-associated dementia (HAD); however, the cognitive underpinnings of these deficits are not well understood. To elucidate the cognitive mechanisms underlying the diminished verbal fluency output in HAD, we examined several qualitative aspects of letter fluency in 21 individuals with HAD, 51 nondemented persons with HIV infection (HIV+), and 30 healthy controls (HC) who were comparable for age, education, sex, ethnicity, and estimated premorbid verbal intelligence. The verbal fluency protocols were scored to obtain the total number of correct words, average phonemic cluster size, total number of switches between phonemic clusters, and the proportion of error responses (i.e., intrusions, perseverations, and variants). Consistent with prior research, HAD participants produced significantly fewer total correct words relative to the HC and nondemented HIV+ groups. The HAD group also demonstrated fewer switches and a higher proportion of response errors (especially intrusion errors), but no differences were observed in average cluster size. Findings are interpreted as reflecting a disruption of rule-guided lexical-semantic search strategies in HAD rather than depleted lexical-semantic memory stores.

Abstract = {45 French words were selected: 15 of them were known by the participants who were also aware of their meaning (KM-W), 15 were known although their meaning was unknown (UM-W), and 15 were unknown (U-W). Although linguistic and experiential frequencies were equivalent for the KM and UM words, familiarity ratings indicated that the former were more familiar. This suggests that usual word familiarity involves two components: familiarity with the word form, and familiarity with the meaning. Pseudowords were constructed from the original words: the familiarity ratings also indicated that KM-Pwords were more familiar than UM-Pwords. These pseudowords were used in a lexical decision task which also made use of normal words. No responses were longer for KM-Pwords than UM-Pwords. This finding supports the assumption that two components are involved in the familiarity of normal words and that this fact should be taken into consideration in any experiment involving lexical decision.

Abstract = {Four experiments are reported to study lexical access in picture naming. Interference was found when semantically related word primes were presented, but no effect was obtained using picture primes (Experiment 1). In Experiments 2a, 2b and 3, we introduced a new technique: Double-priming. The technique requires naming a picture target after presentation of two stimuli: a preprime stimulus and a picture prime. The results showed that the presentation of a semantically related preprime word slowed picture naming (Experiments 2a and 3). The interference was not due to the single effect of the preprime nor to the prime's lexical processing since related primes by themselves (Experiment 1), and primes preceded by unrelated word preprimes (Experiment 2b and 3) did not produce the effect. This pattern of results suggests that lexical access in picture naming involves two types of processes. The first is excitatory and semantic in nature; the second involves competitive lexical selection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The neural basis underlying implicit semantic priming was investigated using event-related fMRI. Prime-target pairs were presented auditorily for lexical decision (LD) on the target stimulus, which was either semantically related or unrelated to the prime, or was a nonword. A tone task was also administered as a control. Behaviorally, all participants demonstrated semantic priming in the LD task. fMRI results showed that for all three conditions of the LD task, activation was seen in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and the inferior parietal lobe, with greater activation in the unrelated and nonword conditions than in the related condition. Direct comparisons of the related and unrelated conditions revealed foci in the left STG, left precentral gyrus, left and right MTGs, and right caudate, exhibiting significantly lower activation levels in the related condition. The reduced activity in the temporal lobe suggests that the perception of the prime word activates a lexicalsemantic network that shares common elements with the target word, and, thus, the target can be recognized with enhanced neural efficiency. The frontal lobe reductions most likely reflect the increased efficiency in monitoring the activation of lexical representations in the...

Abstract = {This study investigates three factors that have been argued to define 'canonical form' in sentence comprehension: Syntactic structure, semantic role, and frequency of usage. We first examine the claim that sentences containing unaccusative verbs present difficulties analogous to those of passive sentences. Using a plausibility judgment task, we show that a mixed group of aphasics performed significantly better on unaccusatives than on passives. We then turn to the observation that passives are generally harder than actives for aphasics. We show that this effect is modulated by lexical bias, i.e., the likelihood that a verb appears in a given syntactic structure: Passives of passive-bias verbs were significantly easier than passives of active-bias verbs. More generally, sentences whose structure matches the lexical bias of the main verb are significantly easier than sentences in which structure and lexical bias do not match. These findings suggest that 'canonical form' reflects frequency and lexical biases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Six-month-old English-learning infants have been shown to prefer English lexical over English grammatical words. The preference is striking because there are few grammatical words in total number but each occurs far more frequently in input speech than any individual lexical word. This could be because lexical words are universally more salient and interesting acoustic and phonological forms than are grammatical words. Alternatively, familiarity may play a role since infants may know some specific lexical words. Here we explore the first possibility by testing Chinese-learning infants' response to English lexical and grammatical words. These infants, who had virtually no prior exposure to English and thus were unfamiliar with any English words, nevertheless preferred to listen to English lexical words, as in the case of English-learning infants. This finding increases the plausibility that it is the acoustic and phonological salience of lexical words that determines the preference for lexical words in infants.

Abstract = {The four experiments reported in this paper were designed to determine to what extent words are lexically represented in terms of their morphological structure. The experiments are carried out in Spanish, a language with rich morphological resources, using a priming paradigm and a lexical decision task. In particular, they examined the pattern of priming effects in regular inflected words with gender and in derived words, in comparison to those produced by orthographically and semantically related words, by manipulating form similarity and semantic transparency. The results showed, on the one hand, that regular inflected words produced reliable facilitatory effects which are not driven just by form relatedness (Experiments 1 and 2). On the other hand, they showed that both transparent and nontransparent derived forms produced facilitatory effects distinct from purely orthographic and semantic effects (Experiments 3 and 4.). In general, these findings suggest that morphological information is represented in the mental lexicon and may play a central role in the individuation and retrieval of lexical entries.

In Swedish, indefinite articles are prosodically comparable to articles in other languages, but definiteness is usually expressed through a suffix. We examined the use of articles in Swedish-speaking children with SLI in spontaneous data and a probe task. Children with SLI produced definite suffixes as accurately as control children. Indefinite articles were more problematic. In constructions in which an article must be supplied, the children with SLI omitted articles more frequently than the controls. We conclude that prosody contributes to the difficulty with articles. However, several details in the data indicated the added influence of lexical and/or grammatical factors.

Abstract = {Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) PET scans were used to study the physiological bases of lipreading, a natural skill of extracting language from mouth movements, which contributes to speech perception in everyday life. Viewing connected mouth movements that could not be lexically identified and that evoke perception of isolated speech sounds (nonlexical lipreading) was associated with bilateral activation of the auditory association cortex around Wernicke's area, of left dorsal premotor cortex, and left opercular-premotor division of the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). The supplementary motor area was active as well. These areas have all been implicated in phonological processing, speech and mouth motor planning, and execution. In addition, nonlexical lipreading also differentially activated visual motion areas. Lexical access through lipreading was associated with a similar pattern of activation and with additional foci in ventral- and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally and in left inferior parietal cortex. The results suggest cortical activation circuits for lipreading from action representations that may differentiate lexical access from nonlexical processes.

Abstract = {It is commonly assumed across the language sciences that some semantic participant information is lexically encoded in the representation of verbs and some is not. In this paper, we propose that semantic obligatoriness and verb class specificity are criteria which influence whether semantic information is lexically encoded. We present a comprehensive survey of the English verbal lexicon, a sentence continuation study, and an on-line sentence processing study which confirm that both factors play a role in the lexical encoding of participant information.

Abstract = {While the role of the frontal lobes in explicit retrieval tasks is well supported, the findings for implicit tasks are less conclusive. We investigated the role of the frontal lobes in perceptual and conceptual implicit priming. Three memory paradigms were given under both implicit and explicit retrieval instructions, using word fragment completion, picture fragment completion and category exemplar generation. Three groups of individuals with frontal lesions were compared to normal controls: Left dorsolateral lesions (n=5), right dorsolateral lesions (n=4), and medial lesions (n=9). Word fragment completion priming was impaired by left dorsolateral lesions, with other priming tests unaffected by any lesion. Explicit performance showed a different pattern, with category exemplar cued recall impaired by left dorsolateral and medial lesions. These findings support the role of the frontal lobes in both implicit and explicit retrieval mechanisms under certain conditions requiring strategy application or lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {The neurological and cognitive aspects of bilingual language processing were examined in late Russian-English bilinguals using headband-mounted eyetracking and functional neuroimaging. A series of three eyetracking studies suggested that, at early stages of word recognition, bilinguals can activate both languages in parallel, even when direct linguistic input is in one language only. A functional neuroimaging study suggested that, although the same general structures are active for both languages, differences within these general structures are present across languages and across levels of processing. For example, different centers of activation were associated with first versus second language processing within the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus, but not within the Superior Temporal Gyrus. We suggest that parallel activation (as found with eyetracking) and shared cortical structures (as found with fMRI) may be characteristic of early stages of language processing (such as phonetic processing), but the two languages may be using separate structures at later stages of processing (such as lexical processing).

Abstract = {Models of lexical ambiguity resolution posit a role for context, but this construct has remained relatively undefined in the literature. The present study isolated two different forms of contextual constraint and examined how these sources of information might differentiate between a selective access and a reordered access model of ambiguity processing. Eye movements were monitored as participants read passages that contained either a balanced or a biased ambiguous word. The sentence containing the ambiguous word was held constant and instantiated either the subordinate meaning (Experiment 1) or the dominant meaning (Experiment 2) through the use of local context. These sentences were embedded in passages in which the topic was consistent, inconsistent, or neutral with respect to the meaning biased by the critical sentence. Experiment 1 provided evidence suggesting that the subordinate meaning of an ambiguous word was not selectively accessed even when sentence and discourse topic information biased that meaning. The data from Experiment 2 provided evidence that even the dominant meaning was not selectively accessed. These contextual sources of information were evaluated in terms of the roles they play in models of lexical ambiguity resolution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined sentence context and grammatical gender on lexical access using a timed word-naming paradigm. Ss were 25 male and female native Italian speakers (aged 19-27 yrs). A total of 550 two-sentence contexts were prepared (440 for use within the factorial gender-by-semantics design; 110 neutral controls containing no semantic or gender constraints). 110 masculine/feminine word targets were used. Large main effects of both sentence context and the gender of the article were observed; the interaction between gender and semantics was significant over Ss. Strong facilitation by both gender and semantics was observed, relative to a neutral-control baseline condition. Results are compared with a prior study with the same design, using a picture-naming paradigm; a separate norming study of timed word reading in a list format, using the same stimuli; and a prior study of German comparing word and picture naming in short, semantically neutral phrases. Differences in methodology and in findings between the Italian word naming and the German word naming are compared and discussed. Findings of the present study are interpreted in support of interactive-activation models in which different sources of information are combined on-line to predict, anticipate, or preactivate lexical targets.

Abstract = {Previous studies have failed to find evidence for long-term cross-language repetition priming (e.g., presentation of the English word 'frog' does not facilitate responding to its Dutch translation equivalent 'kikker' on a later presentation). The present study tested the hypothesis that failure to find cross-language repetition priming in previous studies was due to the use of tasks that rely primarily on lexical or orthographic processing of the stimuli instead of conceptual processing. Consistent with this hypothesis we obtained reliable cross-language repetition priming when conceptual implicit memory tasks were used. The present results support theories of bilingual memory that assume shared conceptual representations for translation equivalents. In particular, our results support the concept mediation model as they indicate that bilinguals access the conceptional representation directly from the L2 lexical representation (i.e., without first accessing the L1 lexical representation).

Abstract = {We exploited the properties of verb phrase (VP) ellipsis constructions containing inherently reflexive and inalienable possession verbs that severely constrained final interpretation (e.g., 'The policeman perjured himself, and the fireman did too...'). Using the cross-modal lexical priming task, we found that listeners reactivated the subject NP from the first clause at the elided position in the second clause (i.e., the 'strict' reading), even though verb properties disallowed such an interpretation. We also found that listeners reactivated the subject NP from the second clause, demonstrating the 'sloppy' interpretation. In a final experiment, we examined VP-ellipsis constructions that did not contain anaphors (e.g., 'The mailman bought a tie for Easter, and his brother did too.. .'). We found that only the object NP of the first clause was reconstructed in the second clause. We interpret these findings as support for a parser that computes multiple interpretations on-line, yet is initially insensitive to lexical and probabilistic information.

Abstract = {Semantic errors are a common type of slip of the tongue for normal speakers; they are also considered to be the hallmark of progressive diseases that affect semantic memory such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and semantic dementia. In unimpaired speakers, semantic errors have been shown to be affected by syntactic variables. Here, we assess whether such an effect of syntactic variables (gender) also holds in experimental tasks designed to induce errors in unimpaired speakers of Italian (another gendered language) and whether this effect can also be observed in the semantic errors produced in the same task by AD patients. We found that for the unimpaired speakers, the gender of the target word constrained the error committed, while this was not the case for the AD patients. We take this finding to suggest a different locus for the errors in the two populations: while the semantic errors by the unimpaired speakers occur because of mis-selection of a lexical entry due to lexical competition among semantically similar words, the errors by the AD patients occur because of insufficient activation of lexical representations.

Abstract = {Verbal fluency declines are commonly reported after pallidotomy in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, it is not clear whether there is an interaction between side of surgery and task format (lexical vs. semantic) or whether error rates (perseverations, intrusions, rule violations) increase after surgery. This study examined verbal fluency before and approximately 4 months after unilateral pallidotomy. The left and right pallidotomy groups (n=16 and n=11 respectively) were matched on key demographic, cognitive, and disease variables. Pallidotomy resulted in a decline in lexical but not semantic verbal fluency, and this decline was most evident in the left-sided surgery group. Error rates (perseverations, intrusions, and rule violations) were not affected by pallidotomy. Findings support the role of left frontal-basal ganglionic circuits in word retrieval processes and/or lexical search and access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The time course of spoken word recognition depends largely on the frequencies of a word and its competitors, or neighbors (similar-sounding words). However, variability in natural lexicons makes systematic analysis of frequency and neighbor similarity difficult. Artificial lexicons were used to achieve precise control over word frequency and phonological similarity. Eye tracking provided time course measures of lexical activation and competition (during spoken instructions to perform visually guided tasks) both during and after word learning, as a function of word frequency, neighbor type, and neighbor frequency. Apparent shifts from holistic to incremental competitor effects were observed in adults and neural network simulations, suggesting such shifts reflect general properties of learning rather than changes in the nature of lexical representations.

Abstract = {Languages vary idiosyncratically in the sets of referents to which common nouns are applied. To use nouns as a native speaker would, second language learners must acquire language-specific naming patterns, not merely a language-to-language correspondence. We asked 68 adult second language learners to name household objects in English and in their native language, to judge the objects' typicality with respect to English names, and to provide naming strategy reports. The least experienced learners' naming and typicality judgments diverged substantially from native responses. More experienced learners improved, but even those with the most extensive experience retained some discrepancies from native patterns. Time spent immersed in an English-speaking environment was a better predictor of performance than years of formal instruction. Discrepancies do not appear to be due to direct mapping from the learner's own language. We discuss how incomplete lexical knowledge may affect second language performance and the implications for models of second language lexical development.

Abstract = {Inter- and intratalker variation in the production of lexical tones may contribute to acoustic overlap among tone categories. The present study investigated whether such category overlap gives rise to perceptual ambiguity and, if so, whether listeners are able to reduce this ambiguity using contextual information. In the first experiment, 16 native Cantonese-speaking listeners were asked to identify isolated Cantonese level tones produced by 7 talkers. Identification accuracy was significantly higher when the presentation of items was blocked by talker rather mixed across talkers. In the second experiment, 16 listeners identified the final (target) tone of 6-syllable semantically neutral sentences with f₀ patterns of the context (i.e., the first 5 syllables) altered. The same target tone was identified differently depending on the context. In the third experiment (n=8), the context portions of stimulus sentences from the second experiment were divided into 2 halves, and their f₀ patterns were altered independently. In identifying the target tone, listeners relied more heavily on the f₀ pattern of the second (last) half of the context. These results are discussed in relation to characteristic inter- and intratalker variations of lexical tones. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Accuracy of report of words in a rapidly presented sequence is reduced if 1 word is a repetition of a previous word. This is repetition blindness. If, however, the items are pronounceable nonwords, or pseudohomophones, repetition improves recall. A repetition advantage for nonwords also occurs when subjects merely count the items or when the item between the critical nonwords is a familiar word. Familiarizing subjects with the nonwords improved the level of recall but did not affect the repetition advantage. These results are considered in relation to token individuation and other accounts of repetition blindness. The findings suggest that for identical linguistic stimuli the types bound to episodic memory tokens that are vulnerable to repetition blindness are lexical units.

Abstract = {Picture-word interference studies typically show that semantically related distractor words embedded within a picture slow picture-naming responses, relative to unrelated ones. This semantic interference effect is commonly interpreted as arising from the competition of lexical-semantic (e.g., Schriefers, Meyer, & Levelt, 1990) or lexical-phonological (e.g., Starreveld & La Heij, 1996) codes. The experiment reported here tests a crucial assumption shared by these accounts--namely, that the effect reflects a lexical, rather than a nonverbal, conceptual conflict. Pictures were named while participants (n=28) attempted to ignore embedded distractors that were in either verbal or pictorial format. The presence of both words and pictures substantially interfered with naming responses, but only words, not pictures, were found to induce semantic interference. These findings support the claim that for semantic interference to arise, both target picture and distractor have to be lexicalized. Consequently, a general conceptual locus of the effect can be excluded, and the claim that semantic interference is based on a lexical conflict is confirmed.

Abstract = {The question of when and how bottom-up input is integrated with top-down knowledge has been debated extensively within cognition and perception, and particularly within language processing. A long running debate about the architecture of the spoken-word recognition system has centered on the locus of lexical effects on phonemic processing: does lexical knowledge influence phoneme perception through feedback, or post-perceptually in a purely feedforward system? J. L. Elman and J. L. McClelland (1988) reported that lexically restored ambiguous phonemes influenced the perception of the following phoneme, supporting models with feedback from lexical to phonemic representations. Subsequently, several authors have argued that these results can be fully accounted for by diphone transitional probabilities in a feedforward system (P. Cairns et al., 1995; M. A. Pitt & J. M. McQueen, 1998). We report results strongly favoring the original lexical feedback explanation: lexical effects were present even when transitional probability biases were opposite to those of lexical biases.

Abstract = {In principle, a specific deficit in processing verbs relative to nouns might arise as a result of damage to any of several mechanisms involved in speech planning and lexical production. Here we describe a fluent aphasic patient HG (aged 79 yrs) who is much worse at retrieving verbs relative to nouns in picture naming and sentence generation, but who retains the ability to produce verbal morphology and even to generate novel verbs productively from nominal roots when she is unable to retrieve appropriate action words (e.g. 'looming' for weaving). Moreover, the results of single word and sentence comprehension tasks suggest that her ability to access lexical forms of verbs is sensitive to their thematic properties. When contrasted with patients who have specific deficits in processing morphosyntactic properties of verbs [J. Neurolinguist. 15 (2002) 265], HG's pattern of performance can be seen as evidence that grammatical properties are functionally distinct from other aspects of lexical representation. We discuss the implications of this dissociation, and of HG's performance specifically, in light of various models of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A key dispute in theories of spoken word recognition is whether activation of a lexical representation can affect the perception of sublexical components, such as phonemes. J. L. Elman and J. L. McClelland (1988) provided evidence for such top-down processing by showing that a prelexical process (compensation for coarticulation) could be affected by lexical activation. However, M. A. Pitt and J. M. McQueen (1998) reported that the observed compensation effects were in fact due to the transitional probability of certain phonemic sequences, rather than lexical activation. Part I of the current study shows that perceptual grouping must be considered in assessing compensation effects, reopening the question of whether lexical activation can drive compensation. Part II shows that when perceptual grouping is taken into account, lexically mediated compensation can indeed be observed, confirming the interactive nature of speech processing. Collectively, the results make it clear that compensation for coarticulation is affected by a number of factors, making it difficult to isolate lexical influences on the phenomenon.

Abstract = {Use of word length for word identification was examined in 3 naming experiments and 1 sentence reading experiment in which a foveally presented cue either matched or mismatched the length of a subsequently presented target word. Properties of the target were also manipulated so that it was either a high- or low-frequency word or so that its exterior letters were either consistent with a large or small pool of candidate words. A total of 114 subjects (Ss) participated across all 4 experiments. The experiments converged in showing that effects of prior word length cuing were either negligible or absent. The word frequency of the target influenced its recognition but not the lexical constraint of its exterior letters. Importantly, effects of target word properties did not interact with effects of prior target length cuing. Together, these results indicate that knowledge of a word's spatial properties does not constrain its lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The aim of the research was to investigate the latent dimensions and lexical nuclei of representations of 'politics', also interpreted in terms of discourse on 'politics'. For this purpose 128 subjects, first year Psychology students, filled in a questionnaire composed of 18 stimulus-words to which they were asked to associate 3 other words. The stimulus-words, selected by Sensales and Rouquette, regarded key concepts in the context of the political sphere: DEMOCRACY, EUROPE, FAMILY, FASCISM, FATHERLAND, FREEDOM, INDIVIDUAL, LEADER, LIBERALISM, ORDER, PARLIAMENT, PEOPLE, POLITICS, POWER, RACE, SOCIALISM, SOCIETY and STATE. The subjects were then asked to complete another questionnaire composed of: a) an Ideological Attitude Scale of 62 items; b) the Italian version of the Need for Cognitive Closure Scale (NCC) as well as c) being asked to state their political orientation and voting behaviour. Results showed semantic representational structure and lexical nuclei articulated in various ways and differentiated according to socio-cognitive construct (NCC), ideological and political orientation and voting behaviour. Results are also discussed in relation to a rhetorical-discursive reconstruction of representational structure and of lexical nuclei. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a series of production and grammaticality judgment experiments, I investigated the status of children's non-adult questions with 2 auxiliary verbs, such as What did the smurf didn't buy. Previous studies showed that these questions were produced primarily in negative contexts. In the first part of the study, I tested whether children produce them in positive contexts with contrastive stress. The results confirm that these questions are limited to negative contexts. In the second part, I tested how children judge these questions. If children produce these questions because they have a non-adult grammar, then they should accept these questions. However, the results from 15 children (age 3;11-4;11) show that they produced these questions but judged them unacceptable. I argue that the production of these questions is not the result of a non-adult grammar but rather the result of a performance phenomenon based on incorrect lexical information regarding constituent negation.

Abstract = {This paper deals with two Spanish prefixation processes, namely auto- and co- prefixation, which affect the participants in the event expressed by the verbal bases to which they apply. From our point of view, these two prefixation processes provide new evidence for the claim that it is necessary to distinguish two levels of lexical representation in the study of the relation between lexical semantics, morphology, and syntax, in the line of Booij (1992), Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1995, 1998), and Sadler and Spencer (1998). We will show that only verbs belonging to a specific lexical class can undergo co- prefixation. Therefore, it seems that this process has to be accounted for at the level of lexical semantic structure. As for auto- prefixation, it will be shown that this morphological process can apply to verbs belonging to very different lexical classes. This seems to indicate that auto- prefixation has to be accounted for at the level of argument structure. However, we will show that the existence of an additional semantic restriction governing auto- prefixation makes it necessary to have reference both to a lexical syntactic level of representation like argument structure and to a semantic level of representation like lexical semantic structure.

Abstract = {In event-related potential (ERP) studies of cognitive processes, the electrophysiological responses are typically contrasted between experimental conditions that are taken to represent discrete categories (e.g. attended vs. unattended stimuli, or real vs. nonsense words). Because categorical variation is less powerful than continuous or parametric variation, a more effective method may be to relate continuous variation in the cognitive process with matching variation in the electrophysiological responses. We assessed continuous variation in the expectancy and meaningfulness of words in different sentence contexts by having subjects rate the words along these two dimensions. ERP averages were then created for each word by averaging the ERP across all subjects' responses to that word. A parametric principal components analysis (PCA) was then conducted by multiplying the factor topographies from the temporal PCA by the parameter correlation maps for each rating parameter. Analysis showed that both expectancy and meaningfulness begin to influence lexical processing around 200 ms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {When we read a text, typical sequences of fixations of words form a rather complicated trajectory-almost like a random walk. This complex behavior is the result of the interplay between lexical processing and programming of saccadic eye movements, the two processes that drive eye movements during reading. Stochastic fluctuations are present in both subsystems. We use a minimal three-state model with residence time-dependent transition probabilities to study the role of stochasticity. In particular, we investigate the influence of noise on reading time by numerical simulations. Our model suggests that performance in reading is enhanced by an intermediate level of noise in lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The 1st analysis, thematic coherence, is a macrostructural analysis, whereas the other 2 analyses, cohesion and lexical errors, are microstructural analyses. Two topics, family description and work experience, were used to elicit discourse; performance was compared between the language samples. Each participant's performance was reviewed individually and findings were compared to the mean performance of a group of 15 normal functioning young adults. Results revealed that mean coherence ratings for each TBI participant were consistently lower than those observed for the control group, regardless of coherence type (local, global) or discourse topic (family, work). Furthermore, the TBI participants demonstrated greater difficulty with global than local coherence and showed more performance variability among participants in global as compared to local coherence. However, all 5 TBI adults displayed minimal deficits in lexical production and cohesion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Results show that performance was better for objects that were positioned spatially so that they could be used together, relative to objects that were positioned inappropriately for their combined use. The action relation was critical, as performance for pictures did not improve if the items were only verbally associated. The opposite result was observed with words. Effects of action relations emerged even on trials where only a single object could be reported, showing implicit coding of action units for selection. The effects of verbal associations may instead reflect priming between lexical entries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

This study examines the proposition that L2 lexical forms are often mapped to the existing semantic content of their first language (L1) translations rather than to new semantic specifications of their own. Native and nonnative English speakers were asked to perform two semantic judgment tasks in which they had to determine the degree of semantic relatedness of English word pairs (experiment 1) or to decide whether two English words were related in meaning (experiment 2). The nonnative speakers, but not the native speakers, were found to provide higher rating scores on or responded faster to L2 word pairs sharing the same Ll translations than to L2 word pairs that do not. The finding is interpreted as strong evidence in support of the presence of Ll semantic content in L2 lexical entries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reports the case of DW, a 77-yr-old aphasic woman who makes a high proportion of formal lexical errors. A few other cases have previously been reported, but DW shows a number of distinguishing characteristics. First, formal lexical errors are made in spelling and not in spoken speech. Second, they are associated with morphological errors and not with semantic errors. Third, they often combine lexical units in ways which are semantically and morphologically illegal. Finally, the majority of morphological errors involve the insertion, rather than the deletion, of suffixes. This pattern can be explained by hypothesizing that DW's errors arise because of confusions among a cohort of lexical neighbors activated top-down from a phonological input and bottom-up from shared letters. One possible cause of the confusions is lack of proper inhibition among lexical competitors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Notes that polysemous words have different but related meanings (senses), such as paper meaning a newspaper or writing material. Six experiments examined the similarity of word senses using categorization and inference tasks. The experiments found that subjects did not categorize together phrases that used a polysemous word in different senses, though they did when the word was used in the same sense. Different senses of a word were categorized together no more than 20% of the time, only slightly more often than different meanings of homonyms. Pre-exposing subjects to a polysemous relation did not increase categorization of word senses that had that relation. Finally, induction from one sense of a word to a different sense was also weak. The results are consistent with the view that polysemous senses are represented separately, often with little semantic overlap, helping to explain previous results that using a word in one sense interferes with using it in another sense, even if the senses are related. Implications for lexical representations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder associated with learning disabilities. This study reports performance on a range of lexical skills in 4 Ss (aged 11.2-15.4 yrs) with WS. Ss with WS had elevated levels of receptive vocabulary, in relation to mental age, on the British Picture Vocabulary scale in which a spoken word has to be matched to a picture from an array with three distracters. However, impairments in receptive vocabulary became apparent when required to select from multiple, semantically-related distracters, so that more detailed semantic specification of the word was required. Oral fluency performance was also characterised by elevated performance levels, yet there were atypical selections with significantly increased proportions of items of low frequency. There were naming difficulties, particularly for the older children and for all the Ss with WS, naming errors were atypical. Yet, when naming was accurate it was faster than that of mental age controls. It is proposed that the parameters governing lexical access in WS have a looser criterion for target identification but more rapid arrival at selected targets. The results are discussed in relation to other contemporary studies of WS and a model of lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two experiments investigated the influence of automatic and strategic processes on associative priming effects in a perceptual identification task in which prime-target pairs are briefly presented and masked. In this paradigm, priming is defined as a higher percentage of correctly identified targets for related pairs than for unrelated pairs. In Exp 1, priming was obtained for mediated word pairs. 26 students participated in Exp 1A and 1B, with 32 in 1C. This mediated priming effect was affected neither by the presence of direct associations nor by the presentation time of the primes, indicating that automatic priming effects play a role in perceptual identification. In Exp 2, 104 students (2A) and 60 students (2B) participated. Exp 2 showed that the priming effect was not affected by the proportion (.90 vs. .10) of related pairs if primes were presented briefly to prevent their identification. However, a large proportion effect was found when primes were presented for 1000 ms so that they were clearly visible. These results indicate that priming in a masked perceptual identification task is the result of automatic processes and is not affected by strategies. The present paradigm provides a valuable alternative to more commonly used tasks such as lexical decision. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study (n = 123 undergraduate students) explores the sensitivity of a new paradigm-- pause detection-- to lexical activity during spoken word processing. Short pauses inserted in five-syllable-long spoken sequences were detected more slowly after words than after spliced nonwords. This effect was substantial for one- and two-syllable initial sequences, and gradually decreased with longer stimuli. Lexical inhibition was also found to depend on the uniqueness point of the stimuli: Late-unique stimuli caused pause detection to be delayed. Finally, pauses were detected more slowly after high-activity than low-activity nonwords (based on the size of their initial cohort). It is argued that pause detection latencies can be used as a gauge of lexical activity in speech sequences and, in particular, at word boundaries. The value of the pause detection paradigm is discussed by reference to other paradigms and their ability to tap, on-line, lexical activation and decay.

Abstract = {Notes that an important determinant of picture and word naming speed is the age at which the names were learned (age of acquisition). Two related interpretations of these effects are that they reflect differences between words in their cumulative frequency of use, or that they reflect differences in the amount of time early and late-acquired words have spent in lexical memory. Both theories predict that differences between early and late-acquired words will be less apparent in older than younger adults. Two experiments are reported in which younger and older adults read words varying in age of acquisition or frequency, or named objects varying in age of acquisition. Experiment 1 involved 28 subjects aged 18-25 yrs and 32 subjects aged 63-86 yrs. Experiment 2 involved 35 subjects aged 18-32 yrs, 32 subjects aged 60-69 yrs, and 32 subjects aged 80-93 yrs. There was an observed effect of word frequency only for young adults' word naming. In contrast, strong age of acquisition effects were found for both the young and the old participants. The implications of these results for theories of how age of acquisition might affect lexical processing are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The effect of morphological complexity on word identification was studied in 3 experiments conducted in Finnish, employing the same set of target nouns. In Experiment 1 (n=18), the target nouns were presented in isolation, and lexical decision times were employed as lexical access measures. In Experiments 2 and 3, the same words were embedded in sentence contexts, where both the inflected and non-inflected forms were equally plausible, and eye fixation patterns (Experiment 2; n=24) and lexical decision latencies (Experiment 3; n=21) were recorded. The experiment with isolated words replicated previous lexical decision studies by showing more effortful processing for inflected than monomorphemic nouns. However, this morphological complexity effect did not generalise to the context experiments; fixation durations and response latencies were highly similar for inflected and monomorphemic words. It is suggested that, at least for the type of inflected nouns studied, the morphological effect observed for isolated words may derive from the syntactic and/or semantic level and not necessarily from the lexical level, as previously assumed.

Both maternal report and observational measures of noun and non-noun lexicons were analyzed. There were marked contrasts in quantity and proportions of nouns between reported and observed lexicons. However, when earlier vocabulary levels were statistically controlled, infants' early replication of novel, but not familiar, words was associated with growth in both reported and observed noun and non-noun vocabularies. Infants' early imitation of novel words predicts, and may facilitate, their later lexical development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The real-time lexical processing of children with specific language impairment (SLI) was examined, and the focus was to determine whether a temporal processing deficit or a general processing capacity deficit disrupts these children's lexical processing. A group of 21 SLI children (mean age 9), a group of 21 age-matched children (CA; mean age 8), and a group of 21 receptive syntax-matched children (RS; mean age 6) completed a sentence processing task in which they monitored sentences for a target word appearing at the beginning, middle, or end of sentences. Sentences systematically varied with respect to containing either a high proportion of stop consonants or a high proportion of nonstop consonants. Children also completed the Identification (ID) Speech Perception Task. On the sentence processing task, SLI children yielded significantly slower word recognition reaction time (RT) overall than both CA and RS controls. Sentence type had no effect on any subject group's RT. On the ID task, SLI children performed significantly worse than CA controls but similarly to RS children. The findings are interpreted to suggest that a general processing capacity limitation was responsible for the poor ID task performance and slower lexical processing of SLI children.

Abstract = {Conducted a study on 10 Williams syndrome (WS) individuals (3 males and 7 females, aged 5 yrs and 6 mo-21 yrs and 4 mo) in which gender agreement and gender assignment were assessed by means of 2 tasks: gender categorization and gender concord. Subjects (Ss) performed gender categorization to real nouns whose gender was regular or exceptional given their ending, and to invented nouns which were composed of nonword or word stems and real word-endings. The same material was used in the gender concord task in which Ss had to match the items with the appropriate form of the article and the adjective carrying gender agreement. In the gender categorization of real words, WS Ss were lower than the 29 controls (aged 4 yrs and 9 mo-6 yrs and 1 mo) but both groups demonstrated sensitivity to gender-ending regularities. The WS Ss produced more ending-consistent responses than the controls. WS relied on the gender clue provided by the ending even when the gender of the word evoked by the stem of the invented word was opposed to that evoked by the ending. In the second task, the WS Ss performed well although lower than the controls. WS Ss were not impaired in gender agreement but experienced difficulties in retrieving lexical instances.

Abstract = {We extend research in articulation latency by examining the prepared production of utterances containing phonological words that are less than a lexical word in length. Dutch compounds (e.g., ooglid 'eyelid') form a single morphosyntactic word and a phonological word, which in turn includes two phonological words. We compare their prepared production latencies to those syntactic phrases consisting of an adjective and a noun (e.g., oud lid 'old member') which comprise two morphosyntactic and two phonological words, and to morphologically simple words (e.g., orgel 'organ') which comprise one morphosyntactic and one phonological word. Our findings demonstrate that the effect is limited to phrasal level phonological words, suggesting that production models need to make a distinction between lexical and phrasal phonology.

A left-temporal focus of activity 150-275 ms after stimulus onset in the gender decision compared to the semantic classification task was discussed as indicating the retrieval of syntactic information, while a more expanded left hemispheric activity in the gender relative to the semantic task 300-625 ms after stimulus onset was discussed as indicating phonological encoding. A predominance of activity in the semantic task was observed over right fronto-central region 150-225 ms after stimulus-onset, suggesting that semantic and syntactic processes are prominent in this stage of lexical selection.

Abstract = {Describes how Turkish and Moroccan adults acquire Dutch possessive clauses in which the verb HAVE expresses the possessive relationship. The acquisition process is explained within the framework of recent generative theory in which HAVE-clauses are assumed to be copular locative constructions. In this theory, predicate inversion of the locative PP and incorporation of the locative PO into a BE-copula are the main characteristics of a possessive HAVE-clause. Assuming that all linguistic knowledge of the L1 is present, L2 learners rely on it from the earliest stages, irrespective of whether this L1 knowledge is parameter-related or not. The results confirm such a 'conservation' viewpoint, which accounts for how the possessive relationship is expressed in the earliest stages and why these learners have their language specific difficulties in discovering the target HAVE-construction. The results corroborate the conservation effect of both parametrized linguistic knowledge, that is, the strong features triggering predicate inversion, and nonparametrized knowledge, that is, knowledge of syntax, morphology and morphological realization rules, and properties of lexical items.

Abstract = {This study presents a new technique for studying the activation of semantic and phonological codes in speech planning using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) that extend a well-established behavioral procedure from speech production research. It combines a delayed picture-naming task with a priming procedure. While participants prepared the production of a depicted object's name, they heard an auditory target word. If the prepared picture name and the target word were semantically or phonologically related the ERP waveform to the target word tended less towards the negative when compared to an unrelated control. These effects were widely distributed. By contrast, if participants performed a nonlinguistic task on the depicted object (natural size judgment), the semantic effect was still obtained while the phonological effect disappeared. This suggests that the former effect indexes semantic activation involved in object processing while the latter effect indexes word-form activation specific to lexical processing. The data are discussed in the context of models of lexical access in speech production. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The current study reports on the performance, 1 year later, of 28 original study participants (mean age 10.2 yrs) on the same experimental task. Results show that overall, from Time 1 to Time 2 testing, gains were greater in English than in Spanish and in the high competition mixed-language processing condition than in the single-language processing condition. These results reinforce previous findings of a shift toward greater strength in language 2 with increasing age (and years of language experience), as well as the primary role of cognitive development in control of the dual-language system. In addition, examination of individual performance revealed a complex non-monotonic pattern of language 1-language 2 change across time within an overall pattern of increasing speed, accuracy, and control of the dual-lexical system.

Abstract = {The difficulty to recall proper nouns is often something elderly people complain about. Thus, we tried to build and standardize a tool that could allow a quantified estimation of the naming and recognition abilities about famous people faces, specifying the part of gender, age and cultural level for each kind of test. The performances of 542 subjects divided in 3 age brackets and 3 academic knowledge levels were analysed. One same person thus photographed 75 characters from different social categories with the same conditions of light, during only one day. The results of the study show that men performed better than women as concerns the naming task, but that there was no difference between genders as concerns the recognition task. Recognition performances are significantly better whatever the age, the gender and the cultural level may be. Generally, performances are all the more better since subjects are younger and have a higher cultural level. Our study then confirms the fact that normal aging goes hand in hand with rising difficulties to name faces. Moreover, results tend to show that recognition of faces remains better preserved and that the greater disability to recall a name is linked to difficulties in lexical accessing.

Abstract = {Lexical stress patterns appear to be important in word recognition processes in normal individuals. The present investigation employed a lexical decision task to assess whether left (LHD) and right hemisphere damaged (RHD) patients (aged 34-87 yrs) are similarly sensitive to stress patterns in lexical access. The results confirmed that individuals without brain damage are influenced by stress patterns, as indicated by increased lexical decision latencies to incorrectly stressed word and nonword stimuli. The data for the LHD patients revealed an effect of stress for real word targets only, whereas the reaction time data for the RHD patients as a group showed no significant influence of stress pattern. However, there was a great deal of individual variability in performance. The latency and error rate findings suggest that LHD patients and non-brain-damaged individuals are both sensitive to lexical stress in word recognition, but the LHD patients are more likely to treat incorrectly stressed items as nonwords. The results are discussed in relation to theories of the hemispheric lateralization of prosodic processing and the role of lexical stress in word recognition.

Abstract = {In a time-accuracy study, encoding for visual search and memory search was compared in a sample of 23 younger (mean age 18.8 yrs) and 26 older (mean age 71.5 yrs) adults. Older adults were found to be slower than younger adults in two respects (viz., processing was delayed, and speed-of-processing was lower). There was no reliable age difference in asymptotic performance when analyzed at the level of proportion correct. Age differences in speed-of-processing were larger in visual search than in memory search. The results run counter capacity- or resource accounts of cognitive aging, but they are in line with the framework that predicts larger age differences in visuo-spatial than lexical tasks.

Abstract = {We investigated the processes of lexical retrieval during the production of adjectival noun phrases (NPs) such as 'the blue kite'. We used various current assumptions about the scope of grammatical and phonological encoding and about the locus of the classic frequency effect to derive predictions about possible frequency effects in the NP naming task. The predictions were tested in two picture-naming experiments where we manipulated orthogonally the frequencies of the adjective and of the noun that composed the NPs. We consistently found frequency effects for both adjectives and nouns. Moreover the effects were additive. We argue that the existence of a frequency effect for the noun during noun phrase production restricts the various combinations of assumptions that speech production models can hold simultaneously. Possible implications of the additivity of the effects for the time course of lexical access are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This paper investigated the acquisition of compound vs phrasal stress (hót dog vs hot dóg) in English. This has previously been shown to be acquired quite late, in contrast to research showing that infants both perceive and prefer rhythmic patterns in their own language. 40 children in 4 groups (mean ages 5.3, 7.1, 9.2 and 11.5 yrs) and 10 adults were shown pairs of pictures representing a compound word and the corresponding phrase. Ss heard a prerecorded tape with the names of the items, and were asked to indicate which one they heard. In addition to 9 real compounds and corresponding phrases, 9 novel compounds were presented (rédcup = invented type of flower vs redcúp). A gradual increase in overall correct scores until age 12 was found along with a significant effect of real vs novel compounds, and an overwhelming tendency for the younger children to prefer compounds regardless of stress. It is concluded that the results are due to the slow development of the ability to use prosodic information to override a strong lexical bias.

Abstract = {Compared the semantic processing abilities of 11 college students (aged 18-21 yrs) with learning disabilities (LD) to those of their peers without learning disabilities (NLD) who were matched for age, gender, and intelligence. Participants were compared on results from the Test of Adolescent Adult Word Finding (TAWF) and from event-related potential (N400) sampling to the processing of semantically incongruous sentences. The LD and NLD groups did not significantly differ in accuracy on the TAWF; however, students with LD demonstrated a significantly greater number of delayed responses. The LD group's N400 responses were significantly delayed at the Pz electrode site. Effect size indicators also reveal somewhat reduced amplitudes at Fz and Cz locations. The significant delays of the students with LD on standardized testing and on N400 suggest an inefficiency in the semantic processing of these individuals, in both automatic and attention-based aspects of lexical access.

Participants completed a 2AFC picture identification task in which they identified 1 of the 6 contrastive Cantonese tones produced on the monosyllabic target word /ji/. Each target stimulus represented a concrete object and was presented within a carrier phrase in sentence-medial position. Group performance was significantly above chance for 3 contrasts. However, the cochlear implant listeners performed much worse than a 6 1/2 yr-old, moderately hearing impaired control listener who was tested on the same task. These findings suggest that this group of cochlear implant users had great difficulty in extracting the pitch information needed to accurately identify Cantonese lexical tones.

The development appears to be typical of a large class of intensifiers, though it is argued that literally itself is only in the early stages of such an evolution. Aspects of this development are observed to run counter to well-known tendencies for meaning change to involve subjectification, and it is suggested that subjectification itself may be a special case of the ways in which originally pragmatic meanings can become conventionalized properties of a form's lexical semantics.

Abstract = {In four experiments with 96 Ss, we examined the facilitation that occurs when spoken-word targets rhyme with preceding spoken primes. In Experiment 1, listeners' lexical decisions were faster to words following rhyming words (e.g., ramp-LAMP) than to words following unrelated primes (e.g., pink--LAMP). No facilitation was observed for nonword targets. Targets that almost rhymed with their primes (foils; e.g., bulk-SULSH) were included in Experiment 2; facilitation for rhyming targets was severely attenuated. Experiments 3 and 4 were single-word shadowing variants of the earlier experiments. There was facilitation for both rhyming words and nonwords; the presence of foils had no significant influence on the priming effect. A major component of the facilitation in lexical decision appears to be strategic: listeners are biased to say 'yes'to targets that rhyme with their primes, unless foils discourage this strategy. The nonstrategic component of phonological facilitation may reflect speech perception processes that operate prior to lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Moreover, they were sensitive to constituent order (noun-adjective vs adjective-noun) within noun phrases, but less so within compounds. These results suggest differential processing for compounds as compared to noun phrases: while the latter require standard morphosyntactic operations that are often impaired in aphasic patients, the former can be accessed as whole words at the lexical level.

The lexical decision experiment (conducted with 12 male and 15 female Ss, mean age 25 yrs) compared -n plurals and irregular -er plurals to plurals with the default affix -s. Whereas the -s plurals yielded no wordform frequency effects, such effects could be observed for all other plural forms, including all subclasses of -n plurals. The priming experiment (conducted with 29 male and 34 female Ss, mean age 26 yrs) produced a different pattern. The authors found that the prior presentations of fully predictable -n plurals prime the stems as effectively as the stem itself, whereas -n plurals with limited predictability yielded only reduced priming effects toward their stems.

This article reports evidence from 3 stem-homograph priming studies (n = 87 undergraduates) that implicate both morphological parsing and lexical selection processes at the lemma level. The authors argue that stem-homograph inhibition is the product of lexical selection mechanisms that are engaged just when a fully ambiguous stimulus (here, an inflectional stem) must be assigned one of its viable interpretations in order to afford conscious perception of lexical identity.

Abstract = {Evaluated the effect of semantic priming with a lexical decision task in 22 depressed patients and 30 control Ss who were evaluated twice: 1st when they arrived at the hospital, and then again after clinical improvement. Clinical improvement was evaluated using standard depression rating scales. A lexical decision task involving semantic relations (related vs unrelated, e.g., apple-pear) was used to evaluate the processing of semantic information. The results show that, for the 1st evaluation, the depressive Ss presented similar semantic priming to controls. A comparison of semantic priming in the 1st and the 2nd passes showed an identical amplitude. The sole difference between the 2 passes concerns the global reaction time in the depressive group. This last result suggests that, with clinical improvement, the characteristic psychomotor retardation declines. These results indicate, in this clinical population, the preservation of controlled processes implicated in this lexical decision task. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

A female (aged 23 yrs) exhibiting severely impaired reading of single words underwent therapy using the Wilson Reading System, a program using grapheme-phoneme correspondences, blending, and phonological awareness. The S underwent input, output, oral production, lexical, parsing, and phonological awareness testing prior to, during, immediately following the therapy, and at 1-mo follow-up. Results show that the S significantly improved in single word oral reading for the targeted syllabic structure and in nonword reading. There was also a significant reduction in semantic errors in oral reading. At 1-mo follow-up, the S maintained treatment gains. It is concluded that the partial use of phonological information, combined with semantic information, results in improved accuracy of oral reading; Ss with deep dyslexia may benefit from attention to the phonological component of reading in addition to the lexical-semantic component.

Abstract = {Examined the effects of priming on perception of word meaning by individuals with aphasia. Seven English-speaking individuals (mean age 55.6 yrs) with aphasia completed cross-modal lexical decision tasks, in which lexically ambiguous words were auditorily presented in sentences following visual presentation of synonymous probe words. Results show no priming effects for the control group, thereby rendering results uninterpretable for aphasia Ss.

Abstract = {Compared the oral narrative skills of 31 school-aged children diagnosed at 24 to 31 months with expressive language delay (late talkers) with those of 23 typically developing peers. Based upon an extensively studied picture-book task, narratives were elicited from all participants at ages 8 and 9 yrs. At age 9 yrs, children were asked to tell the story again and to increase their references to evaluative information (characters' emotions, character speech, and causal explanations of events; 'supported' telling condition). Children with histories of early language delay obtained lower syntax, story grammar, and evaluative information factor scores. Late talkers scored in the average range at age 8 yrs on the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Revised (CELF-R), but their scores were significantly lower than those of the comparison peers. When the group differences on the story grammar factor were reanalyzed with the CELF-R score, the late talkers demonstrated weaknesses in story grammar skills independent of the variance accounted for by their weaker general language skills. This suggests that the use of narrative structure may be a specific area of underachievement for late talkers, in addition to their continuing weakness in syntactic and lexical abilities.

Abstract = {Investigated the effect of noise masking on on-line (OL) syntactic processing. 90 18-26 yr olds were tested on measures of working memory and OL sentence comprehension and were were divided into 3 listening conditions: no noise masking, and -3 dB or -4.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio. In the auditory moving windows paradigm used to measure OL sentence processing, Ss pressed a button for the successive presentation of each phrase in 2 types of sentences (syntactically simple and complex), and listening times were recorded for each phrase. Results show that listening times were longer overall with increased noise masking, and listening times were longer overall at the verb of the harder sentence type. However, the increase at the verb was not larger with increased noise masking. All 3 groups showed similar effects of syntactic structure in the OL data. The OL syntactic effects were not due to problems in word recognition. Correlational analyses did not indicate a relationship between the increase in processing time at the capacity demanding region of the harder sentence types and any of the measures of working memory capacity in any of the 3 listening conditions. Results indicate that OL sentence processing is not affected by noise masking if lexical access remains intact. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated integration of the appropriate meaning of an ambiguous word into context by 10 nonfluent aphasic patients and 18 elderly control Ss. In the semantic priming experiment, ambiguous words (homonyms) were presented in different biasing sentence contexts at both a 0- and 750-msec interstimulus interval (ISI). Results show that at both ISIs, control Ss showed context-selective access, in that only contextually appropriate meanings were activated. In contrast, at the 0-msec ISI, the nonfluent aphasic patients showed activation of both meanings of the ambiguous word regardless of context. Only at the 750-msec ISI did they exhibit context-selective access. These results are consistent with the proposal that left hemisphere damage causing nonfluent aphasia results in an impairment in rapidly integrating lexical-semantic information into context.

Abstract = {Investigated the processing of lexical ambiguity in context in 8 individuals with schizophrenia and a matched control group. Ss made speeded lexical decisions on the 3rd word in auditory word triplets representing concordant (coin-bank-money), discordant (river-bank-money), neutral (day-bank-money), and unrelated (river-day-money) conditions. Results show that when the interstimulus interval between the words was 100 msec, Ss with schizophrenia demonstrated priming consistent with selective, context-based lexical activation. At 1250 msec interstimulus interval, there was a pattern of nonselective meaning facilitation. These results suggest an attentional breakdown in the sustained inhibition of meanings on the basis of lexical context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {We describe a 68-yr-old male patient with nonfluent aphasia who presents with sparse, fragmented spontaneous speech but normal or near-normal performance on standard naming tasks. However, more detailed investigation revealed some unusual features to the S's naming: On a task involving repeated naming of a small set of targets, his performance degenerated when the targets were semantically blocked, particularly at fast rates of presentation. This semantic blocking effect was not observed in an analogous word-picture matching task. Also, it was not present on a task where a set of words had to be named repeatedly in a fixed, predictable sequence. Finally, a 78-yr-old male fluent aphasic patient who presented with a classic 'output' anomia failed to show the semantic blocking and predictability effects. It is suggested that the S suffers from a context-sensitive word retrieval disorder. The disorder is attributed to a difficulty in modulating activation within the lexical network. Implications for nonfluent aphasia, as well as for models of lexical retrieval, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comparison mechanisms have been implicated in the development of abstract, relational thought, including object categorization. D. Gentner and L. L. Namy (1999) found that comparing 2 perceptually similar category members yielded taxonomic categorization, whereas viewing a single member of the target category elicited shallower perceptual responding. The present experiments tested 2 predictions that follow from Gentner and Namy's (1999) model: (a) Comparison facilitates categorization only when the targets to be compared share relational commonalities, and (b) providing common labels for targets invites comparison, whereas providing conflicting labels deters it. Four-yr-olds participated in a forced-choice task. They viewed 2 perceptually similar target objects and were asked to 'find another one.' Results suggest an important role for comparison in lexical and conceptual development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A re-analysis and review of previous research cast doubt on the sufficiency of social approaches to word learning. An empirical investigation of the relation of social-pragmatic and data-providing features of input to the productive vocabulary of sixty-three 2-year-old children revealed benefits of data provided in mother-child conversation, but no effects of social aspects of those conversations. The findings further revealed that the properties of data that benefit lexical development in 2-year-olds are quantity, lexical richness, and syntactic complexity. The nature of the computational mechanisms implied by these findings is discussed. An integrated account of the roles of social and computational processes to lexical development is proposed.

Abstract = {Using a lexical decision task, the authors investigated whether brain asymmetries in the detection of emotionally negative semantic associations arise only at a perceptually discriminative stage at which lexical analysis is accurate or can already be found at crude and incomplete levels of perceptual representation at which word-nonword discrimination is based solely on guessing. Emotionally negative and neutral items were presented near perceptual threshold in the left and right visual hemifields in a sample of healthy Ss (mean age 26.35 yrs old). Word-nonword discrimination performance as well as the bias to classify a stimulus as a 'word' (whether or not it actually is a word) were assessed for a normal, horizontal stimulus presentation format (Exp 1) and for an unusual, vertical presentation format (Exp 2). Results show that while the 2 hemispheres are equally able to detect affective semantic associations at a prelexical processing stage (both experiments), the right hemisphere is superior at a postlexical, perceptually discriminative stage (Exp 2). Moreover, the findings suggest that only an unusual, nonoverlearned stimulus presentation format allows adequate assessment of the right hemisphere's lexical-semantic skills.

Analyses of variance performed on the data indicated that: (a) negotiated interaction had a positive effect on the comprehension of L2 words; (b) only negotiated interaction that incorporated pushed output appeared to have promoted both receptive and productive acquisition of words as well as an increase in productive word retention; and (c) negotiated interaction plus output did not promote receptive acquisition more than negotiation without output, but it was more effective in promoting productive acquisition, The findings of this study provide empirical evidence for the important role of negotiation in facilitating the comprehension and acquisition of L2 vocabulary, which suggests that output plays a key role within the negotiation process for productive lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {What do novice word learners know about the sound of words? Word-learning tasks suggest that young infants (14 mo old) confuse similar sounding words, whereas mispronounciation detections tasks suggest that slightly older infants (18-24 mo old) correctly distinguish similar words. The authors explored whether the difficulty at 14 mo stems from infants' novice status as word learners or whether it is inherent in the task demands of learning new words. Results from 3 experiments support a developmental explanation. In Exp 1, infants of 20 mo learned to pair 2 phonetically similar words to 2 different objects under precisely the same conditions that infants of 14 mo failed in Exp 2. In Exp 3, infants of 17 mo showed intermediate, but still successful, performance in the task. Vocabulary size predicted word learning performance but only in the younger, less experienced word learners. The implications of these results for theories of word learning and lexical representation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The hypothesis that the earliest representations in visual processing of print are activated word-specific units leads to the expectation that homophonic priming (HP) should be greater for word pairs than pseudohomophone pairs. Ten experiments with naming disconfirmed this hypothesis. At interstimulus intervals of 0, 129, 516, and 930 ms, HP for pseudohomophones (e.g., HOEZ-hoze vs. HOGZ-hoze) equaled HP for words (e.g., KNOWS-nose vs. KNEES-nose). The complementary finding of negative HP with pseudohomophones relative to positive HP with words was found in an additional investigation of lexical decision. The results confirm a critical early stage in visual word recognition, in which words are represented in purely phonological form, and implicate equal speeds in dual-route models for nonlexical and lexical processing.

Neighbors of a given katakana word were defined in 2 ways: a kana-level neighbor is a katakana word that can be constructed by changing 1 letter of the target word preserving the other letter positions, and a phoneme-level neighbor is a katakana word that can be created by changing 1 phoneme preserving the other phoneme positions of the target. Ss in Exp 1 were 9 male and 21 female undergraduates and graduates (mean age 20.8 yrs) and in Exp 2 were 11 male and 19 female undergraduates and graduates (mean age 20.5 yrs), with normal vision in Japan. In Exp 1, Ss participated in a lexical decision task and numbers of kana-level neighbor were manipulated. The result showed that the number of kana-level neighbors had an inhibitory effect on the lexical decision of low-familiarity katakana words. In Exp 2, Ss participated in a lexical decision task and numbers of phoneme-level neighbors were manipulated. The result showed that the number of phoneme-level neighbors had no effect on the lexical decision of katakana words. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A number of studies demonstrate the contribution of the right hemisphere (RH) in the processing of language. However, we do have not sufficient records on the perturbations of speech for such type of lesions in different languages. For this reason we studied multiple levels of linguistic and communicative performance in patients speaking Spanish in Rio de la Plata region. In this paper we present the results obtained in lexical processing tasks applied to 14 neurologically evaluated patients: mean age 67.5 years; instruction level, 9 years old, with ischemic lesion in RH. Lexical performance in nomination, recognition and lexical evocation tasks was also evaluated and its results compared with a control group of 20 healthy subjects. The study showed significant differences (< 0.05) concerning lexical semantic and phonologic evocation in 9 patients. We did not found differences in the performance of group of patients in the tasks of naming and recognition when they were compared with the control group. The deficit in patients was correlated with frontal-temporal lesions. The RH role was confirmed in the lexical semantic processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This article starts with a review of the major findings about the representation of written language in bilinguals, both at the level of word forms and at the level of word meanings. Then, the most important model of bilingual word translation is described, followed by some recent findings on number translation that are problematic for the model. Finally, a new masked priming experiment is presented, in which 22 Dutch-French bilinguals had to name Arabic digits, number words of their first language, and number words of their second language both in their first and second language. The targets were preceded by a masked Arabic prime numeral, which had a value ranging from Target minus 3 to Target plus 3. Previous research with monolinguals had shown that the priming effect of Arabic numerals depends on the difference in magnitude between prime and target. This effect was repeated in the present study and extended to the translation conditions. Regression analyses revealed strong priming effects in both forward and backward translation. Based on these findings, it is argued that future models of bilingual memory should see all translation processes as the result of the summed activation from a semantically mediated route and a direct, lexical route.

Abstract = {Discusses psychoanalytic explanations for the prevalent phenomenon of the transition of writers from poetry to prose writing. The characteristics of the 'poetic' (or 'lyric') vs the 'prosaic' mode of writing are described and related to 2 early developmental positions. The 'lyric' position is related to the earlier psychological position, which is characterized by narcissism, the dominance of primary processes, looseness of ego boundaries, a lack of clear differentiation between the self and objects, and a high level of unity between symbol and symbolized. The 'prosaic' position is related to the later developmental position, which entails strengthening of ego functioning, strengthening of secondary processes, the presence of a narrating subject who is more separate and self-conscious and often has a more realistic and integrative regard for himself and for objects around him. In this position, symbolization is more differentiated and there is a syntactical and lexical fullness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In a tone language, pitch variations are used to contrast word meaning. For example, the Cantonese syllable /si/ means 'teacher' when spoken in a high pitch and 'yes' when spoken in a low pitch. How is fundamental frequency (Fo) used to signal lexical tones that occur in songs? In an examination of Cantonese songs, it was found that songwriters abandon the ratio scale of Fo differences that is applied to lexical tones in carefully read speech and instead use an ordinal scale. For example, a high tone that is normally 12% higher than a mid-tone in speech can be realized as any higher Fo (but never a lower Fo) in songs. A perceptual experiment showed that native Cantonese-speaking listeners similarly apply an ordinal Fo scale to arrive at the lexical meaning of the lyric. This ratio-to-ordinal mapping in Cantonese songs ensures the musicality of the melody while preserving adequate identifiability of lexical tones in the lyric.

Abstract = {The effect of a language therapy in a group of 8 anomic mild patients (mean age 67.7 yrs) (the Lexical Therapy group) was assessed by using a 5-mo long Lexical Therapy in comparison with an occupational program used in a matched control group (AD) of 8 Ss (mean age 73.8 yrs). The Lexical Therapy group benefited significantly from a language therapy as shown by the naming improvement postintervention. The improvement reached significance only for items that were included in the language therapy protocol and no significant generalization to untreated items was observed. In mild AD patients with anomia and no severe semantic impairment, a reinforcement of the relationship between the form of the object and the corresponding lexical label in episodic long term memory during language therapy may account for the observed lexical improvement.

Abstract = {Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to investigate lexical decisions to words of high and low frequency of occurrence and to pseudowords. 12 paid volunteers (aged 20-31 yrs) participated in the study. The results obtained strongly support dual-route models of visual word processing. By contrasting words with pseudowords, bilateral occipito-temporal brain areas and posterior left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) were identified as contributing to the successful mapping of orthographic percepts onto visual word form representations. Low-frequency words and pseudowords elicited greater activations than high-frequency words in the superior pars opercularis [Brodmann's area (BA) 44] of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), in the anterior insula, and in the thalamus and caudate nucleus. As processing of hese stimuli during lexical search is known to rely on phonological information, it is concluded that these brain regions are involved in grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Activation in the pars triangularis (BA 45) of the left IFG as observed only for low-frequency words. It is proposed that this region is involved in processes of lexical election.

Biphone frequency was counted as the number of 3 phoneme words in which the phoneme pair occurs. In the first experiment of the current article, the authors made the same manipulation while controlling for the number of lexical neighbors and found no effect of biphone frequency. In the second experiment, the authors manipulated neighborhood size while controlling biphone frequency and found a significant effect of neighborhood size.

Abstract = {The etiology of persistent stuttering is unknown, but stuttering has been attributed to multiple potential factors, including difficulty in processing language-related information, but findings remain inconclusive regarding any  specific linguistic deficit potentially causing stuttering. One particular challenge in drawing conclusions is the highly variable task demands across studies. Different tasks could potentially reflect either different processes, or different levels of demand. This study examined the role of cognitive demand in semantic and phonological processes to evaluate the role of linguistic processing in the etiology of stuttering. The study examined concurrent processing of picture naming and tone-identification in typically fluent young adults, adults who stutter (AWS) and matched adults who do not stutter (NS), with varying temporal overlap between the dual tasks as manipulation of cognitive demand. The study found 1) that in both AWS and NS, semantic and phonological encoding both interacted with non-linguistic processing during concurrent processing, suggesting that both linguistic processes are demanding in cognitive resources, 2) that there was no observable relationship between dual-task interference to word encoding and stuttering, 3) that AWS and NS showed different trends of phonological encoding under high but not low cognitive demand, suggesting a subtle phonological deficit in AWS, and 4) that the phonological encoding effect correlated with stuttering rate, suggesting that phonological deficit could potentially play a role in the etiology or persistence of stuttering. Additional findings include potential differences in semantic encoding between typically fluent young adults and middle-age adults, as well as potential strategic differences in processing semantic information between AWS and NS. Findings were taken to support stuttering theories suggesting specific deficits in phonological encoding and argue against a primary role of semantic encoding deficiency or lexical access deficit in stuttering.

Abstract = {There is much evidence demonstrating that bilinguals activate lexical representations from both of their languages in a non-selective manner even in sentence context. Comparatively less research has examined the extent to which bilingual lexical representations interacts with syntactic processing in sentence context. The purpose of this study is to examine whether bilinguals' cross-language lexical activation could influence their resolution of syntactic ambiguity (e.g. relative clause attachment). Proper attachment of relative clauses (RC) to noun phrases is critical for accurate interpretation of syntactically ambiguous sentences. For instance, the sentence The robber shot the secretary of my husband who goes to work on weekends is syntactically ambiguous, because who could refer either to the first noun (i.e., secretary) or the second noun (i.e., husband ) in the complex noun phrase (NP). Previous monolingual studies have shown that readers' working memory capacity influences their disambiguation process. Since cognates can be easier activated, we hypothesized that when a cognate noun was presented in the complex noun phrase bilinguals would have more mental resources available to disambiguate the attachment ambiguity. Furthermore, previous bilingual studies have shown that monolingual Spanish and English speakers differ in how they prefer to resolve this type of ambiguity. Spanish speakers prefer to resolve the ambiguity by attaching to the first noun and English speakers prefer to attach the second noun. Therefore, in this study we also tested what disambiguation preferences do Spanish-English bilinguals have when they use both languages on a daily bases. This study consisted of two experiments. In each experiment, Spanish-English bilinguals participated in a Sentences Reading Task monitored by an eye-tracker and a reading span task. In experiment 1, I tested whether putting a cognate at the first noun or the second noun position would help bilinguals disambiguate the sentences faster. In experiment 2, I tested the effect of semantic overlap on resolving the syntactic ambiguity of the sentences. More specifically, this experiment included nouns that differ in whether they share all meanings (e.g. piano), only one meaning (e.g. arm) or no meaning (e.g. fin) with Spanish. Using the sentences that are temporally ambiguous (e.g. The security guard shot the daughter of the actor, who just started kindergarten last year ), I have found that bilinguals who attend an English instruction institution show second noun attachment preference even when their self-rating language proficiency is equivalent for both languages. Moreover, the result also showed that irrespective of position of attachment (i.e., first or second noun) in a sentence and as long as the cognate was the correct attached noun, participants significantly spent less time in the region in which attachment is disambiguated (e.g. kindergarten). The results of reading span also showed that as individuals' working memory capacity increased their reading time on disambiguating region decreased. However, words with cross-language properties can alter the correlation between individual working memory capacity and relative clause attachment. Results were discussed in terms of current theories of syntactic parsing and bilingual lexical representation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Compared the performance of Broca's aphasics (aged 51-80 yrs) with that of normal Ss in an auditory semantic priming paradigm. Lexical decision times were measured in response to word targets preceded by an intact semantically related prime word, by a related prime in which one segment was acoustically altered to produce a poorer phonetic exemplar, and by a semantically unrelated prime. The effects of the locus of the acoustic distortion within the prime word (initial or final position) and the presence of potential lexical competitors were examined. In normal Ss, the acoustic manipulations produce a small, short-lived reduction in semantic facilitation irrespective of the position of the distortion in the prime word or the presence of a voiced lexical competitor. Broca's aphasics showed a large and lasting reduction in priming in response to word-initial acoustic distortions, and a weak effect of word-final distortions on priming. In both phonetic positions, the effect of distortion was greater for prime words with a lexical competitor. Findings show that Broca's aphasics have reduced lexical activation levels, which disrupt the bottom-up access of words on the basis of acoustic input as well as increased vulnerability to competition between acoustically similar lexical items.

Abstract = {The competitive nature of the lexical selection process during spoken word production is well established in monolinguals. This paper examined the implication of this process for spoken word production in bilinguals. A cross-language semantic competitor priming effect was demonstrated, which shows that cross-language lexical competition is a feature of the word production system of the unbalanced English-French bilinguals who participated in the experiment. Experimental evidence was also found which suggests that a selected language bias effected through inhibition of the unwanted language plays an important role in resolving the cross-language lexical competition during bilingual word production in a selected language. The data further suggest that the dominance of the unwanted language relative to the selected language determines the presence/absence or 'strength' of inhibition through which the selected language bias is effected. These findings are also interpreted in terms of a recent language-specific lexical selection account of bilingual lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of visual familiarity of words on interhemispheric lexical processing. Words and pseudowords were tachistoscopically presented in a left, a right, or bilateral visual fields. Two types of words, Katakana-familiar-type and Hiragana-familiar-type, were used as the word stimuli. The former refers to the words which are more frequently written with Katakana script, and the latter refers to the words which are written predominantly in Hiragana script. Two conditions for the words were set up in terms of visual familiarity for a word. In visually familiar condition, words were presented in familiar script form and in visually unfamiliar condition, words were presented in less familiar script form. The 32 right-handed Japanese students were asked to make a lexical decision. Results showed that a bilateral gain, which indicated that the performance in the bilateral visual fields was superior to that in the unilateral visual field, was obtained only in the visually familiar condition, not in the visually unfamiliar condition. These results suggested that the visual familiarity for a word had an influence on the interhemispheric lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Access to essential and perceptual attributes of word meanings was investigated in a series of tasks. A total of 160 college students participated. First, perceptual attributes of a number of natural kind concepts were determined by asking participants to generate the most salient features of those concepts; they were asked to assess the importance of both those features and features that fit criteria for essential attributes. Attributes fitting the criteria for essential attributes were found to be judged more important than perceptual attributes in identifying an object and to have more connections to other attributes of the concept. Semantic priming for both types of features was then investigated. Prime-target pairs consisting of the natural kind concept term and the perceptual or essential attribute were presented for lexical decision (Exps 1a and 1b) or naming (Exps 2a and 2b). Interstimulus intervals (ISIs) were either 0 or 200 ms. Both types of features were primed at a 200 ms ISI but only in the lexical decision task.

Abstract = {Investigates the different rates at which young speakers of French appear to innovate in the use of adjectives of approval and disapproval. The principal research issues examined here are twofold: (1) the validity of the 'Pollyanna Principle', a concept in linguistic pragmatics adapted from the 'Pollyanna Hypothesis' of psychology, and designed to account for the preference on the part of speakers for avoiding or mitigating negative terms and expressions. This hypothesis is lent support by evidence adduced by I. Opie and P. Opie (1959), that negative terms used by children and adolescents tend to be stable, in contrast to the more rapid turnover of terms of approval. (2) Against this however, more recent sociolinguistic research in French suggests that variation in the lexis of French has a good deal of socio-stylistic value compared to the pronunciation level, and perhaps also the grammar. If true, this implies that French speakers coin lexical items (both negative and positive) more frequently than speakers of English (the language upon which the Opies based their suggestion). The aim of this article is therefore to examine the cross-linguistic validity of the Pollyanna principle, by analysing reported rates of lexical innovation in French.

Abstract = {Two experiments investigated why preschool children sometimes produce multiple words for a referent (i.e. POLYNOMY), but other times seem to allow only one word. In Experiment 1, 40 children (aged 3-4 yrs) completed a modification of G. O. Deák & M. Maratsos' (1998) naming task. Although social demands to produce multiple words were reduced, children produced, on average, more than two words per object. Number of words produced was predicted by receptive vocabulary. Lexical insight (i.e. knowing that a word refers to function or appearance) and metalexical beliefs (i.e. that a hypothetical referent has one label, or more than one) were not preconditions of polynomy. Polynomy was independent of bias to map novel words to unfamiliar referents. In Experiment 2, 40 children (aged 3-4 yrs) learned new words for nameable objects. Children showed a correction effect, yet produced more than two words per object. Children do not have a generalized one-word-per-object bias, even during word learning. Other explanations (e.g. contextual restriction of lexical access) are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants either named the words in the context of same- or different-category items, or produced the words together with their corresponding determiner. Ss were 24 German speakers. While in the former condition words were named faster in the context of same category items than of different-category items, the opposite pattern was obtained for the latter condition. These findings confirm the claim that the interfering effect of semantic context reflects competition in the retrieval of lexical entries in speaking.

Abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that increases in phonotactic probability facilitate spoken word processing, whereas increased competition among lexical representations is often associated with slower and less accurate recognition. We examined the combined effects of probabilistic phonotactics and lexical competition by generating words and nonwords that varied orthogonally on phonotactics and similarity neighbourhood density. The results from a speeded same-different task revealed simultaneous facilitative effects of phonotactics and inhibitory effects of lexical competition for real word stimuli. However, the nonword stimuli produced an apparently anomalous pattern of results. In a subsequent experiment, we identified the source of this anomaly by estimating behaviourally the specific lexical competitors activated by our nonwords. Our results suggest that, under specific circumstances, neighbourhood density and probabilistic phonotactics may combine to produce non-additive or synergistic effects of lexical competition on processing times.

Abstract = {Participants' eye movements were monitored as they followed spoken instructions to click on a pictured object with a computer mouse (e.g., 'click on the net'). Participants were slower to fixate the target picture when the onset of the target word came from a competitor word (e.g., ne(ck)t) than from a nonword (e.g., ne(p)t), as predicted by models of spoken-word recognition that incorporate lexical competition. This was found whether the picture of the competitor word (e.g., the picture of a neck) was present on the display or not. Simulations with the TRACE model captured the major trends of fixations to the target and its competitor over time. We argue that eye movements provide a fine-grained measure of lexical activation over time, and thus reveal effects of lexical competition that are masked by response measures such as lexical decisions.

Abstract = {A number of models of stuttering suggest that a problem with lexical retrieval is fundamental to the disorder. Such models predict, then, that lexical retrieval is a necessary condition for stuttering to occur. To investigate this prediction, this study looked at the effects of having persons who stutter speak in a way that does not involve lexical retrieval. If stuttering is a lexical retrieval problem, then stuttering should not occur under such conditions. In this study, 3 adults (aged 22-46 yrs) who stutter read aloud a standard English passage and two passages consisting of non-words, which were matched for length and initial sound to the words in the English passage. Stuttering occurred in all Ss at significant levels during the reading of the non-word passages. This finding is inconsistent with the idea that stuttering is caused by a problem with lexical retrieval. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the role of contextual distinctiveness (CD), a corpus-derived summary measure of the frequency distribution of the contexts in which a word occurs, as a predictor of lexical processing effort. Lexical decision responses were recorded as 18 individuals were presented with 165 word and 165 nonword stimuli. Results show that CD was a significantly better predictor of lexical decision latencies than occurrence frequency, suggesting that CD is the more psychologically relevant variable. Investigation of the relationship between CD and the 6 subjectively defined measures of concreteness, context availability, number of contexts, ambiguity, age of acquisition, and familiarity found CD to be reliably related to ambiguity only. It is concluded that CD is a more cognitively insightful variable than other lexical variables, particularly word frequency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Results of the noun–verb pair comprehension and production tests from the Test Battery for Auslan Morphology and Syntax (A. Schembri et al., 2000) are presented, reanalyzed, and compared to data from 2 other cases dealing with noun–verb pairs: the Auslan lexical database and a comparison of Auslan and American Sign Language (ASL) signs. The data confirm the existence of formationally related noun–verb pairs in Auslan in which the verb displays a single movement and the noun displays a repeated movement. The data also suggest that the best exemplars of noun–verb pairs of this type in Auslan form a distinct set of iconic (mimetic) signs archetypically based on inherently reversible actions (such as opening and shutting). This strong iconic link perhaps explains why the derivational process appears to be of limited productivity, though it does appear to have 'spread' to a number of signs that appear to have no such iconicity. There appears to be considerable variability in the use of the derivational markings, particularly in connected discourse, even for signs of the 'open and shut' variety. Overall, the derivational process is apparently still closely linked to an iconic base, is incipient in the grammar of Auslan, and is best described as only partially grammaticalized.

Abstract = {Visuospatial deficits are characteristic of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). A 58-yr-old woman had progressive dressing apraxia and environmental disorientation but continued to read voraciously. Positron emission tomography revealed hypometabolism of the occipitoparietal regions bilaterally, consistent with PCA. The symptoms suggested predominant dysfunction of the dorsal ('where') stream with abnormalities in visual localization and visuospatial integration; however, the patient also had a less pronounced apperceptive object agnosia. Further analysis of her preserved reading ability was performed. Familiar irregular words were read rapidly, but nonsense words were read slowly in a letter-by-letter fashion. She had a word superiority effect for embedded words and words with obscured letters but had difficulty reading stylized script or printing in unusual fonts. These findings suggest a dissociation between reading routes. Although the patient had a phonological dyslexia, her visuospatial processing was sufficient for access to preserved visual word forms for efficient lexical reading.

Abstract = {A specification of the structural characteristics of the mental lexicon is a central goal in word recognition research. Of various word-level characteristics, semantics remains the most resistant to this endeavor. Although there are several theoretically distinct models of lexical semantics with fairly clear operational definitions (e.g., in terms of feature sharing, category membership, associations, or cooccurrences), attempts to empirically adjudicate between these different models have been scarce. In this paper, the authors present several experiments in which they examined the effects of semantic neighborhood size as defined by two models of lexical semantics—one that defines semantics in terms of associations, and another that defines it in terms of global co-occurrences. Ss were college students. The authors present data that address the question of whether these measures can be fruitfully applied to examinations of lexical activation during visual word recognition. The findings demonstrate that semantic neighborhood can predict performance on both lexical decision and word naming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the neurological processes underlying sentence comprehension in 2nd-language (L2) learners. event related potential (ERP) data were recorded as 12 native Japanese speakers (aged 21–33 yrs) who had learned German as a 2nd language after puberty made judgments concerning heard German sentences that were correct, semantically incorrect, syntactically incorrect, or both semantically and syntactically incorrect. Results show that overall performance was not perfect but clearly above chance. Compared to native controls, L2 Ss exhibited similar ERP patterns concerning semantically incorrect sentences. Correct sentences elicited a greater positivity in L2 Ss than native controls, possibly reflecting greater difficulties in syntactic integration. For sentences containing a phrase structure violation, L2 Ss did not show significant modulations of the syntax-related ERP components usually seen in native Ss. Sentences containing a pure semantic or a combined syntactic and semantic violation elicited a late right anterior–central negativity, an effect not observed for native language processing. It is concluded that the additional processes observed in 2nd-language learners are based on conceptual–semantic rather than on lexical–semantic aspects.

Abstract = {Examined the role of neurolinguistic factors in stuttering by determining whether individuals who stutter display atypical neural functions for language processing, even with no speech production demands. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were obtained while 9 individuals who stutter (IWS) and 9 fluent speakers read sentences silently. The ERPs were elicited by: (a) closed-class words that provide structural or grammatical information, (b) open-class words that convey referential meaning, and (c) semantic anomalies. In standardized tests, IWS displayed similar grammatical and lexical abilities in both comprehension and production tasks compared to controls. Yet the ERPs elicited in IWS for linguistic processing tasks revealed differences in functional brain organization. The ERPs elicited in IWS were characterized by reduced negative amplitudes for closed-class words, open-class words, and semantic anomalies in a temporal window of approximately 200–400 ms after word onsets. Results indicate that alterations in processing for IWS are related to neural functions that are common to word classes and perhaps involve shared, underlying processes for lexical access.

Abstract = {Eye fixations during reading were monitored to examine the relationship between individual differences in working memory capacity—assessed by the reading span task—and inferences about predictable events. Context sentences predicting likely events, or non-predicting control sentences, were presented. They were followed by continuation sentences in which a target word represented an event to be inferred (inferential word) or an unlikely event (non-predictable word). A main effect of reading span showed that high working memory capacity was related to shorter gaze durations across sentence regions. More specific findings involved an interaction between context, target, and reading span on late processing measures and regions. For high- but not for low-span readers, the predicting condition, relative to the control condition, facilitated reanalysis of the continuation sentence representing the inference concept. This effect was revealed by a reduction in regression-path reading time in the last region of the sentence, involving less time reading that region and fewer regressions from it. Results show that working memory facilitates elaborative inferences during reading, but that this occurs at late text-integration processes, rather than at early lexical-access processes.

Abstract = {Compared the eye movements of 2 patients who read letter-by-letter (LBL) following a left occipital lobe lesion with those of 7 normal controls and 4 hemianopic Ss in a nonreading visual search task and a text reading task. While the LBL readers exhibited similar eye-movement patterns to those of the other 2 groups on the nonreading task, their eye movements differed significantly during reading, as reflected in the disproportionate increase in the number and duration of fixations per word and in the regressive saccades per word. Importantly, relative to the 2 control groups, LBL readers also made more fixations per word as word length increased, especially as word frequency and word imageability decreased. The alteration in the oculomotor behavior of the LBL readers during reading is similar to that seen in normal readers under difficult reading conditions, as well as in beginning readers and in those with developmental dyslexia, and appears to reflect difficulties in processing the visual stimulus. The interaction of length with frequency and with imageability in determining the eye movement pattern is consistent with an interactive activation model of normal word recognition in which weakened activation of orthographic input can nevertheless engage high-level lexical factors.

Daneman and E. Reingold (1993). Skilled readers in China and the United States read passages in their native language that contained occasional spelling errors. Results showed that under some circumstances very early phonological activation can be identified in English, but no evidence for early phonology was found in Chinese. In both languages, homophone errors showed a benefit in measures of later processing, suggesting that phonology helps readers recover from the disruptive effects of errors.

Abstract = {An optimal viewing position (OVP) for word recognition has been proposed by several authors. The location of this position would be at the center of the word or just left of it. Several hypotheses ranging from perceptual to hemispheric factors have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. In this experiment, the effect of the nature of the stimulus—word, pseudo-word, or nonword—on the existence and location of the OVP was tested in 21 Ss aged 18–34 yrs. Five-letter words, pseudo-words, and nonwords were presented, with the S fixating initially on 1 of the 5 possible letter positions. The number of letters correctly identified and reading performance were recorded for each stimulus. Results show that an initial fixation on the 3rd letter entails better letter identification for all kinds of stimuli. However, in terms of reading, only word reading benefits from a fixation on the 3rd letter. These results are discussed in relation to the different hypotheses of OVP in reading: hemispheric specialization, reading habits, and lexical constraints.

Abstract = {This article reports the findings of a study in which transfer of verb properties was investigated via syntactic data elicited from second language (L2) learners. It was hypothesized that a learner's first language (L1) would influence the acquisition of verbs in those L2 semantic classes where so-called L1-L2 translation equivalents could be found. To investigate lexical transfer, the performance of Hindi-Urdu speakers on tests of English causatives was compared with that of Vietnamese speakers, because there are significant differences between causativization patterns in Hindi-Urdu and Vietnamese. To account for proficiency-based variation in performance, learners were placed in one of three levels of lexical proficiency in English, and Mann-Whitney comparisons were made between Hindi-Urdu and Vietnamese speakers at corresponding proficiency levels. Results suggest that there is some transfer of semantic information from the L1 verb lexicon to the emerging L2 verb lexicon. More specifically, the findings suggest that verb properties are transferred selectively and that transfer plays a role in the difficulty or ease involved in the shedding of overgeneralized lexical rules.

Abstract = {This paper explores the possibility that, contrary to the findings of past studies, the Ll and L2 mental lexicon may in fact be structurally similar, with depth of individual word knowledge determining a given word's degree of integration into the mental lexicon. The paper begins by reviewing the body of evidence relevant to the research question, and then presents the design and results of an investigation comparing nonnative and native English speaker patterns of responses in light of depth of word knowledge scores. In discussing the results of the study, a tentative model for the process by which words are integrated into the mental lexicon is proposed, and the long-standing belief that a shift from predominantly syntagmatic to predominantly paradigmatic responses is indicative of lexical development is challenged.

Abstract = {The same 500 words were presented in 6 different word identification tasks (Experiment 1: lexical decision, semantic categorization, and 3 speeded naming tasks; Experiment 2: delayed naming). Reaction time (RT distributions were estimated for each task and analyses tested for the effects of word frequency and animacy on various parameters of the RT distribution. Low frequency words yielded more skewed distributions than high frequency words in all tasks except delayed naming. The differential skew was most marked for tasks that required lexical discrimination. The semantic categorization task yielded highly skewed distributions for all words, but the word frequency effect was due to shifts in the location of the RT distributions rather than changes in skew. The results are used to evaluate the relative contributions of a common lexical access process and task-specific processes to performance in lexical discrimination and naming tasks.

Abstract = {Addresses the question of whether constraints on aspectual semantics play a role in lexical processing. Two universal cognitive constraints are identified: 'states cannot be delimited' and 'telic predicates cannot be further telicized.' The study investigates how these are obeyed in the productive process of perfective preverb and stem combination in Bulgarian. Ss were 35 speakers of Bulgarian (aged 20–57 yrs). An off-line task ascertains that Bulgarian native speakers have a default semantic interpretation for the preverbs under investigation. A visual lexical decision task shows clear legality effects in nonwords composed of existing preverbs and stems, thereby supporting decompositional approaches. It is argued that, after the process of morpheme search, there must be a process of checking for combinatory felicity of the morphemes activated in the lexical access.

Abstract = {Examined the effects of different labeling patterns on the generalization of object names in 2 experiments. 51 2-yr-olds, 58 3-yr-olds, and 60 adults were shown 2 'standard' objects, which were named with the same label, with 2 different labels, or with no label at all. Ss were then asked whether objects morphed to be intermediate to the standards belonged to 1 of the labeled categories or, in the No Label condition, were 'like' one of the standards. The Same Label condition showed generalization to all intermediates, whereas the Different Label, and No Label conditions showed division of the intermediates into 2 separate categories, with somewhat sharper division under Different Label. These results suggest 2 possible mechanisms of lexical learning: 'boosting' the equivalence of different exemplars through label identity, and 'differentiating' the exemplars through differences in labeling. These studies provide evidence for boosting. It is concluded that learners are sensitive to the distribution of labels across exemplars, and they hold powerful assumptions about the relationship between these distributions and the underlying naming space. These findings have implications for the early emergence of cross-linguistic differences in lexical learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Argues that computational lexical semantics has reached a point in its development when it has become useful to compare the goals and methods of the various approaches to it. This article proposes several choices in terms of which these goals and methods can be discussed. It is argued that the central questions include the use of lexical rules for generating word senses; the role of syntax and formal semantics in the specification of lexical meaning; the use of a world model, or ontology, as the organizing principle for lexical-semantic descriptions; the relation between static and dynamic resources; the commitment to descriptive coverage; the tradeoff between generalization and idiosyncracy; and finally, the adherence to the 'supply side' (method-oriented) or 'demand side' (task-oriented) ideology of research. The discussion is inspired by, but not limited to, the comparison between the generative lexicon approach and the ontologic semantic approach to lexical semantics.

Abstract = {The goal of this article is to illustrate the application of self-organizing dynamics in the design of a model of lexical access. The authors focus particularly on the mapping of sound structure on to the lexicon and the influence of that structure on lexical access. The approach was tested in a series of 2 sets of simulations that explicate how lexical access might occur in normal Ss and aphasic patients. Both sets of simulations address the behavioral effects of both phonological and phonetic variability of prime stimuli on the magnitude of semantic priming. Results show that the model can successfully account for the behavioral effects associated with several kinds of acoustic manipulation, competitor presence, and the unfolding of those effects over time—primarily because it balances 3 important control parameters: resting lexical activation, positive feedback, and negative feedback. These simulations are offered as support (in the form of an existence proof) that deficits in the degree of lexical activation can account for the lexical processing impairments shown by Broca's aphasics who have reduced lexical activation, and Wernicke's aphasics who have increased lexical activation.

Abstract = {Over the last 25 yrs the continuing interest on ambiguity has resulted in an enormous amount of empirical work. Unfortunately, even within the restricted domain of lexical ambiguity resolution, which is the focus of this chapter, the findings have proved so difficult to reconcile in a coherent theoretical frame to justify the conclusion that the literature 'does not paint a very encouraging picture.... All the models of ambiguity processing have found support from one or more studies, and...there is no simple way of classifying studies methodologically in any way that sheds light on the discrepancies among results' (G. B. Simpson, 1994). The authors take up this challenge and explore whether discrepancies among studies can be explained. The available data, once reconsidered, may provide the empirical basis for a coherent theory of lexical ambiguity processing. The authors discuss 2 issues that are the most likely to explain--separately or in interaction--the discrepancies in the data, namely, the experimental paradigms and the types of contexts used in the different studies. Finally, some conclusions are drawn, focusing on how, in the domain of spoken word recognition, work on lexical ambiguity resolution complements our knowledge of lexical processing.

Abstract = {In the field of psycholinguistics there is increasing evidence that speakers and comprehenders are sensitive to statistical and probabilistic aspects of language. In contrast to theories that assume the general application of rules or heuristics, many current accounts of language processing adopt a constraint-based approach that considers detailed properties of lexical items. This trend results from empirical findings that comprehenders make processing decisions based on such detailed and usage-based information as the lexical frequence of a word and its contingent frequency in particular syntactic contexts in addition to its semantic content. While frequency of use in implicated in a number of the on-line processes involved in language comprehension and production, the effects have been most striking and most generally acknowledged in the study of lexical access.

Abstract = {Investigated how 6-mo-old infants, who have had a substantial amount of exposure to their native language, perceive lexical and grammatical words. Specifically the authors determined if the categorical discrimination evident in the neonatal period is evident at 6 mo of age, and if so, whether it is being harnessed in any way that might be of more direct relevance for breaking into language. Research was conducted in 3 studies. Ss for studies 1, 2, and 3 were 32, 13, and 13 full-term, healthy, monolingual English-learning 6-mo-olds, respectively. In Study 1, Ss were habituated to a list of either lexical or grammatical words and then tested on new list of words from the same and contrasting categories. The results indicate that the Ss showed recovery to lexical words after habituation to grammatical words (but not vice versa). In Studies 2 and 3, preference was assessed directly by presenting infants with alternating trials of lexical and grammatical words in the central-fixation preference procedure. The results indicate that Ss looked significantly longer during lexical-word than grammatical-word trials. These findings suggest that, by 6 mo, infants attend preferentially to lexical words.

Abstract = {College students named the colors in which high- and low-frequency words and pronounceable nonwords, otherwise matched, were displayed. Color naming was slower for all three item types than for visually equivalent strings of nonalphanumeric symbols but was no slower for words than for nonwords, nor for high-frequency words than for low-frequency words. Unpronounceable letter strings had intermediate color-naming latencies. However, frequency and lexical status had large effects on latency for reading the same words and pseudowords aloud. Interference is thus predicted not by the strength of association between a letter string and its pronunciation but by the presence of word-like constituents. We argue that the interference from an unprimed noncolor word is due to, and isolates, one of two components of the classic Stroop effect: competition from the whole task set of reading. The other component, response competition, occurs only when lexical access is sufficiently primed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Vocabulary tests are used for a wide range of instructional and research purposes, but there is no comprehensive basis for evaluating the current instruments or developing new lexical measures. This article presents a framework for vocabulary testing that begins with an analysis of test purpose and then shows how purpose can be systematically related to test design. The link between the 2 is based on 3 considerations which derive from S. Messick's (1989) validation theory: construct definition, performance summary and reporting, and test presentation. The components of the framework are illustrated by references to 8 vocabulary measures. For each vocabulary measure there is a description of its design and purpose. The way forward for vocabulary assessment is to take account of test purposes in the design and validation of tests, as well as considering an interactionalist approach to construct definition. This means that a vocabulary test should require learners to perform tasks under contextual constraints that are relevant to the inferences to be made about their lexical ability.

Abstract = {The functional and anatomical boundaries of 'Wernicke's area' have become so broad as to be meaningless. The authors reanalysed 4 functional neuroimaging studies to identify anatomically separable, functional subsystems in the left superior temporal cortex posterior to primary auditory cortex. From the results are identified a posterior stream of auditory processing. One part, directed along the supratemporal cortical plane, responded to both non-speech and speech sounds. Activity in its most posterior and medial part, at the junction with the inferior parietal lobe, was linked to speech production rather than perception. The second, more lateral and ventral part lay in the posterior left superior temporal sulcus, a region that responded to an external source of speech. In addition, this region was activated by the recall of lists of words during verbal fluency tasks. The results are compatible with an hypothesis that the posterior superior temporal cortex is specialized for processes involved in the mimicry of sounds, including repetition, the specific role of the posterior left superior temporal sulcus being to transiently represent phonetic sequences, whether heard or internally generated and rehearsed. These processes are central to the acquisition of long-term lexical memories of novel words. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined language function in the case of a male patient (aged 73 yrs) exhibiting profound global amnesia. At the age of 27, the S underwent a bilateral medial temporal lobe resection for intractable epilepsy, which resulted in profound global amnesia. The S was administered lexical memory, morphology, and syntactic processing tasks, and was assessed longitudinally with the Wechsler–Bellevue tests and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised (WAIS--R). Results show that the S performed normally on tests of lexical memory and grammatical function relative to controls. Longitudinal data gathered on 20 occasions during a 48-yr period indicated consistent cognitive performance across time, and provided no evidence of a lexical memory decrement. It is concluded that medial temporal lobe structures are not critical for retention and use of already acquired lexical information or for grammatical processing, but are required for acquisition of lexical information.

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine if the frequency or neighborhood density of words presented to children in the input would influence the gradual emergence of sounds through lexical diffusion. Longitudinal production data were obtained from eight children, ages 3;10 to 5;4. All of the children presented with functional phonological delays, as characterized by a severely reduced consonantal inventory in the absence of other associated linguistic, motor, cognitive, or social delays. This study provides partial evidence that input is a factor governing lexical diffusion in phonological acquisition. A word's frequency is particularly predictive of which words will undergo lexical diffusion and which will not. Input alone, however, cannot account for the full range of sound change observed in acquisition. Consequently, a conjunction of input, functional, featural, and contextual variables must be examined in tandem for a cohesive view of lexical diffusion in phonological acquisition.

New semantic similarity and dissimilarity rating tests with an empirically determined series of linguistic anchors and conventional, arbitrarily anchored semantic similarity ratings were compared. Contextual similarity was elicited by a sorting test based on substitution and yielding d-primes. The study found reliable correlations between the d-primes and the different ratings for semantic similarity and dissimilarity of the synonymous nouns across a wide continuum of meaning. The data strongly supported a contextual hypothesis of meaning. The data endorsed the claim that people abstract a contextual representation from experiencing the multiple natural linguistic contexts of a word. Semantic similarity and dissimilarity rating formats with an empirically chosen series of linguistic anchors and a sorting test of contextual similarity yielded stronger support for a contextual hypothesis than did alternative methods of eliciting lexical and contextual similarity.

Abstract = {In this study, children (aged 9–12 yrs) with the guessing subtype of dyslexia (who read fast and inaccurately) were compared with children with the spelling subtype (who read slowly and accurately) on three aspects of executive functioning (EF): response inhibition, susceptibility to interference from irrelevant information, and planning. It was found that guessers were impaired in their ability to inhibit inappropriate responding on all tasks used to assess EF (the stop signal task, the Stroop task, and the Tower of London task). This raises the question of whether the specific reading disorder of guessers may be linked to the same executive deficits which underlie ADHD. In order to unite a fast/inaccurate reading style with executive deficiencies, an attempt is made to incorporate the concept of executive control into models of lexical activation.

Abstract = {A single exposure to an object can produce long-lasting behavioral change. Here, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the authors provide evidence for long-lasting changes in cortical activity associated with perceiving and naming objects. In posterior regions, the authors observed, in 18 Ss, an immediate (30-sec) and long-lasting (3-day) decrease in neural activity after brief (200-ms) exposure to nameable and nonsense objects. In addition, slower-developing decreases in left inferior frontal activity were observed concurrently with increases in left insula activity, only for nameable objects. These time-dependent cortical changes may reflect two distinct learning mechanisms: the formation of sparser, yet more object-form-specific, representations in posterior regions, and experience-induced reorganization of the brain circuitry underlying lexical retrieval in anterior regions.

Abstract = {Reports the naming performance of a fluent aphasic (DP, 47 yrs old), who shows a striking dissociation between semantic and phonological (nonword) errors: he produced numerous semantic errors but virtually no phonological errors.

These patterns of performance are inconsistent with the proposal by G. S. Dell et al (see record [rid]1997-30055-007[/rid]) that the naming deficit in fluent aphasia is the result of global damage to all levels of the lexical access system and support instead the hypothesis that brain damage can selectively disrupt distinct subcomponents of the lexical processing system.

Abstract = {Reports the naming performance of a 73-yr-old patient with a fluent progressive aphasia who made phonological errors in all language production tasks. The pattern of errors in naming was strikingly clear: the S made very many phonological errors that resulted almost always in nonword responses. The complete absence of semantic errors and the very low ratio of formal errors relative to nonword errors in the S's performance are discussed in the context of recent claims about the nature of naming deficits in fluent aphasics. The authors argue that S's performance makes highly improbable the claim that fluent aphasia results from global lesions affecting all levels of the lexical access system equally.

Abstract = {Examined pragmatic factors that bias English-speaking children to produce more of the nouns and fewer of the verbs that they know. It is noted that if nouns are favored for production, parents should elicit more nouns than verbs in child speech; and if verb comprehension is favored over verb production, parents should more often prompt children to produce an action than to produce a verb. Data from videotaped 5-min free play sessions in a laboratory equipped playroom of 44 parent–child (aged 1.7 yrs) dyads in the New England directory of the CHILDES data base were analyzed. Results show that children produced more nouns than verbs but mothers produced more verbs than nouns. Speech act analyses indicate that mothers elicited noun production but rarely prompted children to produce verbs. Mothers more often prompted children to produce an action than to produce a verb, and verbs occurred most often in maternal speech acts used to elicit children's actions. Moreover, children comprehended many more verbs than they produced. It is concluded that these data suggest that production measures underestimate the frequency and significance of verb-learning in early lexical development.

Abstract = {The results of 2 Exps comparing processing of function words and content words are reported. In Exp 1, priming was present for both related function and related content word pairs, as measured in lexical decision response times for 40 Ss. In Exp 2, 34 Ss' eye movements were monitored as they read sentences containing either a high- or a low-frequency function or content target word. Function words showed frequency effects in 1st-fixation and gaze duration that were similar to those seen for content words. Clear differences in on-line processing of function and content words emerged in later processing measures. There was inflated processing time in the phrase immediately following a low-frequency function word, and Ss made more regressions to the target word in this condition than in the other 3 conditions. The priming effects in lexical decision and the word frequency effects in initial processing measures in silent reading for both word types were taken as evidence of common lexical processing for function and content words. The observed differences in later processing measures in the eye-movement data were taken as evidence of differences in the role that the 2 word types have in sentence processing beyond the lexical level.

Abstract = {In 2 experiments, the authors investigated the influence of word frequency in speeded word naming and in a relatively novel regularization task in which Ss were required to pronounce words on the basis of spelling-to-sound correspondences instead of giving their normal pronunciations (e.g., pronounce pint so that it rhymes with hint). 102 Ss were presented high- and low-frequency regular words and exception words, along with a set of nonwords. The results indicated that there was a normal word frequency effect (i.e., high-frequency words faster than low-frequency words) in the standard speeded naming task, whereas, for the regularization task, the word frequency effect was reversed for regular words, even though the regular words were pronounced in an identical fashion in both the normal naming and the regularization tasks. This reversal of the word frequency effect was not obtained for the exception words. The discussion focuses on the implication of these results for attentional control models of lexical processing.

Five anomic, 5 non-fluent aphasic and 5 normal control Ss (aged 52–79 yrs) were assessed by using a confrontation naming task which included monosyllabic, disyllabic and trisyllabic targets. All the aphasic Ss demonstrated successive phonological self-corrections towards the target. Initial consonants were more vulnerable to phonological disruption and more resistant to self-correction than vowels, lexical tones and final consonants.

Abstract = {The processing of semantic and structural information concerning the relation between a verb and its arguments is investigated in German in 2 experiments: In Exp 1, the verb precedes all its arguments, whereas in Exp 2 all arguments precede the verb. In both experiments, 16 participants (19–31 yrs of age) read sentences containing a semantic violation concerning the thematic role, a violation of the number of arguments, or a violation of the grammatical type of the argument (direct vs indirect object) indicated by case marking. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded during sentence reading. ERPs displayed different patterns for each of the violation types in the 2 experiments. The specific ERP patterns found for the different violation types indicate that the processes concerning the thematic role violation are primarily semantic in nature and that those concerning the grammatical type of argument are purely syntactic. The combined findings from the 2 experiments suggest that the parser uses verb-specific information to build up syntactic and thematic structures against which incoming arguments are checked and that the incoming verb has to be checked to allow lexical integration.

Abstract = {Examined how much knowledge of Japanese kanji stroke order and radicals contributes to overall kanji lexical knowledge. 91 native Japanese-speaking undergraduate students (mean age 20.9 yrs) participated. It was assumed that kanji writing skills (i.e., knowledge of kanji lexical orthography) would be supported by knowledge of precise stroke order sequence. However, a path model for kanji lexical knowledge, based on the results of this study, indicated that this is not true. In fact, the model shows that the only major contribution that knowledge of proper stroke order makes is to one's knowledge of radicals, and only in a limited way. In contrast, knowledge of kanji radicals directly supports all aspects of the kanji lexicon, namely phonology, orthography and semantics. Consequently, stroke order supports kanji lexical knowledge only indirectly via radicals. The path model also provided an illustration of the close interdependency between knowledge of kanji lexical phonology and knowledge of kanji lexical orthography, which also directly contributes to knowledge of kanji lexical semantics. This study suggests that stroke order plays only a minor role in kanji knowledge on the whole, but that knowledge of radicals serves as a basic element in acquiring kanji lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {Do nonselected lexical nodes activate their phonological information? Catalan-Spanish bilinguals were asked to name (a) pictures whose names are cognates, in the 2 languages (words that are phonologically similar in the 2 languages) and (b) pictures whose names are noncognates in the 2 languages. If nonselected lexical nodes are phonologically encoded, naming latencies should be shorter for cognate words, and because the cognate status of words is only meaningful for bilingual speakers, this difference should disappear when testing monolingual speakers. The results of Experiment 1 fully supported these predictions. In Experiment 2, the difference between cognate and noncognate words was larger when naming in the nondominant language than when naming in the dominant language. The results of the 2 experiments are interpreted as providing support to cascaded activation models of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Matras' paper (see record [rid]2001-00303-001[/rid]) arguing that the compartmentalization of structures observed in mixed languages (i.e. the fact that certain structural categories are derived from one 'parent' language, others from another) is the result of the cumulative effect of different contact mechanisms. The author explores the usefulness of Matras' typology of contact mechanisms for one specific type of contact setting, the variety of Turkish that is spoken in the Netherlands. Specifically, the relevance of the more common type of codeswitching (CS), insertional CS, to the genesis of mixed languages is discussed. It is concluded that whatever role insertional CS does play can be subsumed under the heading of lexical re-orientation, although it differs from typical cases of that phenomenon in one crucial aspect: insertional CS does not normally have the conscious functional motivations that typify lexical re-orientation.

Abstract = {Transcortical sensory aphasia (TSA) is characterized by impaired auditory comprehension with intact repetition and fluent speech. TSA was transiently induced by electrical interference during routine cortical function mapping in 6 adults (mean age 34 yrs) with seizure disorder. For each patient, TSA was associated with multiple posterior cortical sites, including the posterior superior and middle temporal gyri, in classical Wernicke's area. A number of TSA sites were immediately adjacent to sites where Wernicke's aphasia was elicited in the same patients. Phonological decoding of speech sounds was assessed by auditory syllable discrimination and found to be intact at all sites where TSA was induced. At a subset of electrode sites where the pattern of language deficits otherwise resembled TSA, naming and word reading remained intact. Language lateralization testing by intracarotid amobarbital injection showed no evidence of independent right hemisphere language. These results suggest that TSA may result from a one-way disruption between left hemisphere phonology and lexical-semantic processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the specific effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) by comparing the performance of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with the stimulator turned 'on' and 'off.' The performance of 56 patients on clinical tests of executive function was compared after 3 and 12 mo of DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the internal globus pallidus (GPi) with the stimulator 'on' or 'off.' Global intellectual efficiency, verbal learning, and mood were also evaluated with the stimulator 'on.' The performance of another group of 20 Ss was compared after 6 mo of DBS of the STN or the GPi with the stimulator 'on' or 'off' on tests recently shown to be more sensitive to L-dopa therapy. When the stimulator was 'on,' STN patients showed a mild but significant improvement in psychomotor speed and working memory. In comparison with the presurgical state, STN Ss had no cognitive deficit at 12 mo, except for lexical fluency. There was no differential effect of STN or GPi stimulation. It is concluded that: (1) the specific effect of DBS seems to mimic the action of L-dopa treatment in the cognitive as in the motor domain; and (2) the surgery associated with DBS does not appear to affect the cognitive performance of patients with PD 12 mo later, except for a mild deficit in lexical fluency.

Abstract = {Three experiments examine whether spatial attention and visual word recognition processes operate independently or interactively in a spatially cued lexical-decision task. Participants responded to target strings that had been preceded first by a prime word at fixation and then by an abrupt onset cue either above or below fixation. Targets appeared either in the cued (i.e., valid) or uncued (i.e., invalid) location. The proportion of validly cued trials and the proportion of semantically related prime-target pairs were manipulated independently. It is concluded that spatial attention and visual word recognition processes are best seen as interactive. Spatial attention affects word recognition in 2 distinct ways: (a) it affects the uptake of orthographic information, possibly acting as 'glue' to hold letters in their proper places in words, and (b) it (partly) determines whether or not activation from the semantic level feeds down to the lexical level during word recognition.

Results indicate that the nature and extent of mental energy displayed by Ss largely depended on their perception of the required outcome, relevant prior knowledge, and problem-solving skills. Findings suggest that vocabulary acquisition is an elaborative and iterative process, and that there are complex links between instructional tasks and learning outcomes. Findings also provide insight into the nature of the advantages of using text-based vocabulary exercises together with a reading text as opposed to using multiple reading texts for the learning of particular words and their lexical features.

Abstract = {Existing data from the Boston Naming Test were analyzed using standard statistical methods and with a General Processing Tree (GPT) model in an attempt to differentiate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular dementia (CVD), matched for severity. The sample consisted of 308 patients and 136 healthy, age-matched controls (mean age 67.5 yrs). The GPT approach enables the estimation of parameters reflecting underlying cognitive processes (e.g., perceptual analysis, lexical access) based on categorical data. Compared to traditional analyses of proportion correct and of errors, the analysis with the GPT model was more sensitive in detecting differences between patient groups, as well as the source of these differences. Among the differences were two' evident in a comparison between very mild AD and very mild CVD patients: standard analyses did not reveal a significant difference between these groups; but the GPT analysis revealed that the CVD patients had significantly higher estimates than the AD patients on parameters reflecting lexical access and phonological realization.

Abstract = {Using objective age of acquisition norms derived from children's naming data, this study showed that age of acquisition (AoA) effects do not depend upon the use of adult ratings. AoA has been reported to be a predictor of the speed of reading words aloud (word naming) and lexical decision, with early-acquired words being responded to faster than later-acquired words in both tasks. All previous studies of AoA effects have, however, relied upon adult estimates of word learning age the validity of which it is easy to cast doubt upon. 51 undergraduates participated in 1 of 2 experiments, in which Ss were presented with object names and recorded on reaction time. In addition to effects of real AoA, influences of word frequency and orthographic neighborhood size were obtained in both word naming and lexical decisions. Imageability affected lexical decision but not word naming, while the characteristics of the word's initial phoneme affected word naming but not lexical decision.

Abstract = {Three experiments looked at the processing of interlexical homographs by Dutch–English bilinguals. In Exp 1 we employed the translation recognition task to force the Ss to activate both language systems simultaneously. In this task, the processing of interlexical homographs was inhibited substantially compared to the processing of matched control words. In Experiments 2 and 3 we used the lexical decision task: In one condition we asked Ss to categorize letter strings as words or nonwords in Dutch; in a second condition we asked them to do so in English. The makeup of the stimulus set in Exp 2 permitted the Ss to ignore the instructions and to instantiate the task in a language-neutral form—that is, to categorize the letter strings as words in either Dutch or English. Under these circumstances, a small, frequency-dependent inhibitory effect for homographs was obtained, but only in condition Dutch. In Exp 3, Ss were forced in a language-specific processing mode by the inclusion of 'nonwords' that were in fact words in the non-target language. Large frequency-dependent inhibitory effects for homographs were now obtained in both language conditions. The combined results are interpreted as support for the view that bilingual lexical access is non-selective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Exps 1 and 2, the authors tested if the SI may be obtained when the distractor words are not part of the response set and when only one picture per semantic category is included in the experiment. In Exp 3, the impact of the distractor words as part of the response set on the magnitude of the SI effect was explored. Reliable SI effects were obtained in all 3 experiments and the magnitude of the effect did not vary as a function of whether or not distractor words are part of the response set.

Abstract = {The amygdala has been shown to respond to many distinct types of affective stimuli, including reward and punishment feedback in animals. In humans, winning and losing situations can be considered as reward and punishment experiences, respectively. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure regional brain activity when human subjects were given feedback on their performance during a simple response time task in a fictitious competitive tournament. Lexical stimuli were used to convey positive 'win' or negative 'lose' feedback. The frequency of positive and negative trials was parametrically varied by the experimenters independently from the subjects' actual performance and unbeknownst to them. The results showed that the parametric increase of winning was associated with left amygdala activation whereas the parametric increase of losing was associated with right amygdala activation. These findings provide functional evidence that the human amygdala differentially responds to changes in magnitude of positive or negative reinforcement conveyed by lexical stimuli.

Abstract = {Examined task-induced effects during visual lexical processing in a prime-target semantic priming paradigm with a total of 60 Ss (mean age 23 yrs). This research focused on target expectancy effects by manipulating the proportion of semantically related and unrelated word pairs. In Exp 1, a lexical decision task was used and reaction times (RTs) and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were obtained. In Exp 2, Ss silently read the stimuli, without any additional task demands, and ERPs were recorded. The RT and ERP results of Exp 1 demonstrate that an expectancy mechanism contributed to the priming effect when a high proportion of related word pairs was presented. The ERP results of Exp 2 show that in the absence of extraneous task requirements, an expectancy mechanism is not active. However, a standard ERP semantic priming effect was obtained in Exp 2. The combined results show that priming effects due to relatedness proportion are induced by task demands and are not a standard aspect of online lexical processing.

Abstract = {This longitudinal case study was designed to examine the possibility that a traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurring during the second year of life, while significant lexical and grammatical competencies are emerging, could have an impact on subsequent language development. The language development of a girl (BL) who suffered a TBI at 17 mo of age was monitored for 6 mo following the injury. Monthly parental checklists, free-play sessions, and word-learning tasks were used to measure her lexical and grammatical development. BL's results were compared with 2 control groups matched for age and gender. Overall, the results are consistent with the classical view of acquired language disorders in children. Despite an initial decrease in the use of her premorbid vocabulary, BL showed no durable significant impairment on any measure of lexical or grammatical development.

Abstract = {The influence of global discourse on the resolution of lexical ambiguity was examined in a series of naming experiments. Two-sentence passages were constructed to bias either the dominant or the subordinate meaning of a homonym that was embedded in a locally ambiguous sentence. The results provided evidence for the immediate (0-msec interstimulus interval) resolution of lexical ambiguity and were subsequently replicated in Experiment 2, in which an 80-msec stimulus onset asynchrony exposure duration was employed for the homonyms. Strong dominant and subordinate biased discourse contexts activated only the contextually appropriate sense of a homonym. In Experiment 3, each sentence of the discourse was presented in isolation. The pattern of activation obtained in Experiments 1 and 2 was found to be contingent on the integration of the two sentences to construct an overall global discourse representation of the text. The results support a context-sensitive model of lexical ambiguity resolution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined 2 related questions: (1) the effects of animacy on the production of different syntactic structures and word orders by Catalan-speaking children; and (2) the relationship between age and the production of different syntactic structures by these children. The results of a picture description experiment run with 74 Catalan-speaking 4.9–11.9 yr olds show that participants tended to produce more object dislocated descriptions when the patient was animate than when the patient was inanimate. The results also show that while the dislocation of object clauses is a construction already consolidated at 5, the passive structure is a construction still not fully acquired at 11. A comparison between the results obtained in the present experiment with existing results from similar experiments with English-speaking children shows that there is a cross-language difference in the age at which children start producing passive clauses. The authors argue that frequency of exposure to a particular syntactic structure is an important factor that contributes to the acquisition of that syntactic structure. The effects of animacy on the production of object-dislocated descriptions can be explained by means of conceptual and lexical accessability.

Abstract = {This chapter introduces phonological phenomena that occur in connected speech production and argues that they arise during the generation of the prosodic (or rhythmic) structure of an utterance. The claim is that, following the generation of the syntactic structure of an utterance, an intervening prosodic structure is generated that groups words into prosodic units that guide the phonological form of the utterance. The first section describes the connected speech phenomena of segmental structure, syllable structure, and stress and intonation structure. The next section describes the domains of the prosodic hierarchy and the application of phonological rules and phonetic processes. Psycholinguistic models of speech production are briefly discussed, and the few experimental studies that provide empirical data relevant to the production of prosody are noted. The final section describes research in speech perception and child language acquisition which investigates the role of prosody in the early stages of language processing. This research suggests that prosodic structure provides important information to the listener and to the language learner that can aid the processing of both lexical and syntactic structure.

Abstract = {The rationale for lexical studies rests on the assumption that the most meaningful personality attributes tend to become encoded in language as single-word descriptors, and studies have examined the factor structure of adjectival descriptors extracted from dictionaries. Using as an initial working hypothesis an Anglo/German version of the Big Five factor structure, the authors review lexical studies in English and 12 other languages, and examine their fit with the Big Five. The inclusion of highly evaluative terms and physical descriptors may lead to factors beyond the Big Five. With more conventional variable selections emphasizing disposition descriptors, indigenous structures resembling the Big Five emerge most readily in northern European languages. The Big Five have been only partially reproduced in many other studies, possibly reflecting differences in selection of variables. Factor structures with fewer factors may be more generalizable cross-culturally, perhaps because they are less affected by methodological variations. The influence of the major types of procedural differences on the resulting factor structures might account for what otherwise is prematurely interpreted as cultural differences. Suggestions for improving the lexical study paradigm are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The investigation of the neural basis of language occupies a unique place in the history of both neurology and neuroscience. It is fair to say that neurology began in earnest about a century and a half ago, around the study of language, and that what we now call neuroscience can be traced to that same effort. In this chapter, the authors take this dual status of language into account. They discuss language from the perspective of both neurology and neuroscience, mindful of the significance of language for both clinical practice and neuroscientific progress. Specifically, the authors present a number of findings relating a variety of language processes to a host of neural structures and operations. In an attempt to provide a perspective to interpret those findings, they briefly present a framework for discussing the neural basis of concepts and words. Previous evidence shows that the retrieval of knowledge for concrete entities from different conceptual categories depends on partially segregated neural systems. These findings have clarified further the neural correlates of knowledge retrieval; in this chapter, the authors outline their notion of how the neural circuitry subserving retrieval of conceptual and lexical knowledge operates.

By using a lexicon built to scale, it is shown that simple retrieval operations applied to a large corpus of words correctly predict an interaction of word frequency by spelling-to-sound regularity in naming, a frequency main effect in lexical decision, sensitivity to orthographically defined syllable-like structures in lexical decision, and an interaction of number of syllables with word frequency in naming. To illustrate their position, the authors sketch a model called LEX and show that the model can account for several lexical-decision and naming phenomena.

Normal (control) Ss were 21 1st graders, 22 2nd graders, 26 3rd graders, 20 4th graders, and 28 5th graders in France. Five 10–16 yr olds were diagnosed with surface dyslexia based on their performance on a neuropsychological battery. 66 4–9 letter words with varying phono-graphemic complexity were dictated to Ss. Quantitative analysis showed that the performance of dyslexic Ss was very similar to that of younger control Ss at the same reading level. Qualitative analysis of spelling errors showed that dyslexic Ss' knowledge of phonology-to-orthography correspondences was comparable to that of age-matched control Ss, whereas dyslexic Ss' lexical knowledge was very poor and was comparable to that of the youngest control Ss. The findings suggest that the spelling deficit associated with developmental surface dyslexia results from a cognitive disorder that interferes with lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {Comments on the application of a 2-stage model of lexical access in the study by D. Prins, V. Main and S. Wampler (see record [rid]1997-04432-010[/rid]) of lexicalization time in adults who stutter. Two problems with the study by Prins et al. are that (1) the assumption that the lexical access model of G. Kempen and P. Huijbers (1983) applied to their experiment is not supported by their data, and (2) the assumption that lexicalization time before speech onset is the difference between the speech-onset latency and the picture-recognition latency is debatable. The authors call into doubt the argument presented by Prins et al that lexicalization for verbs is hindering the speech planning process for speakers who stutter. Alternative models of lexicalization timing are proposed to establish the relationship between lexical access and stuttering. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the influence of strength of discourse bias on lexical ambiguity resolution. Short passages were constructed to bias polarized ambiguous words (homonyms) strongly or weakly toward the dominant or subordinate meanings. Using a self-paced reading task in Exp 1 with 26 undergraduates, it was demonstrated that in strongly biased discourse, reading times for homonyms in dominant discourse did not differ from those in subordinate discourse. However, when the discourse was weakly biased, homonyms were read faster in dominant discourse than in subordinate discourse. Exp 2 combined the reading paradigm with a naming task in order to provide an assessment of specific word-meaning activation in 32 undergraduates. Naming latencies for probe words revealed that only the contextually appropriate sense of a homonym was activated in strongly biased discourse. In contrast, both contextually appropriate and inappropriate senses were activated following a weakly biased subordinate discourse, whereas only the dominant sense was activated following weakly biased dominant discourse. Results demonstrate (1) an immediate influence of prior discourse information on lexical processing; and (2) that the strength of discourse constraints can play a governing role in lexical ambiguity resolution.

Abstract = {According to the multiple read-out model (J. Grainger & A. M. Jacobs, 1996), inhibitory neighborhood frequency effects should be observed in perceptual identification and semantic categorization tasks, and facilitatory neighborhood size effects should not. In Exps 1 and 2, 142 college students were used to examine these effects as a function of stimulus visibility. In the high-visibility conditions, words with large neighborhoods were reported less accurately than words with small neighborhoods. In the low-visibility conditions, low-frequency words with large neighborhoods and low-frequency words with higher frequency neighbors showed superior identification performance. 35 Ss participated in a semantic categorization task (Exp 3), words with large neighborhoods were responded to more rapidly than words with small neighborhoods, but there was no effect of neighborhood frequency. These results are inconsistent with 2 basic premises of the multiple read-out model—facilitatory neighborhood size effects are due to a variable response criterion, and that the lexical selection processes themselves produce an inhibitory neighborhood frequency effect. The results, in conjunction with previous findings, suggest that large neighborhoods aid lexical selection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A re-evaluation of the goals and techniques of generative grammar since the mid-1960s suggests that its mentalistic/biological program for describing language is still sound and has been borne out by subsequent developments. Likewise, the idea of a generative system of combinatorial rules has led to a tremendous expansion of our understanding of linguistic phenomena. However, certain fundamental features of the versions of generative grammar based on Chomsky's work prevent the theory from making deep liaisons with related fields such as language processing and neuroscience. Perhaps the most prominent of these is the assumption that all creative aspects of language stem from syntactic structure. In this article, I propose a model of generative grammar that generalizes features of several, alternative, non-Chomskyan generative frameworks. In this model, language is seen as composed of three independent generative components (phonological, syntactic, and semantic/conceptual structure), whose respective structures are placed in correspondence by 'interface components'. Besides being able to incorporate a host of purely linguistic facts, this view leads to a more direct relationship between the theory of grammar and the theory of lexical and grammatical processing.

In 3 experiments, 20 3-yr-olds, 20 5-yr-olds, and 20 adults were presented with sets of objects consisting of a target, a same-shape/different-function match, a different-shape/same-function match, and a distracter. In Exp 1 and 2, function was emphasized during the word learning phase and participants were given direct experience with the functions of target and test objects. In Exp 3, function was emphasized both during the learning phase and when requesting a referent of the novel labels. Across all 3 experiments, 3- and 5-yr-olds focused on shape while adults focused on function when extending the novel words.

Abstract = {Exp 1 examined the explicit reading of words and pseudowords using 6 males with developmental dyslexia. Ss received a battery of test and experimental measures designed to assess literacy and literacy related skills. Exp 2, using 6 male dyslexics, examined the implicit reading of words and pseudowords. Ss were given the same psychometric test battery as used in Exp 1. The dyslexics performed less well than their peers on a range of literacy tasks and were strikingly impaired on phonological tasks. In the reading aloud experiment, simple words and pseudowords were presented at a slow pace so that reading accuracy was equal for dyslexics and controls. Relative to rest both normal and dyslexic groups activated the same peri- and extra-sylvian regions of the left hemisphere that a known to be involved in reading. The dyslexic readers showed reduced activation in BA 37 relative to normals suggesting that this group difference, seen in both experiments, resides in highly automated aspects of the reading process. Results confirm previous findings that dyslexic readers process written stimuli atypically, based on abnormal functioning of the left hemisphere reading system. More specifically, the authors localize this deficit to the neural system underlying lexical retrieval. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In addition, the researchers examined whether emotional content improves the performance of patients with left brain damage (LBD) and language deficits. Ss were 11 patients (mean age 67.1 yrs) with right brain damage (RBD), 10 patients (mean age 63.2 yrs) with LBD, and 15 normal control adults (mean age 64.8). Parallel emotional experimental and nonemotional control tasks included word identification (or recognition), sentence identification, and word discrimination. There were 8 emotional categories (e.g., happiness) and 8 nonemotional categories (e.g., vision). Patients with RBD were significantly impaired relative to patients with LBD and normals within the emotional condition, particularly for the identification tasks. Furthermore, the performance of patients with LBD and language deficits was improved by emotional content for the sentence identification task. These findings suggest that the right hemisphere has a unique contribution in the identification of lexical emotional stimuli. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the locus of Stroop-like interference and facilitation effects on the processing of line-drawn picture categorizing. The study used a unique version of Stroop-like picture categorizing task, in which both target and distracting stimuli were pictures, from which semantic information can be processed without lexical processing. To examine the effect of lexical phonological processing on reaction, Ss were divided into 2 groups of reaction type, key press and verbal reaction group, and responded to the category of the target pictures ignoring distracting pictures. To examine the effect of semantic relations on the amount of interference, the following conditions were presented under the combination of target and distracting pictures: same stimulus, same category, different category, neutral, and control. Time course of processing was examined by varying the stimulus onset asynchrony between target and distractor. Stroop-like interference effect was seen for both types of reaction groups, but facilitation effect was significantly only on verbal reaction group. The authors suggest that the cause of interference is semantic, lexical, and phonological processing, whereas the cause of facilitation is mainly lexical, phonological processing.

Rayner (see record [rid]1998-04518-009[/rid]) initially replicated the results, using eye-tracking methodology. On further examination of the stimuli, Binder and Rayner eliminated 43% of the stimulus set and found that context strength failed to modulate meaning frequency. Binder and Rayner's initial replication of Kellas et al and the convergence of results between their two main experiments established the validity of self-paced reading as a measure of on-line reading, when compared with eye-tracking methodology. However, their central conclusion, that context strength cannot modulate the subordinate bias effect, is open to question. This commentary examines the criteria adopted to exclude items from a homonym set and discusses the issue of local versus published norms. Also discusses the issue of context strength, as related to the specific rating procedures employed. Finally, the authors conclude that strong context can, in fact, eliminate the subordinate bias effect and that the context-sensitive model can more fully account for the available data on lexical ambiguity resolution.

In Experiment 2, only orthographically illegal nonwords were used; in Experiment 3, pseudohomophone nonwords; in Experiment 4, articulatory suppression by the recitation of a nursery rhyme; and in Experiment 5, articulatory suppression by the repetition of a single word. The same basic pattern of results was observed in all experiments: There were main effects of both AoA and frequency, which interacted in such a way that the AoA effect was larger for low- than for high-frequency words. Although the AoA effect was reduced by manipulations intended to interfere with phonological processing, the manipulations did not eliminate the effect. The results are discussed in terms of current models of reading in which it is proposed that AoA has its primary effect on the retrieval of lexical phonology, which appears to be consulted automatically in the lexical decision task.

Abstract = {Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) are reported to show mild, but reliable, difficulties reading aloud and spelling to dictation exception words, which have unusual or unpredictable correspondence between their spelling and pronunciation (e.g., touch). To understand the cognitive dysfunction responsible for these impairments, 21 patients and 27 age- and education-matched controls completed specially designed tests of single-word oral reading and spelling to dictation. AD patients performed slightly below controls on all tasks and showed mildly exaggerated regularity effects (i.e., the difference in response accuracy between words with regular spellings minus exception words) in reading and spelling. Qualitative analyses, however, did not demonstrate response patterns consistent with impairment in central lexical orthographic processing. The authors conclude that the mild alexia and agraphia in AD reflect semantic deficits and nonlinguistic impairments rather than a specific disturbance in lexical orthographic processing.

Abstract = {Phonological recoding in a logographic script was examined in 4 experiments. Two factors were manipulated: orthographic and phonemic resemblance of the target to the correct word. The first 2 experiments, which used a verification task, showed that activation of the target's phonological code preceded the retrieval of its semantic code. When the target was masked (Experiment 2), the homophone effect was not dampened although accuracy was affected, suggesting that phonological activation is independent of lexical identification. The results of the idiom judgment task (Experiments 3 and 4) also supported the phonological recoding interpretation. It is argued that information about the logograph's overall configuration carried by the early-arriving low spatial frequency components allows the computation of a 'prelexical' phonological code, although this information is not sufficient for lexical identification.

DLI participants were sensitive to whole-word frequency and show little or no transparency effects. These results are interpreted as indicating that words are not organized according to 'morphological families' in the DLI mental lexicon, but rather according to a principle of frequency.

This finding suggests that in languages with rich morphology, not all multimorphemic words are accessed in a decomposed form.

Results show that Ss committed errors, significantly varied their strategies for naming dimensions between cases, and showed a lack of consistency between cases. It is concluded that descriptions of dimensional terms do not capture all of the regularities regarding the use of these terms in adult language. Other factors, such as global characteristics, should be taken into account in semantic descriptions.

Abstract = {Examined errors of lexical form during the early stages of 2nd-language acquisition among adults. Participants were 39 English-dominant graduate and undergraduate students bilingual in English and Spanish, who performed a translation recognition task in which they decided whether the 2nd of 2 words was the correct translation of the 1st word. The words were not correct translation equivalents, but related by lexical form (e.g., man–hambre [hunger] instead of man–hombre [man]) or by meaning (e.g., man–mujer [woman] instead of man–hombre [man]). Response latencies and accuracy for translation recognition judgments were assessed as a function of 2nd language fluency and word pair language order and type of relatedness. Results show that less fluent Ss experienced more interference for form-related than for semantically-related words, relative to unrelated controls. The reverse was true for more fluent Ss. The results support a progression from reliance on word form to reliance on meaning with increasing 2nd language proficiency. The performance of the more fluent Ss further suggests that the ability to retrieve semantic information directly for 2nd-language words might override costs associated with lexical competition in languages that access shared lexical features.

Abstract = {By most theories of lexical access, idiosyncratic aspects of speech (such as voice details) are considered noise and are filtered in perception. However, episodic theories suggest that perceptual details are stored in memory and mediate later perception. By this view, perception and memory are intimately linked. The present study tested this hypothesis by creating symmetric illusions, using words and voices. In two experiments with 136 college students, listeners gave reduced noise estimates to previously heard words, but only when the original voices were preserved. Conversely, in two recognition memory experiments, listeners gave increased old responses to words (or voices) presented in relatively soft background noise. The data suggest that memory can be mistaken for perceptual fluency, and perceptual fluency can be mistaken for memory. The data also underscore the role of detailed episodes in lexical access.

Abstract = {Response time (RT) distributions obtained from 3 word recognition experiments were analyzed by fitting an ex-Gaussian function to the empirical data to determine the main effects and interactive influences of word frequency, repetition, and lexicality on the nature of the underlying distributions. The ex-Gaussian analysis allows one to determine if a manipulation simply shifts the response time (RT) distribution, produces a skewing of the RT distribution, or both. In contrast to naming performance, the lexical decision results indicated that the main effects and interactions of word frequency, repetition, and lexicality primarily reflect increased skewing of the RT distributions, as opposed to simple shifts of the RT distributions. The implications of the results were interpreted within a hybrid 2-stage model of lexical decision performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) state was induced in participants to test the theory that iconic gestures have a functional role in lexical access. 60 participants were given rare word definitions from which they had to retrieve the appropriate lexical item, all of which had been rated high in imageability. Half were free to gesture and the other half were instructed to fold their arms. The TOT theory would predict that the TOT state should be associated with iconic gesture and that gestures would assist in this lexical retrieval function. The study found that gestures were associated with lexical search. Furthermore, gestures were sometimes iconic and sufficiently complex and elaborate that naive judges could discriminate the lexical item the speaker was searching for from a set of five alternatives, at a level far above chance. But often the gestures associated with lexical search were not iconic in nature, and furthermore there was no evidence that the presence of the iconic gesture itself actually helped the speaker find the lexical item they were searching for. This experimental result has important implications for models of linguistic production, which posit an important processing role for iconic gestures in the processes of lexical selection.

Abstract = {The impact of phonotactic probabilities on serial recall was investigated in a series of experiments. In Experiments 1A and 1B, 7 and 8 year olds were tested on their serial recall of monosyllabic words and of nonwords varying in phonotactic frequencies. A recall advantage to words over nonwords remained when stimuli were balanced for phonotactic probability, but nonword recall showed superior accuracy for high over low probability nonwords, as in Experiment 2. The nonword frequency effect appears to reflect the frequency of constituent syllables rather than biphones. Both lexicality and high phonotactic frequency led to increased proportions of full over partial recall of the memory stimuli. These findings indicate that decayed memory traces in phonological short-term memory can be reconstructed using either lexical or phonotactic knowledge.

Ss' reaction time (RT) and error rates were studied with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The results were (1) morpheme units played some role in the recognition of words; (2) the activation of morpheme units shifted while that of whole word units was constantly strengthened; (3) the information of morpheme position mainly occurred in later period of lexical access.

Names of mammals (M), birds (B), and tools (T) were presented acoustically to 10 Japanese Ss (mean age 32.3 yrs) in an S1-S2 paradigm. S1 and S2 belonged to the same or to different categories. Reaction times and N400 latency were found to be longer and the error rate was larger when S1 and S2 belonged to more related categories (condition MB) than to more distant categories (conditions MT and BT). This demonstrated that category matching is easier when the semantic categories of words are more closely related. The results are interpreted as arguing for the import of post-lexical processes of word recognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Second through 6th graders were presented with nonword primes (orthographic, pseudohomophone, and control) and target words displayed for durations (30 and 60 ms) that were brief enough to prevent complete processing. Word reading skills were assessed by 3 word and nonword naming tasks. Good readers exhibited more orthographic priming than poor readers at both durations and more pseudohomophone priming at the short duration only. This suggests that good readers activate letter and phonemic information more efficiently than poor readers. Good readers also exhibited an equal amount of priming at both durations, whereas poor readers showed greater priming at the longer duration. This suggests that activation was not under strategic control. Finally, priming was reliable for both high- and low-frequency targets. This suggests that readers activate consistent information regardless of target word characteristics. Thus, quick, automatic, and general activation of orthographic and phonological information in skilled readers results from the precision and redundancy of their lexical representations.

Abstract = {Inhibition of return refers to a bias against returning attention to a location or object that has been recently attended. Recent research has shown that inhibition of return can be found not only in simple detection tasks, but also in tasks requiring relatively simple discrimination judgments. Using undergraduates, the present experiments examined whether inhibition of return occurs in word/nonword tasks that require complex discriminations such as lexical decision and categorization tasks. Not only was inhibition of return found in both experiments, but a greater amount of inhibition was found for low-frequency words than for high-frequency words. These findings suggest that inhibition of return not only inhibits returning attention to previously attended locations, but can also affect the processing that is required for lexical access.

Abstract = {A series of experiments assessed masked priming for letters and words that are visually similar (SIM) and dissimilar (DIS) in upper- and lowercase formats. For letters, robust DIS priming was obtained in a naming task, but this priming did not extend to a variety of non-naming tasks. For words, robust DIS priming was obtained in both naming and non-naming tasks. SIM letter and word priming extended to all tasks, but the effects were generally small for letters. The restricted set of conditions for DIS letter priming suggests that this priming is mediated by phonological-articulatory processes, and the generality of DIS word priming argues that abstract orthographic codes mediate these effects. Consistent with this conclusion, priming between homophones (for both letters and words) was found in a naming task, but little word homophone priming was obtained in a lexical decision task.

Abstract = {Investigated whether the phonological properties of visually presented words routinely influence the process of lexical access. Recent models of developing reading suggest that the potential for such phonological effects may vary as a function of reading experience. Four experiments were conducted, two with adults (college students), and two with children (aged 9–10 yrs). A masked priming procedure was employed, in which the critical measurement was the facilitation observed in the recognition of a target word when it was preceded by a briefly masked exposure of a phonologically identical stimulus. The results indicated no priming of a target word from a phonologically identical prime for the adult Ss. This was the case even for primes and targets that had a high degree of orthographic overlap. The children also showed little evidence for masked phonological priming, although there was some indication that individual differences may exist, with some children using phonological information and others not. In general, the results provide little support for the claim that the phonological attributes of words are standardly used to achieve lexical access.

Abstract = {In Experiments 1, 2, and 3, listeners categorized fricatives at the ends of nonwords and words and the immediately following word-initial stops. When nonwords were the context stimuli, categorization of both the fricatives and the stops was influenced by the transitional probabilities of the vowels into the fricatives. When words were used, the transitional probabilities into the fricatives were matched. No compensation on following stops was found, even though the fricatives tended to be labeled in a lexically consistent manner. In Experiment 4, where listeners simply categorized stops at the ends of nonwords, further evidence of sensitivity to the transitional probabilities of these consonants was obtained. These results challenge interactive models, but are accounted for most parsimoniously by autonomous models in which transitional probabilities are represented independently of lexical information.

Abstract = {Behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) correlates of lexical processing and repetition priming were examined in 11 stroke patients (aged 26–77 yrs) with lesions centered in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 46). Patients were subdivided into anterior and posterior frontal subgroups. Visually presented words and pronounceable non-words were repeated after 1 of 3 delays. Ss categorized stimuli as either words or non-words in a lexical decision task. Controls showed significant word priming at all 3 delays. Old words elicited more positive-going potentials than did new words, beginning at 300 msec and lasting until 500–700 msec. This ERP repetition effect was reduced, but not eliminated, by the presence of both anterior and posterior frontal lesions. However, behavioral priming was intact, suggesting that prefrontal cortex may modulate the neural generators in posterior cortical regions that are critical for priming. Left posterior frontal lesions resulted in impaired performance in the lexical decision task and a reduction in the amplitude of the late positive component. These latter findings suggest that left posterior prefrontal cortex is important for the categorization and selection processes required by lexical–semantic tasks.

Abstract = {In 5 cross-modal picture–word interference experiments, the authors investigated the time course of lexicalization in speech production. Participants named pictures of simple objects while hearing distractor words at different stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs). Distractors were semantically related or phonologically related to either the picture name or its nontarget near-synonym. Compared with an unrelated control, effects from all distractors were obtained at a late SOA (150 ms) and vanished shortly thereafter (at SOA = 300 ms). These findings conflict with the notion of an early selection of a single element. Rather, multiple lexical representations appear to remain active until late in the production process if a near synonymous lexical competitor is present. The authors discuss the scope of these observations and their relevance for discrete 2-stage and cascaded models of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the roles of the left lateral anterior temporal cortex, posterior temporal cortex, and inferior frontal cortex in sentence processing, and the level of activation of these areas during processing of word lists, simple sentences, complex sentences, and sentences with syntactic ambiguities. 12 students (aged 19–24 yrs) participated. Results show that these 3 areas of the left hemisphere play different roles in sentence comprehension. The posterior middle and superior temporal gyrus showed activation correlated with the structural complexity of a sentence, suggesting that this area supports processing of sentence structure. The lateral anterior temporal gyrus was more activated bilaterally by all sentence conditions than by word lists; thus the function of the area probably does not directly support processing of structure but rather processing of words specific to a sentence context. The left inferior frontal cortex also showed activation related to sentence complexity but was also more activated in word list processing than in simple sentences; this region may thus support a form of verbal working memory which maintains sentence structural information as well as lexical items.

Abstract = {Results from a series of naming experiments with a total of 503 undergraduates demonstrated that major lexical categories of simple sentences can provide sources of constraint on the interpretation of ambiguous words (homonyms). Manipulation of verb (Exp 1) or subject noun (Exp 2) specificity produced contexts that were empirically rated as being strongly biased or ambiguous. Priming was demonstrated for target words related to both senses of a homonym following ambiguous sentences, but only contextually appropriate target words were primed following strongly biased dominant or subordinate sentences. Exp 3 showed an increase in the magnitude of priming when multiple constraints on activation converged. Exps 4 and 5 eliminated combinatorial intralexical priming as an alternative explanation. Instead, it was demonstrated that each constraint was influential only insofar as it contributed to the overall semantic representation of the sentence. Exp 6 examined the issue of homonym exposure duration by using an 80-msec stimulus onset asynchrony. The overall evidence indicates that a sentence context can be made strongly and immediately constraining by the inclusion of specific fillers for salient lexical categories.

Abstract = {Reports 6 studies on late closure in the resolution of attachment ambiguities in Spanish against a backdrop of principle-motivated vs frequency-based models of sentence parsing. All Ss were Spanish speaking adults. Results of a questionnaire study on attachment preferences and 3 self-paced reading experiments show a clear preference towards low attachment (late closure), thus supporting principle-grounded theories. In addition, two corpus studies involving written Spanish sentences were carried out to obtain records of relative frequencies of the attachment choices involved in initial experiments. A coarse-grained measure revealed that, in accordance with linguistic tuning, low-attachment structures are more common in Spanish NP-VP1-NP-VP2-PP sentences. However, a fine-grained count showed that low-attachment preferences cannot be explained by arguing that the specific verbs positioned lower on the tree (VP2) are more likely to take an extra argument than those located at a higher position (VP1), as lexical models would assume.

Abstract = {A controversial phenomenon concerning slips of the tongue is the tendency for the onsets of words to slip more frequently than segments at other word positions. Some researchers attribute this effect to the phonological properties of word onsets, while others suggest it reflects something specific about the role played by the word onset during phonological recovery and/or sequencing. This study examined these two possibilities using a tongue-twister paradigm in which 10 Ss were asked to repeatedly recite a visually-presented word quadruple. The lexical status of the words was manipulated independently of their broader phonological characteristics by altering their constituent vowels. Errors elicited on real word targets were found to exhibit a strong word onset effect; this effect was entirely confined to between—word contextual errors. However, nonword targets generated no word onset effect, either overall or on between—word errors considered alone. These findings suggest that the word onset effect cannot be entirely attributed to phonological factors, but instead reflects the larger role word onsets play in speech planning. A new account is offered, which attributes the word onset effect to order-based competition between items at the lexical level. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined acquired dysgraphia observed in a 75-yr-old French-speaking woman. The results point to an impairment of the graphemic buffer, i.e., the processing stage where abstract orthographic representations are temporarily stored while planning the written production. However, the spelling errors were more frequent in the irregular than in the regular words, A qualitative analysis of the errors in the irregular misspelled words showed that these were not 'regularization' errors, but rather the same characteristics as the phonologically implausible errors found in the regular words, such as letters substitutions, deletions, additions, and transpositions. Furthermore. in a list of regular and irregular words of same length and graphemic structure, the errors not only tended to concentrate on the irregularity itself but also tended to be more frequent elsewhere in the irregular words compared to the regular words. The findings are discussed in terms of a post-lexical sensitivity to irregular spelling. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study investigated 7-month-old infants' ability to relate vowel sounds with objects when intersensory redundancy was present versus absent. Infants (N = 48) were habituated to two alternating video-films of vowel-object pairs in one of three conditions. In the moving-synchronous condition, where redundancy was present, the movement of one object was temporally coordinated with the spoken vowel /a/ and that of the other with /i/, simulating showing and naming the objects to the infant. In the still and in the moving-asynchronous conditions, where redundancy was absent, infants saw static objects, and objects moving out of synchrony with the vowel sounds, respectively. The results indicated that infants detected a mismatch in the vowel-object pairs in the moving-synchronous condition but not in the still or the moving-asynchronous condition. These findings demonstrate that temporal synchrony between vocalizations and the motions of an object facilitates learning of arbitrary speech-object relations, an important precursor to the development of lexical comprehension in infancy.

Abstract = {Used the N400 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) as a processing marker of single spoken words presented during sleep to 13 healthy Ss (aged 19–25 yrs). The auditory ERPs were registered in response to a semantic priming paradigm made up of pairs of words (50% related, 50% unrelated) presented in the waking state and during sleep stages II, III–IV and REM. The amplitude, latency and scalp distribution parameters of the negativity observed during stage II and the REM stage were contrasted with the results obtained in the waking stage. The N400-like effect elicited in these stages of sleep showed a mean amplitude for pairs of unrelated words significantly greater than for related pairs and an increment of latency. The results suggest that during these sleep stages a semantic priming effect is maintained actively although the lexical processing time increases.

Abstract = {Previous research (E. E. Garber and D. B. Pisoni, 1991; D. B. Pisoni and E. E. Garber, 1990) has demonstrated that subjective familiarity judgments for words are not differentially affected by the modality (visual or auditory) in which the words are presented, suggesting that participants base their judgments on fairly abstract, modality-independent representations in memory. However, in a recent large-scale study in Japanese (S. Amano et al, 1995), marked modality effects on familiarity ratings were observed. The present research further examined possible modality differences in subjective ratings and their implications for word recognition. Specially selected words were presented to 160 Ss for frequency judgments. In particular, Ss were asked how frequently they read, wrote, heard, or said a given spoken or printed word. These ratings were then regressed against processing times in auditory and visual lexical decision and naming tasks. Results suggest modality dependence for some lexical representations.

Abstract = {Cross-modal priming experiments have shown that surface variations in speech are perceptually tolerated as long as they occur in phonologically viable contexts. For example, [fre[i]p] (frayp) gains access to the mental representation of freight when in the context of [fre[i]pbeara] (frayp bearer) because the change occurs in normal speech as a process of place assimilation. The locus of these effects in the perceptual system was examined. Sentences containing surface changes were created that either agreed with or violated assimilation rules. The lexical status of the assimilated word also was manipulated, contrasting lexical and nonlexical accounts. Two phoneme monitoring experiments showed strong effects of phonological viability for words, with weaker effects for nonwords. It is argued that the listener's percept of the form of speech is a product of a phonological inference process that recovers the underlying form of speech. This process can operate on both words and nonwords, although it interacts with the retrieval of lexical information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined whether differences among 1st languages (L1) affect word recognition in reading a 2nd language (L2). 16 participants had Indonesian (an alphabetic language) and 16 had Chinese (a logographic language) as L1 and were learning English (an alphabetic language) as L2. Ss engaged in a lexical decision task using English words. Under the connectionist rubric, it was predicted that an alphabetic L1 would facilitate word recognition in an alphabetic L2, especially if the L1 and L2 have similar spelling patterns.  Results support the connectionist word recognition model. The better performance of the Indonesian Ss, relative to the Chinese Ss, suggests that the Indonesian readers developed a relatively strong interletter associative network through their L1 experience, which they transferred to the lexical decision task.  In contrast, the Chinese readers, who were accustomed to processing primarily logographic characters in their L1, did not have the advantage of transferring such L1 knowledge. The results substantiate the hypothesis that an L1 interletter associative network would facilitate L2 word recognition when L1 and L2 have similar orthographic systems. Materials used in the lexical decision task are appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Four experiments examined the effects of the rated age of acquisition (AoA) and word frequency on oral reading latencies and word pronunciation durations. In Experiment 1, both AoA and frequency had independent (and noninteracting) effects on naming latencies. Experiment 2 found no effect of either AoA or frequency on delayed naming, indicating that prepared articulation time was not a factor contributing to the naming latencies observed in Experiment 1. Experiment 3 reported 2 replications of the study by C. M. Morrison and A. W. Ellis (1995). Both replications found reliable effects of frequency and AoA, whereas Morrison and Ellis found an effect of AoA but no effect of frequency. Experiment 4 found a strong AoA effect on pronunciation durations, with a smaller and less reliable effect of frequency. It was concluded that frequency affects the visual recognition of words and that AoA affects the production of lexical phonology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the reading ability of CP, a pure alexic adult patient, using an experimental paradigm that is known to elicit the viewing position effect in normal readers. The viewing position effect consists of a systematic variation of word recognition performance as a function of fixation location within a word: Word recognition is best when the eyes fixate slightly left from the word center and decreases when the eyes deviate from this optimal viewing position. A mathematical model (T. A. Nazir et al, 1991), which provides a good description and quantification of the prototypical shape of the viewing position effect, served to interpret CP's reading performance. The results showed that, like normal readers, CP was able to process all letters of a word in one fixation. However, in contrast to normal readers, reading performance was optimal when CP was fixating the right half of the word. This somewhat abnormal pattern of performance was due to (1) poor perceptual processing in the right visual field, and (2) poor processing of letters situated towards the end of the word, independent of visual field presentation. It is suggested that CP's reading impairment stems from a dysfunction in the coupling between incoming visual information and stored lexical information.

Abstract = {To determine the influence of stimulus lexicality on the magnetic mismatch field (MMF), in the present study the MMF was recorded in response to non-word deviants presented in the context of both and non-word standards. Sixteen right-handed native speakers of German (aged 22–37 yrs) were presented with an oddball sequence of 2400 auditory words and non-words. The speech-evoked MMF was measured using a 49-channel gradiometer. The equivalent current dipole fitted to the mismatch field was deeper inside the brain and its dipole moment was stronger for non-word than word standards. The factor structure of field amplitude, source dipole moment, and depth suggested that the lexicality conditions differed in source surface area and depth, but not in source current density. This lexicality effect is compatible with a modular rather than an interactive view of the relationship between lexical and phonetic representation.

Abstract = {The present study with tasks involving different kinds of words was designed to examine the role of lexical- and rule-based strategies in the written spelling of 150 Grade 3 to Grade 6 students (9–12 yrs old). In 4 tasks, Ss were asked to spell irregular or exception words embedded in short sentence frames or decontextualized regular words or to write pseudowords with orthographic/phonologic neighbors. Correlational analysis and multiple regression analyses provided an estimate of the contribution of these strategies as sources of variation in spelling. Results suggest that the spelling of pseudowords and the spelling of regular words require many rulelike processes, whereas the spelling of exception words involves slightly different processes. Some evidence exists for the preference of the rule strategy over the lexical strategy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Data was elicited from 74 children ranging in age from 2.5 to 10.5 yrs. The experimental protocol involved using an agent question 'x tham arai?' ('What is x doing?') and a patient question 'Kert arai kin kap y?' ('What happened to y?') to elicit a response through a play session. The results indicate that children acquiring Thai overgeneralize syntactically and semantically. The syntactic overgeneralization involves using non-alternating verbs as alternating verbs and vice versa. The semantic overgeneralization involves a violation of the selectional restrictions. Moreover, the data provide evidence for the emergence of the periphrastic constructions and the use of the constructions against the use of the lexical causatives.

Abstract = {This chapter reports on the authors' current research developing computational forms for the interlingua-based machine translation (MT) of spatial expressions. Given a spatial expression, or its computational semantic form, how is the expression's spatial semantics to be allocated lexically, that is, among the expression's entries in the lexicon? In interlingua-based MT research, lexical allocation is the problem of allocating or subdividing a linguistic expression's full interlingual (IL) structure into the substructures that are lexical IL forms and an IL lexicon for translating English spatial expressions into Turkish. We describe different ways in which spatial information is allocated to lexical IL forms in our MT system, preruntime during lexicon construction and at runtime during lexical selection.

Abstract = {Described and evaluated the written and spoken communication of a 29 year-old dysphasic woman (AF) in light of current theories of production. AF presented with superior ability in written over spoken sentences. In contrast, her comprehension showed the reverse trend. Cognitive neuropsychological investigations revealed that her double dissociation was more apparent than real. AF's superior auditory comprehension was attributed to suspected dyslexic factors impeding written comprehension. However, an account of a strong dissociation between her written and spoken production was less obvious. The evidence suggested AF suffered from a procedural mapping deficit which had a disproportionate effect on spoken production. AF's performance challenges current models of lexical access which consider syntactic knowledge to be amodal. An alternative account is considered within A. Caramazza's (1997) Independent Network model of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Cerebral asymmetries in lexical ambiguity resolution were studied. In 2 experiments, targets related to the dominant and subordinate meanings of ambiguous word primes were presented for lexical decision after a 750-ms stimulus onset asynchrony. Experiment 1 compared presentation of target words to the left visual field/right-hemisphere (LVF/RH), to the right visual field/left-hemisphere (RVF/LH), or after redundant bilateral visual field (BVF) presentation. Experiment 2 examined unilateral priming in the absence of a BVF condition. On unilateral trials, priming was observed for dominant meanings in both the LVF/RH and RVF/LH, whereas subordinate priming was obtained only in the RVF/LH. These results suggest a possible role of hemispheric interaction in the availability of ambiguous word meanings. BVF performance evidenced a bilateral redundancy gain and priming that resembled that obtained on RVF/LH trials. Additional BVF analyses were not consistent with a strict race model interpretation and appear to implicate hemispheric cooperation in the bihemispheric processing of lexical information.

Abstract = {A new task, double-word selection, simulated lexical ambiguity by presenting 2 words between which the reader had to choose while reading a sentence shown at 133 or 150 ms/word, following a procedure called rapid serial visual presentation. The double-word pair was presented for less than 100 ms. In immediate recall of the sentence, readers made a correct selection on most trials, both when the relevant context came before the double words and (less accurately) when the relevant context came shortly afterward (Experiments 1 and 2) or with a delay of up to 1 s (Experiment 3). Both words could often be reported if the sentence was stopped one word after the double words (Experiment 2). In Experiment 4, a single function word determined selection between double words differing in syntactic category. The results are consistent with a 2-stage modular interactive model of word perception (M. C. Potter, A. Moryadas, I. Abrams, & A. Noel, 1993) and extend this model to word selection and lexical disambiguation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Most cases of category-specific naming and recognition disorders are characterized by poorer performance with living entities, usually animals. Patients with the less frequently observed opposite pattern of impairment, i.e. better performance with biological entities than with nonliving things, provide evidence for a double dissociation, making a strong case for the categorical organization of the semantic system. The authors describe a 27-yr-old male patient with a category-specific naming impairment for tools. The S was evaluated after the evacuation of a hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe. Naming was severely impaired, without significant modality, frequency, word length or grammatical class effects. A significantly inferior performance was present for nonliving items (furniture and tools). The S's performance on tests assessing comprehension of the same items suggested that semantic knowledge about artefacts he could not name was largely preserved. The localization of the lesion confirms the important role of the left anterior temporal lobe in lexical retrieval. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {16 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (pAD) were exposed to a new verb in a naturalistic fashion. Their knowledge of the word's semantic and grammatical characteristics was probed for several minutes following this exposure, and compared with their performance on parallel measures assessing known words. Significant differences were seen between pAD patients and controls in the acquisition of the new verb's semantic meaning and its argument structure, but pAD patients did not differ from controls in the acquisition of the new word's grammatical form class. Individual patient analyses demonstrated parallel deficits restricted to the semantic meaning and argument structure of the new word and known words in several pAD patients, suggesting that a selective language impairment contributed to their word learning deficit. This pattern is consistent with an intimate relationship between semantic meaning and argument structure in semantic memory. Other pAD patients had difficulty learning about all aspects of the new word, despite good performance with known words, suggesting that compromised memory may have limited their lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {Reviews recent research on the effects of orthographic neighbors on visual word recognition in order to resolve apparently contradictory findings. The review reveals that the empirical evidence is not as contradictory as has been claimed. Neighbors have consistently been reported to facilitate responses to words in naming and lexical decision tasks. Inhibitory effects of neighbors appear to arise from sophisticated guessing strategies in the perceptual identification task or lexical decision strategies adopted in unusual stimulus environments. For English words, there is minimal evidence of competitive influences on lexical retrieval due to higher frequency neighbors. Such effects are more common in such languages as French and Spanish, perhaps because they embody a more consistent relationship between orthography and phonology. These findings provide important constraints on assumptions about the form of lexical representations and the parallel activation mechanisms assumed to underlie lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {Italian speakers who signaled that they were in a tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) state were asked to recognize the grammatical gender and the initial and the final phonemes of the unavailable word. The proportions of gender and phoneme hits that occurred with 'don't know' (DK) responses were adopted as baselines for chance-level performance. Participants were more accurate in recognizing the grammatical gender and the initial but not the final phoneme of target words when they were in TOT than in DK states. The availability of gender in TOT states suggests the independence of syntactic from phonological information in lexical access. However, the retrieval of gender was far from perfect for TOT words, and it was no better than recognition of the initial phoneme. These results are problematic for the notion that the selection of a lemma is synonymous with the retrieval of the word's syntactic features. The implications of these results for the distinction between lemma and lexeme levels of representation in lexical access are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Three experiments conducted to investigate aspects of the word-nonword version of the Reicher task were motivated, in part, by the recent series of experiments by Prinzmetal (1992). He found a word-superiority effect (WSE) with unlimited exposure durations, in contrast to the typical Reicher-task method involving limited exposures, raising the issue of whether lexical access is involved in the WSE with brief exposures. An interactive-activation account (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1982) might suggest that the feedback from lexical access that would boost the perceptibility of the letters in a word would be more helpful with brief, masked stimulus exposures, with lexical access playing a negligible role with unlimited exposures. Positive evidence for lexical access with brief exposures was found with lexical priming (Experiment 1 ), homophone spelling (Experiment 2), and pseudohomophone repetition (Experiment 3). The converging evidence also revealed the applicability of the Reicher-task method to a variety of issues central to lexical access and word perception.

Abstract = {In describing the phonotactics (patterning of phonemes) of English syllables, linguists have focused on absolute restrictions concerning which phonemes may occupy which slots of the syllable. To determine whether probabilistic patterns also exist, 2 experiments were conducted to analyze the distributions of phonemes in a reasonably comprehensive list of uninflected English CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words, some 2001 words in all. The results showed that there is a significant connection between the vowel and the following consonant (coda), with certain vowel-coda combinations being more frequent than expected by chance. In contrast, we did not find significant associations between the initial consonant (onset) and the vowel. These findings support the idea that English CVC syllables are composed of an onset and a vowel-coda rime. Implications for lexical processing are discussed.

Exp 1, with 7 native speakers (aged 19–30 yrs) of Mandarin Chinese was designed to provide acoustic information about speaker F0 ranges and Mandarin tones 2 and 3. The experiment consisted of 3 reading tasks, the results of which established the mean and overall F0 range of the speakers. Exp 2, with 6 native speakers (aged 19–40 yrs) of Mandarin determined how the acoustic dimensions of timing of the turning point and ΔF0 contribute to perception of Mandarin tones 2 and 3. Exps 3–5, with a total of 33 native Mandarin speakers, tested the hypothesis that listeners perceive tones in part by normalizing for speaker F0 range. Exps 3–5 employed a design which compared how identical stimuli were identified when presented in 2 contexts differing in F0 range. To ensure that the effect was caused by normalization of different talker characteristics, the test used naturally spoken carrier phrases from different speakers as precursors. Results suggest that perception of tones is a talker-contingent process. Results also show that listeners use extrinsic F0 information in perception of lexical tones.

Abstract = {A computational model of oral reading developed by D. C. Plaut et al (1996) proposes that reading aloud low-frequency exception words (e.g., yacht) relies upon a reading pathway that maps semantic representations directly onto output phonology. One prediction of this model is that, if the semantic reading pathway is damaged following brain damage, a pattern of surface dyslexic reading will be observed, characterized by frequent regularization errors when reading aloud low-frequency exception words (e.g., shoe→'show'). The authors report the oral reading of a semantic anomic patient (a 50-yr-old male) who makes frequent semantic intrusion errors on confrontation naming tasks as well as semantic errors on word–picture and picture–picture matching tasks. Contrary to the prediction of the Plaut et al (1996) model, the patient's oral reading of exception words, including his oral reading of picture names that are exception words, is intact. An important additional feature of this patient's language profile is that his oral reading of non-words is poor, suggesting that there is impairment to a phonological reading pathway. It is argued that preserved oral reading in this patient reflects the operation of a lexical, non-semantic reading pathway. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Explored the representation of inflectional morphology in the English lexicon. Inflected forms may be derived from an uninflected base form by rule application; by contrast, both regular and irregular inflection may be treated in the same way, with morphological patterns emerging from mappings between base and inflected forms. A series of experiments with a total of 124 university students investigated these issues using a lexical decision task. Exp 1 showed that response latencies to nouns were significantly shorter than those to verbs. A possible explanation for these results can be found in differences in inflectional structure between English nouns and verbs. Namely, the relative frequency of uninflected compared with inflected forms is greater for nouns than for verbs. Exps 2 and 3 compared noun stimuli with different inflectional structures. In all cases, differences in response latencies were predicted by the frequency of the surface form, whether uninflected or inflected. The pattern of results lends support for a unitary associative system for processing regular inflection of nouns in English and argues against the view that regular inflected plurals are derived by rule from a single, uninflected lexical entry.

Abstract = {Examines the literature on subcortical aphasia and proposes several hypotheses regarding the role of the thalamus and basal ganglia in cortical function. The authors contend that aphasia due to nonthalamic subcortical lesions results from a combination of thalamic disconnection and transient or permanent cortical dysfunction related to persistent ischemia or infarction that is not evident on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. They also suggest that the basal ganglia have very little to do with language function. Furthermore, the authors note that aphasia in patients with dominant thalamic lesions is usually related to destruction of the frontal lobe–inferior thalamic peduncle–nucleus reticularis–center median system, which may produce linguistic dysfunction. The result is a failure to properly define working memory in the temporal and parietal cortex that serves as the substrate for the lexical–semantic field.

Abstract = {Two experiments using the picture-word interference paradigm were used to investigate the nature of the representations (phonological/orthographic) underlying lexical access, both in picture naming and in picture writing, and their activation time course. Three alternative views of lexical access in naming and in writing were tested. According to the first view, phonological and orthographic codes are activated in parallel both in writing and in naming. According to the second view, phonological codes are only activated in naming and orthographic codes are only activated in writing. Finally, the third view states that phonological codes are activated in naming and mediate writing. Undergraduate students who were native speakers of French participated in the experiments. The findings did not support one of three tested views on lexical access in naming and in writing. However, they clearly ruled out a strict phonological mediation view of lexical access in writing.

Abstract = {Older adults (aged 60–80 yrs) performed 3 lexical information-processing tasks approximately 1.3 times slower than young adults (aged 18–22 yrs). Slopes of regressions based on individual Ss' reaction times (RTs) on single lexical decision (SLD) and category judgment (CJ) tasks did not differ from slopes based on a double lexical decision (DLD) task. Moreover, slopes based on the SLD and CJ tasks accurately predicted the size of semantic priming effects on the DLD. This was true for the older group as a whole, and also for subgroups of fast, medium and slow older adults, as well as for young adult subgroups. The size of the semantic priming effects for the fast old and slow young subgroups were approximately equal, consistent with the idea that the effect of age on priming is entirely attributable to slowing. Across all tasks, each old subgroup showed the same degree of slowing relative to the corresponding young subgroup, so that the differences in RTs observed between subgroups in the young sample were magnified in the old sample. The findings suggest that ability-related differences in lexical processing speed may be functionally equivalent to age-related differences and that both factors interact to determine performance on speeded lexical tasks.

Abstract = {Examined mothers' provisions of object names during naturalistic play with their infants and investigated the effects of characteristics of mothers' speech on children's development of lexical principles or constraints. Play interactions were observed with 20 infants at ages 10 mo, 1 yr 1 mo, 1 yr 5 mo, and 1 yr 9 mo. Mothers facilitated their children's determination of reference and differentially adjusted their naming practices to novel, comprehended, and familiar animals. They virtually always named the whole object first. The 1st mention of novel animals involved both maternal naming and physical designation of the object 92% or more of the time. Thus, although a novel word's referent may be indeterminate logically, mothers specify it practically. Results support the position that maternal labelling practices may assist children in acquiring lexical principles and that lexical acquisition can proceed during natural conversational interactions before infants master lexical principles.

The deaf children all had a severe or profound hearing loss and were receiving special education in either a school or a unit for the deaf. The experimental tasks used a lexical decision task involving the reading of single words. The employment of phonology in reading was investigated by comparing reading performance on regular and irregular words and by comparing reading of homophonic vs non-homophonic nonwords. Both tasks revealed that hearing Ss were much more affected by regularity and homophony, suggesting a much greater reliance on assembled phonological recoding.

Abstract = {Previous research on spoken word recognition has demonstrated that identification of a phonetic segment is affected by the lexical status of the item in which the segment occurs. W. F. Ganong (1980) demonstrated that a category boundary shift occurs when the voiced end of 1 voice-onset time continuum is a word but the voiceless end of another series is a word; this is known as the 'lexical effect.' A series of studies was undertaken to examine how lexical neighborhood, in contrast to lexical status, might influence word perception. Pairs of nonword series were created in which the voiced end of 1 series had a higher frequency-weighted neighborhood density, whereas the reverse was true for the other series. Lexical neighborhood was found to affect word recognition in much the same way as lexical status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Exp 1 examined the effect of number of letters on latency for naming high-frequency words, low-frequency words, and nonwords. Number of letters affected latency for low-frequency words and nonwords but not for high-frequency words. Number of letters was also negatively correlated with number of orthographic neighbors, number of friends, and average grapheme frequency. Number of letters continued to affect nonword naming latency, but not low-frequency word naming latency, after the effects of orthographic neighborhood size, number of friends, and average grapheme frequency had been accounted for. Exp 2 found that number of letters had no effect on the latency of delayed naming of the same words and nonwords.

In Exp 1, relatedness (high or low), NOMs (many or few), and nonword condition (legal nonwords or pseudohomophones) were manipulated in lexical decision. Three groups of college students participated in Exp 1: 100 Ss participated in the estimation of NOMs, 19 Ss participated in the estimation of relatedness, and 81 Ss participated in the lexical decision experiment. Another 40 college students participated in Exp 2. Results for Exp 1 show that in the pseudohomophone condition, relatedness and NOMs both produced significant main effects, and an interaction. Words with few, unrelated meanings produced the slowest response times (RTs), all other words produced statistically equivalent RTs. Results of the pseudohomophone condition of Exp 1 were replicated in Exp 2, except the main effect of NOMs was not significant. The overall unreliability of NOMs effects lead the authors to question the contribution of NOMs to the observed interaction. NOMs metrics are often confounded with relatedness; words with many meanings tend to have highly related meanings. Results show that relatedness among meanings can influence lexical decision performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The receptive lexical proficiency of 392 Dual Language primary school children in Gibraltar (aged 4–12 yrs), was compared with English monoglot norms based on a currently used test of receptive vocabulary (i.e., the British Picture Vocabulary Scales (BPVS), which was standardized on monoglot English speaking children in Great Britain). The Ss' lexical proficiency was measured in their 1st language (Gibraltarian Yanito Spanish) and in their 2nd language (English). Their receptive conceptual vocabulary was also calculated. Their lexical proficiency in each of these linguistic variables was then compared with the published BPVS 'norms.' The results indicate that only a small number of children's lexical proficiency in Spanish and in English was within the BPVS 'normal' limits. However, when their conceptual vocabulary was compared to the BPVS norms, a larger number of children fell within the 'normal' limits (i.e., standard score of 85 or more). It is concluded that the practice of assessing the lexical proficiency of Dual Language (Gibraltarian) school children by the use of tests standardized for monoglots is invalid and unreliable, even when their conceptual vocabulary is used as the measure of their receptive lexical proficiency.

In Exp 2, 108 Ss took 3 restoration/adaptation tests to examine predictions that nonwords with high lexical overlap should behave similarly to real words. Using 24 Ss, Exp 3 tested whether the lexical status of intact adaptors directly influences adaptation. Real English words (containing either a /b/ or a /d/) produced reliable adaptation shifts in labeling of the /bI/ and /dI/ syllables, as did words in which the /b/ or /d/ was perceptually restored (when noise replaced the /b/ or /d/).

Abstract = {The dual mechanism hypothesis argues that the apparent contrast in English inflectional morphology, between a rule-based default procedure generating regular past-tense forms and listed irregular forms stored in an associative net, reflects universal constraints on the properties of possible morphological systems. This study investigated whether these constraints can be shown to hold, in the ways predicted by the dual mechanism hypothesis, for Italian past-tense inflection. Exp 1 (with 24 native Italian-speaking university students), using a cross-modal repetition priming task, showed that priming generated by regular inflected pairs does not differ from priming by irregular inflected pairs. Exp 2 (with 20 native speakers of Italian), using an elicitation task where Ss produce past-tense forms for novel verbs, not only showed little evidence for the presence of an underlying default but also demonstrated that phonological similarity can affect both regularized and irregularized elicitation patterns. These results contrast with previous research in English that used the same techniques, and suggest that claims about universal morphological patterns need to be extended to include procedures that combine both high productivity and lexical specificity.

Abstract = {Two patients with dominant thalamic infarction, one in the tuberothalamic artery territory, the other in the paramedian artery territory, demonstrated language impairment limited to word retrieval difficulties in spontaneous language and structured naming tasks. Using a cognitive neuropsychological model of lexical processing developed in the study of patients with cortical lesions, we carried out a detailed investigation of their lexical abilities. Both patients demonstrated impairment restricted to oral and written picture naming and oral naming to definition, and spared performance on tasks of lexical comprehension, oral word reading, and writing to dictation, as well as syntactic comprehension and production. Naming impairment disproportionately affected lower frequency words, and word substitutions often corresponded to objects that were semantically-related to target words. We propose that our patients' word retrieval impairments reflect a failure of thalamic input to effectively engage the cortical networks subserving lexical semantic processing, leading to degraded levels of activation as the semantic system interfaces with subsequent stages of lexical processing.

Abstract = {This chapter serves as a bridge between the traditional anatomic approaches and more contemporary cognitive analyses of naming disorders. These are disorders that are more closely tied anatomically to input–output systems than are dissociations of semantic categories. Specifically, De Bleser confronts the controversy as to whether semantic knowledge is multiply represented in various sensory systems through which objects may be experienced (e.g., visual, auditory, and tactile representations), or whether object concepts are stored in an abstract, supramodal representation.  The author favors the 2nd possibility, claiming that most disorders of object naming appear in the same form regardless of the channel of sensory stimulation.  The appearance of purely optic aphasia, acoustic aphasia, or tactile aphasia appears to support the existence of multiple modality-specific semantic stores. The author clarifies the relationship between such semantic knowledge and the general lexical-semantic representation of concepts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studied implementational choices in pronunciation by analogy (PbA) for English to assess its ultimate suitability - both as a model of the human process of reading aloud, and as a component of a text-to-speech (TTS) system. The variables studied were the specific lexical database used as the basis of the analogy process, the way of ranking/scoring candidate pronunciations, and the effect of manual vs automatic alignment of letters and phonemes. When tested with short (monosyllabic) pseudowords, the lowest error rate achieved was 14.3%. This suggests that the current PbA systems are at best poor models of pseudoword pronunciation by humans. When tested with lexical words temporarily removed from the dictionary, the best performance obtained was 93.5% phonemes correct for a 16,280-word dictionary. This was superior to the 25.7% words correct obtained using a set of popular letter-to-sound rules, indicating considerable scope for analogy methods to be exploited in future TTS systems.

Immediate naming tasks were used in Exp 1 in which human subjects were 40 male and female Korean university students with normal eyesight or corrected eyesight participated. Subjects with normal or corrected vision were asked to input their reactions as the experimenter read loudly, accurately, and as fast as possible from the text presented on the computer screen. 191 words were selected to reflect as widely as possible the word frequency, number of letters, number of phonemes, and number of syllables. The text stayed on the screen until the students input their reactions. Delayed naming tasks were used in Exp 2 in which 27 university students participated. The words were presented for 1,500ms and the subjects waited to react until they saw the word 'begin' on the screen. The results indicate that word length has an effect on lexical access.

S's performance on picture naming tasks that require 2 consecutive responses was used to explore the relations between the phonological and orthographic components of the lexical system. Tasks requiring responses in different modalities (i.e., 1 oral and 1 written) often resulted in lexically inconsistent responses. By contrast, inconsistent responses never occurred in tasks that required 2 consecutive responses in the same modality (i.e., oral or written). These results rule out the hypothesis that phonological mediation is necessary for writing and suggest that orthographic word forms are autonomous from phonological forms, and that they are activated directly from lexical semantic information.

Abstract = {Discusses the Dutch verbs doen ('do') and laten ('let') which categorize an event as involving either direct or indirect causation, respectively. The difference between these verbs reflects the folk world view in which the mental world is seen as separate from the physical, each having distinct causal properties. The authors show how this explains the sharp difference in the preferences of both verbs for animate and inanimate participants. Another cultural cognitive model playing a role in the use of doen vs. laten is the folk model of the mind, which governs our understanding of mental processes such as perception and belief. Against the background of this model, speakers exploit the choice between the two verbs for particular effects. This study demonstrates the intimate relation between cognitive models, pragmatic contextual factors, and lexical semantics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the time course of the bias in predictive inferencing as a function of anxiety (AX). Ambiguous (AB) sentences (concerned with ego-threat, physical-threat, or nonthreat events) were presented, followed by disambiguating sentences in which a target word either confirmed or disconfirmed the consequences implied by the AB context. 16 high- and 16 low-AX Ss read the sentences at their own pace with the moving-window procedure. Effects on word reading times at different points were measured. Priming effects occurred for high-AX Ss when reading disambiguating ego-threat-related sentences. There was greater relative facilitation for confirming than for disconfirming ego-threat versions in high-AX Ss, compared with physical-threat and nonthreat versions, and with low-AX Ss. The authors conclude that the bias towards ego-threat predictive inferences does not occur during the initial processing of the AB information, but rather is a post-lexical delayed phenomenon.

Abstract = {Discusses the influence of lexical knowledge on sublexical processes of word recognition. The authors focus on the perceptual 'migration' of linguistic units between 2 stimuli presented simultaneously, resulting in an illusory percept. Ss were college students. Results showed that, in dichotic listening, the migration of the vowel, leading to erroneous detection of the prespecified target, occurred less often with real word targets than with nonsense word targets. However, when the 2 items of the pairs were played in both ears at different amplitudes so that they were perceived to be closer to each other than in the dichotic situation, the lexical effect only remained when the mispronounced phoneme was in an unstressed syllable. The mispronunciation of stressed syllables of words may impair lexical access in such a way that no lexical influence on early processing stages is possible. In contrast, the mispronunciation of unstressed syllables does not affect lexical access, thus allowing the lexical influence to take place. These results are problematic for temporally sequential models of lexical access. Rather, they support models that include the stress patterns of words as an important aspect of both lexical access and the interaction between sublexical and lexical knowledge.

The second goal of our study was the comparison of the effect of these variables in normal and poor Spanish readers. 140 children (aged 7–12 yrs), 20 of whom were poor readers, were tested using a reading test of 306 items in which we balanced all the variables. The dependent variable was the percentage of correct responses in a decontextualized word reading test. Results showed that all the above mentioned variables produced a significant effect on the number of errors made by the children, suggesting no difference between the processes involved in the reading acquisition of Spanish and those implicated in deep orthographies such as English. The 4 variables studied showed the same behaviour in their effect on reading performance for both normal and poor readers, indicating that poor readers also use both the lexical and the phonological route.

Following bihemispheric embolic infarcts, the S presented with severe fluent aphasia, characterized by fluent strings of phonemes, with virtually no intelligible utterances. Despite nearly total jargonized output, the fundamental phonological processes of speech were largely intact. Specifically she demonstrated: (1) English phonotactics and English stress-timed rhythmic principles, (2) aspirated stops word-initially and glottalized stops word-finally, (3) utterance-final declination of pitch, and (4) stressed syllable vowel lengthening. Additionally, regional-specific (Southern American English) phonological processes, including monophthongization, in-gliding, and front vowel backing, were also preserved. Overall, the investigation reveals an example of an intact phonological rule system operating on a grossly disturbed input (lexical representation).

In Exp 2, 40 Ss were required to spot real CVC or CVCC words (C = consonant, V = vowel) embedded in bisyllabic nonsense strings. For CVCC words, fewer errors were made when the second syllable of the nonsense string was weak rather than strong, whereas for CVC words the effect was reversed. Exp 3 ruled out an acoustic explanation for this effect. Results are in line with an account in which both metrical segmentation and lexical competition play a role.

Results showed that the length of word flankers systematically affected line bisection, supporting the 1st hypothesis. In conflict with the remaining hypotheses, however, word bisection was biased toward their beginnings for horizontal words but not for vertical words. A similar bias with pronounceable nonwords (but not with meaningless letter strings) and an increase of the word bisection bias in nonnative readers suggest that overestimation of the spatial extent of word beginnings is related to lexical access.

The paradigm used single-language auditory texts with visual target words under normal, visually degraded, speeded, and delayed naming conditions. Cross-language priming was always observed when the target language was predictable (in the blocked condition), even under speeded conditions. When the target language was unpredictable (in the mixed condition), cross-language priming was observed only when response was delayed (delayed naming) and under a subset of conditions when word recognition was delayed (visual degradation). Results are compatible with the idea that cross-language priming in a sentence context is more likely to involve the use of expectations, strategic processes, or both that allow bilinguals to tune themselves to external conditions. There are enough exceptions to the general rule, however, to warrant a reconsideration of the lexical-postlexical dichotomy. Implications for modular versus interactive models of lexical access are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Semantic errors produced by normal and aphasic speakers on a picture naming test were examined for their phonological similarity to the targets they replaced. In both groups of subjects, semantic errors preserved phonological characteristics of the target word at rates greater than would be expected by chance. These results are consistent with previous findings in speech error corpora (e.g., G. Dell & S. Reich, 1981) and error elicitation studies (P.A. Martin et al, 1989) and lend support to the assumption that semantic and phonological representations of a word are retrieved in two overlapping stages. In addition to extending this finding to the aphasic population, the use of a picture naming task in the present study eliminated some of the potential confounds that arise in connected speech. In a second study, we examined phonological relationships within sets of semantically related words and showed that there is no tendency for these words to share phonological characteristics. This finding substantiates the argument that the tendency for semantic errors to preserve phonological characteristics of the target word does not arise by chance. We discuss these results in relation to alternative models of lexical retrieval. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Patients with acquired deep dyslexia are unable to read nonwords aloud. The deficit has therefore been attributed to damage in nonlexical phonological processing. L. Buchanan et al (1994) demonstrated that a deep dyslexic patient could process nonword phonology in 2 implicit tests. The generality of this claim is examined by replicating the Buchanan et al experiments with 2 deep dyslexic female patients (64 and 67 yrs old). Dissociations between lexical and nonlexical processing are examined by manipulating nonword phonology in a task that does not require lexical analysis. The results suggest that sensitivity to nonword phonology in deep dyslexia is common and is distinct from a purely lexical analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A critical issue in modeling speech perception is whether lexical representations can affect lower level (e.g., phonemic) processing. Phonemic restoration studies have provided support for such top-down effects, but there have also been a number of failures to find them. A methodology is introduced that provides good approximations to the underlying distributions of perceived intactness that are assumed in signal detection analyses of restoration. This methodology provides a sensitive means to determine the necessary conditions for lexical feedback to occur. When these conditions are created, a reliable lexical influence on phonemic perception results. The experiments thus show that lexical activation does influence lower level processing, and that these influences are fragile. The theoretical implications of real but fragile lexical effects are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new naming test and a set of detailed procedures that have been developed for selecting and coding responses. This is part of a larger collaborative study that seeks to explain normal and aphasic error patterns in terms of an interactive, spreading activation model of word retrieval. It is widely believed that error types seen in normal and aphasic naming are reflective of the stages of word retrieval. Semantic errors arise at the first stage, which involves retrieval of an abstract semantic-syntactic representation known as the lexical entry, or lemma. Phonemic paraphasias arise during later retrieval or assembly of the phonological form. Other errors appear to reflect the interaction of information across these two stages. One is the so-called mixed error: a substituted word that bears both semantic and phonological resemblance to the targe. Another is the formal paraphasia (malapropism; phonic verbal paraphasia): a word that bears a purely phonological resemblance to the target. On interactive, two-stage models, formal paraphasias reflect the influence of Stage 2 phonological information on Stage 1 lexical retrieval.

Abstract = {Demonstrated that the representations of orthographic output lexicon are passed along to the graphemic buffer in morphemic units in a 45-yr old male with brain injury. Sentence completion, written picture naming and spelling items tasks were presented to the S. There was a selective preservation of suffix spelling in the context of the phonologically plausible spelling of word stems. The preservation of suffix spelling was observed consistently despite the fact that spelling for the suffix corresponded to more than 1 phonological form. Error patterns reveal that stem material was processed via phonology–orthography conversion, while suffix material was processed lexically. It is concluded that the morphologically complex forms may be represented in a compositional manner in a lexical orthographic system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The authors explored whether consonant harmony, a common rule-governed process of feature copying, operates as a compensatory device for completing phonological representations in fluent aphasia. Data indicate that harmony constrained the feature substitution errors involving the feature class of voice, but not place of articulation; substitutions due to an error in manner were rare. Findings suggest that for English-speaking fluent aphasics, a consonant harmony rule for the feature voice is incorporated into a compensatory output mechanism that is used to complete faulty lexical-phonological representations.

Segui (1989) reported that higher frequency neighbors inhibit lexical access (the 'neighborhood frequency effect'). Because neighborhood size and neighborhood frequency typically covary (words with large neighborhoods will usually possess higher frequency neighbors), these findings would seem to contradict one another. In the present study, 6 experiments on the effects of neighborhood size and neighborhood frequency indicated that, at least for low-frequency words, large neighborhoods do facilitate processing. However, the existence of higher frequency neighbors seems to facilitate rather than inhibit processing. The implications of these findings for serial and parallel models of lexical access are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Limitation and lexical development of infants (n = 20) were examined longitudinally at ages 10, 13, 17, and 21 mo. Infant lexicons were determined from maternal interviews. Words, vocalizations, and actions either outside or within infants' current repertoires were presented at ages 10 and 13 mo. More verbally advanced 13-mo-olds imitated more words inside their repertoires, but only reproduction of words outside their current lexicons predicted their future lexical development. When early vocabularies were statistically controlled, Ss who imitated more words outside their repertoires at 13 mo acquired larger noun lexicons by 17 mo and larger non-noun lexicons by 21 mo. Imitation of other behaviors was not related to vocabularies. Infants' early imitation of words not in their repertoires predicts and may facilitate their future lexical development.

Abstract = {Reports the performance of a 64-yr-old female who, as a consequence of left frontal and temporoparietal strokes, makes far more errors on nouns than on verbs in spoken output tasks, but makes far more errors on verbs than on nouns in written input tasks. This double dissociation within a single S with respect to grammatical category confirms that phonological and orthographic representations of nouns and verbs are processed by independent neural mechanisms. Furthermore, the opposite dissociation in the verbal output modality, an advantage for nouns over verbs in spoken tasks, by a different S using the same stimuli has also been reported. This double dissociation across Ss on the same task indicates that results cannot be ascribed to greater difficulty with one type of stimulus and provides further evidence that grammatical category information is an important organizational principle of lexical knowledge in the brain.

The children received object-manipulation tasks every 3 mo and were assessed by the Communicative Development Inventory. Parental labelling practices were assessed monthly using a picture-book reading task. Both parental labelling and children's categorization skills predicted the content of children's lexicon, with children with more names in their vocabulary having better categorization skills. The naming explosion coincided with improvement of categorization skills. Findings suggest that the influence of each factor varies as a function of the stage and aspect of lexical development considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Each target word was paired with 6 prime types. Six experimental versions were constructed, with materials rotating across versions such that each target occurred only once in each version. Six Ss were assigned to each version. Ss listened to spoken sentences and gave lexical decision responses to visually presented targets.

Abstract = {The authors examined the interaction of acoustic and lexical information in lexical access and segmentation. The cross-modal lexical priming technique was used to determine which word meanings listeners access at the offsets of oronyms (e.g., tulips or two lips) presented in connected speech. In Experiment 1, participants showed priming by the meaning of tulips when presented with two lips. In Experiment 2, priming by the meaning of the 2nd word was found in such sequences (e.g., lips in two lips). Finally, Experiment 3 demonstrated that listeners do not show priming by lips when it is pronounced as part of tulips. The results of these experiments show that listeners sometimes access words other than those intended by speakers and may simultaneously access words associated with several parses of ambiguous sequences. Furthermore, the results suggest that acoustic marking of word onsets places constraints on the success of lexical access. To account for these results, the authors propose a new model of lexical access and segmentation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Both real referent and anomalous trials (RRTs and ATs) were included, as well as nonverbal control trials. During the RRTs, all Ss preferred the matching puppet. During the ATs, Ss showed no preference with 2 of the labels (dog and cat); however, they did show a preference when cow was requested but not available. There were no differences based on prior overextension performance in production. It is concluded that overextensions in production are not diagnostic of children's underlying semantic representations, and that ATs in comprehension provide useful information concerning young children's lexical entries.

It is believed that when older adults' response times (RTs) and semantic priming effects (SPEs) are regressed on young adults' RTs and SPEs, the slopes of the regression lines are approximately 1.5 as long as the age difference is held constant and performance is reasonably accurate. Both increases and decreases in RTs following unrelated and related primes, relative to RTs following baseline primes, were analyzed. Results support the hypothesis that, compared with young adults who are 50 yrs younger, older adults take approximately 50% longer to process lexical information.

Abstract = {Three studies were designed to test in undergraduates the hypothesis that longer picture-naming than word-reading times were due to differences in the time to access articulatory codes. In Exp 1, 48 Ss were presented with stimuli in lists blocked by input modality (picture or word) to test the hypothesis that pictures are more likely than words to activate the entire name. In Exp 2, 36 Ss underwent the same procedure but the responses were delayed. In Exp 3, pairs of target and comparison items were shown sequentially to 48 Ss who were asked to judge if they were the same as the previous targets. Latencies to articulate entire names were faster than that for the 1st letter of the referent both for pictures and words; however, the difference was significantly larger for pictures. Pictures are more likely than words to activate a holistic lexical representation of their referents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Identification experiments (with 90 university students) on words and short CV segments excised from conversational speech show that local phonetic variables, notably sentence accent and the phonetic and S properties of individual segments, exert a greater influence on intelligibility than whether or not the word has been used before in the conversation. These phonetic influences were stronger in the segment identification task than in the word identification task, consistent with the fact that word recognition made use of a wider range of phonetic, lexical, and contextual information than that relevant to isolated segments. Results are interpreted in a framework for speech perception and word recognition in which lexical items are represented in terms of phonetic features with associated probability levels. The probability levels are affected both by the analysis of the sensory input and by lexical and contextual information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Three experiments and a simulation study investigate competing featural and phonemic views of the representation of the speech input in access to the mental lexicon. Auditory lexical decision and gating tasks show that the processing consequences of subcategorical mismatches (conflicts between phonetic cues to speech segment identity) depend on the lexical status of the conflicting cues, such that conflicts that only involve nonwords do not disrupt performance. A further study, using a phonetic-decision task with the same stimuli, found the same pattern. A simulation study shows that the interactive activation model TRACE, with top-down feedback to a prelexical phonemic level, does not model these effects successfully. The authors argue instead for a direct access featural model, based on a distributed computational substrate, where featural information is mapped directly onto lexical representations.

Writing evaluation showed better results in using lower-case, rather than upper-case letters.

Utterance boundaries were identified using the following criteria: A sequence of words was considered to constitute an utterance if it contained a verb or the arguments of a verb, and the verb could be inferred based on its argument structure. Evidence is presented that words are first constrained to uses in specific discourse contexts, and later used more flexibly and with greater control over the semantics of the terms. Derivation of meaning from discourse is described as a dialectical process, and as such it is claimed to be more consistent with the full range of observational data, than other current theories of lexical acquisition in early childhood.

Two types of calculations, neighborhood-based and word-based, were used to determine neighborhood sizes. Over 80% of the words in the early lexicons had at least 1 near phonological neighbor. 18% had 6 or more phonological neighbors, and 39% had 4 or more neighbors. Results suggest that a significant percentage of children's phonological representations must contain a considerable amount of information, from the earliest stages of lexical development.

As subsequently encoded orthographic information becomes available, activation is withdrawn from lexical entries with which it is inconsistent, and the cohort is resolved when only a single candidate remains. The model is intended to characterize the initial encoding of the graphic information, the recoding of that information into an abstract orthographic form, the manner in which the appropriate lexical entries are then activated, the process whereby subsequent orthographic encoding resolves those activated entries to a single candidate, and the way in which Ss use information for making decisions as it emerges during this processing.

Analyses indicated that while both sociolinguistic factors and structural features of languages have influenced NA lexical accumulation, the former have had substantially greater influence. It is noted that NA languages primarily influenced by Spanish have strongly tended to adopt Spanish loanwords for items of acculturation, but languages primarily influenced by English or French have strongly tended to label introduced terms through use of native vocabulary. It is proposed that degree of past bilingualism may have been a significant sociolinguistic factor influencing the degree of lexical borrowing.

Abstract = {Investigates whether processing compound words presents the speaker with problems different from processing single nouns and aims to elucidate how the speaker's knowledge of compound words is related to the knowledge governing the compounding process. A picture naming task requiring the correct naming of forty-nine compounds as compared to monomorphemic nouns was given to a group of fifteen German speaking aphasics. The analysis of errors in response to compound targets yielded the following characteristics: semantic paraphasias and phonologically well-formed neologisms tended to reflect the compound structure of the target in a large percentage (73% of 124 verbal paraphasias). Compound paraphasias and neologisms often (48% of 91 compound verbal paraphasias) contained one component of the target. Nearly all errors respected German word building rules. These results suggest that aphasics retain knowledge about the compound status of a word and are able to use compounding rules, although they are unable to retrieve the correct lexical word form. Information of the morphological (compound) form seems therefore to be accessed separately from the lexical word form. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This thesis describes an extensive norming study of Spanish verbs and an online language processing study investigating whether bilingual lexical processing is nonselective (both languages are activated) when only one language is required for use. To study bilingual lexical processing, researchers have relied upon words of shared orthography and semantics between languages in order to determine how word form and meaning impact bilingual word recognition. However, because these words have been of exact form overlap through cognates (words sharing form and meaning between languages: banana in Spanish and English) and homographs (words sharing form yet differing in meaning: the English adjective  red meaning net in Spanish), it has been difficult to distinguish which language(s) participants engage during processing tasks. The present research addresses this issue by investigating cognate and homographic  verbs between languages. Because differences in verb morphology between Spanish and English never result in exact form overlap between languages (e.g.,  assist and asistir), interlingual cognate and homographic verbs between Spanish and English should ensure that participants operate in one specific language. Hence, utilizing verbs provides an original testing ground to determine if the bilingual language processor is nonselective when operating in one language and to what degree the access depends on form and meaning overlap between languages. An extensive norming study of Spanish verbs produced a reliable list of cognates and homographs with English. The online research indicated that bilingual lexical access is guided not only by form and meaning, but also by how the frequency of a word's meanings from both languages attach to a single form. These results mirror recent discoveries in ambiguity research in monolinguals (e.g., Rodd, Gaskell and Marslen-Wilson, 2002), the implications of which suggest an overriding mechanism of language processing—not just a theory of bilingual lexical processing.

Abstract = {The [voice] distinction between homorganic stops and fricatives is made by a number of acoustic correlates including voicing, segment duration, and preceding vowel duration. The present work looks at [voice] from a number of multidimensional perspectives. This dissertation’s focus is a corpus study of the phonetic realization of [voice] in two English-learning infants aged 1;1–3;5. While preceding vowel duration has been studied before in infants, the other correlates of post-vocalic voicing investigated here — preceding F1, consonant duration, and closure voicing intensity — had not been measured before in infant speech. The study makes empirical contributions regarding the development of the production of [voice] in infants, not just from a surface-level perspective but also with implications for the phonetics-phonology interface in the adult and developing linguistic systems. Additionally, several methodological contributions will be made in the use of large sized corpora and data modeling techniques. The study revealed that even in infants, F1 at the midpoint of a vowel preceding a voiced consonant was lower by roughly 50 Hz compared to a vowel before a voiceless consonant, which is in line with the effect found in adults. But while the effect has been considered most likely to be a physiological and nonlinguistic phenomenon in adults, it actually appeared to be correlated in the wrong direction with other aspects of [voice] here, casting doubt on a physiological explanation. Some of the consonant pairs had statistically significant differences in duration and closure voicing. Additionally, a preceding vowel duration difference was found and as well a preliminary indication of a developmental trend that suggests the preceding vowel duration difference is being learned. The phonetics of adult speech is also considered. Results are presented from a dialectal corpus study of North American English and a lab speech experiment which clarifies the relationship between preceding vowel duration and flapping and the relationship between [voice] and F1 in preceding vowels. Fluent adult speech is also described and machine learning algorithms are applied to learning the [voice] distinction using multidimensional acoustic input plus some lexical knowledge.

Abstract = {Five experiments were conducted to investigate how phonological information is processed in Cantonese spoken word production using the picture-word interference (PWI) paradigm. Participants were asked to name aloud individually presented pictures and ignore an accompanying auditory word distractor. In the first three experiments of the present study, the target picture names were Cantonese mono-syllables with a consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) structure. Participants' picture naming latencies were found faster when the target (e.g., /sing1/l¹, 'Star') and the distractor (e.g., /ging 2/, /sik6/, or /soeng3/) shared two identical segments (irrespective of the segments' syllable-internal position), than when they were unrelated, whereas no reliable effects were obtained when they shared only the vowel (e.g., /dim3/), the coda (e.g., /hu ng2/), or together with the tone (e.g., /bit1/ or /fung1/). Furthermore, the facilitation effect observed in the consonant+consonant+tone-related condition (e.g., /soe ng1/) was found reliably larger than that in the consonant+consonant-related condition (e.g., /soeng3/). In Experiment 4, the syllable structure of the targets was manipulated such that half of the picture names were mono-syllables with a consonant-vowel (CV) structure (e.g., / so1/, 'comb') and the other half a CVC structure (/sing1/). A significant syllable (without tone) related facilitation was found irrespective of the target type, whereas no reliable effect was observed when the target and the distractor (e.g., /se6/ and /sam2/, for CV and CVC targets, respectively) shared only the onset consonant. Furthermore, Experiment 5 investigated whether phonetic factors modulate the facilitation effect observed in a PWI task. To this end, the sonority level and duration of the target's rhyme component were manipulated in Experiments 5A and 5B, respectively. A significant rhyme-related priming effect was found in both Experiments 5A and 5B, and such effect was neither affected by the sonority level nor duration of the target's rhyme component. These results are in line with the notions that (1) a single segment does not have a significant impact on Chinese spoken word planning, (2) sub-syllabic constitutes such as rhyme is an important processing unit, (3) the lexical tone has a unique role to play during phonological encoding, and (4) segmental and tonal retrieval are operated in an interactive manner. Based on all the available results from Cantonese PWI research, an interactive model of Cantonese spoken word production is proposed. ¹The transcriptions for Cantonese syllables presented in this paper are based on the Cantonese Romanization Scheme proposed by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong (Chinese Character Database: With Word-formations, 2003). The number besides each syllable marking denotes the lexical tone. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The current research addresses questions about the kinds of words that appear in the early vocabularies of bilingual children. Gentner (1982) claimed that in early vocabulary development children are more likely to learn words that label people and things than to learn words that label actions and attributes or words that have grammatical functions. This hypothesis of a universal preference for nouns over other words (i.e., a 'noun bias') has been challenged in this decade, with studies of children acquiring Asian languages such as Korean and Mandarin Chinese (Choi & Gopnik, 1995; Tardif, Gelman, & Xu, 1999) suggesting that their preference for nouns may be considerably weaker than that observed in studies of certain European languages. However, methodological limitations and gaps in the empirical literature have prevented a strong test of hypotheses concerning the existence and magnitude of a universal (or language-general) noun bias. This dissertation was designed to provide strong evidence on the question of whether the noun bias in early lexical development is language-general or language-specific, by comparing the percentages of nouns produced by bilingual children acquiring English and Mandarin. Participants were 50 bilingual children at age 22-30 months, whose vocabulary size in each language fell between 50-300 words. The major finding is that the percentage of Mandarin nouns was significantly lower than the percentage of English nouns, with a mean difference of 16%. Additional analyses showed that the distribution of English nouns differed significantly from the distribution of Mandarin nouns across eight semantic categories. Nouns predominated the 50 most frequently produced words in both languages, but the list of the most frequent 50 words in English included substantially more nouns than did the most frequent words in Mandarin, consistent with the main finding of a lower level of noun bias in Mandarin. Finally, a similar degree of noun bias was observed after excluding translational equivalent words in children's lexicons. Results from a within-child bilingual design suggest that both universal cognitive constraints and language input shape the types of words that appear in early lexical development.

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of working memory capacity, access to subordinate meanings of L1 homonyms and degree of cross-language activation on the access to subordinate meanings of L2 homonyms. In Experiment 1, Spanish-English bilinguals completed a word recognition task which assessed how quickly and accurately they accessed subordinate meanings of English homonyms that were either noncognates (e.g. fast/ rápido) or cognates (e.g. letter/letra) with Spanish. In Experiment 2, another group of Spanish-English bilinguals read sentences while having their eye-movements recorded for measures of lexical access. On the critical trials, sentences contained a homonym that was either a noncognate (e.g. fast/rápido) or cognate with Spanish (e.g. letter/letra). The context preceding the target word (i.e. homonym) was either biased to the subordinate meaning or neutral. General analyses from Experiments 1 and 2 showed that access to subordinate meanings of cognate homonyms was facilitated compared to access to subordinate meanings of noncognate homonyms. Analyses of the individual differences factors revealed that access to subordinate meanings of L1 homonyms was the most consistent predictor of access to subordinate meanings of L2 homonyms. These findings are discussed in terms of how these individual differences should be taken into account to better model the dynamics of bilingual lexical disambiguation.

Abstract = {Four reading-time studies in the dissertation investigated the online representation of a syntactic ambiguity and the nature of the time course of the interaction between syntactic and non-syntactic constraints. The target syntactic ambiguity was the construction of Verb NPI de NP2 in Chinese, which is ambiguous between a relative clause (RC) and a complement clause (CC) analysis. Using an eye-tracking paradigm, Experiments 1 and 2 explored whether the parser can maintain multiple alternative structures of an ambiguity and how semantic plausibility influences the early stage of syntactic processing. The results demonstrated that the degree of processing difficulty at the disambiguation varied as a function of the relative support for the RC and the CC alternatives from the syntactic and the semantic constraints. The findings can be best accounted for by a limited, ranked parallel parsing model, such as the surprisal theory (Hale, 2001), which maintains that processing difficulty is incurred by resource reallocation during disambiguation. Experiment 3 and 4 utilized syntactic priming to investigate how recent prior experience with a particular structure can influence syntactic ambiguity resolution in comprehension. Experiment 3 showed that lexically independent priming in comprehension facilitated the accessibility of the repeated RC structure, increasing the difficulty of structural revision to the unprimed CC alternative. Experiment 4 found that prior experience with the English RC structure affected the processing of the corresponding structure in Chinese, even though the RC structures differ in word order in the two languages. The observed syntactic priming in comprehension between Chinese and English RC structures suggested that the two languages have a shared syntactic representation that does not specify word order. Overall, the dissertation contributes to the understanding of structural representation and information integration during syntactic ambiguity resolution. The findings provided evidence for an interactive and limited parallel approach to sentence processing. Moreover, lexically independent comprehension priming suggested that prior experience with a particular syntactic configuration can function as a constraint at the structural level. Thus, a traditional constraint-based lexicalist theory (e.g. MacDonald, Pearlmutter, & Seidenberg, 1994) must incorporate non-lexical representations in order to make use of statistical regularities beyond the lexical level.

Abstract = {In spoken word recognition, high-frequency words with few neighbors and less frequently occurring minimal pair neighbors (lexically easy words) are recognized more accurately than low-frequency words with many and more frequently occurring neighbors (lexically hard words). Bradlow and Pisoni (1999) found a larger easy hard word effect for non-native than native speakers of English. The present study extends this work by specifically comparing word recognition by non-native listeners with either earlier or later ages of immersion in an English-speaking environment to that of native English speakers. Listeners heard six lists of 24 words, each composed of 12 lexically easy and 12 lexically hard words in an open-set word identification task. Word lists were presented in quiet and in moderate noise. A substantially larger easy-hard word effect was obtained only for the later learners, but a measure of oral vocabulary size was significantly correlated with performance for the non-native listener groups only. Thus, the increased easy-hard word effect for non-native listeners appears to be explained as an effect of phonetic proficiency and/or vocabulary size on the structure of the lexical neighborhoods.

In addition, lexical priming was examined by presenting an identity prime earlier in the text. Results show that nonthematic words were regressed to more often than thematic words. Regressions were typically initiated after reaching a clause or sentence boundary. Regressions were thus assumed to be made to integrate nonthematic words into the previous context. Modest negative correlations were found between a word's fixation time and its relative predictability. No effects of lexical priming were observed.

Abstract = {In 3 cross-modal priming experiments, the authors investigated whether access to a word's meaning is affected by the semantic context in which it is heard or is exhaustive and context-independent. The access of nonassociated semantic properties and normatively associated words before and after prime offset was probed. Whereas associated targets were primed context-independently, access to semantic property targets was affected by the sentential context. Semantic property targets showed greater priming in a sentence biasing to a specific semantic property than in a neutral condition, even when this bias made the target property irrelevant rather than relevant. These results cannot be accounted for by current exhaustive access or context-dependency theories of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {32 hungry and 32 satiated undergraduates were compared on word recognition for words of 3 types of content (food, positively emotional, or negatively emotional) to assess whether expanding the size of the parafoveal image would yield patterns of word processing similar to those obtained under foveal viewing. Words of 17-mm size were created to take cortical magnification into account. Word duration was 8 msec in Exp 1 and 5 msec in Exp 2. Exp 1 yielded overall high levels of performance, and Exp 2 yielded overall low levels of performance; yet the usual foveal patterns of word recognition failed to be evident, especially with respect to motivation. In Exp 2, highly frequent words were significantly more easily recognized than were infrequent words, but the usual facilitation of hunger (as opposed to satiation) was absent for both experiments. Foveal and parafoveal viewing may lead to distinct forms of lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Events were represented by complex toys. In the FEC, dyads interacted with the same event-toy during each observation period. In the UEC, these same dyads interacted with a different novel toy during each observation period. Results indicate that children's increasing event knowledge facilitated their language development. Specifically, children's lexical type use, action verb use, and mean length of utterance increased in the FEC but remained unchanged in the UEC.

Abstract = {High- and low-anxiety students read texts word by word with the moving-window technique under test conditions. Multiple regression analyses on word-reading times were computed with a number of psycholinguistic variables serving as predictors. Anxiety did not impair comprehension, but increased word-reading times, which were affected interactively by anxiety and specific psycholinguistic variables (end of clause, serial position within the text, narrativity, and summary). Data reveal that anxious readers need to employ a greater amount of processing resources than their non-anxious counterparts to obtain a similar comprehension level. Anxiety is selectively detrimental to the efficiency of text-level processes, such as those involved in integrating information across sentences, but does not impair low-level processes, such as encoding and lexical access.

Silent intervals between members of the triplets varied between 100, 500, and 1,250 msec. For both groups of aphasics overall priming effects were obtained at silent intervals of 100 and 500 msec. Results suggest that both types of aphasics can automatically access the semantic lexicon, but might be impaired in integrating lexical–semantic information into the context. In Exp 2, Ss were asked to judge the semantic relations between a subset of the primes that were used in the lexical decision study. Wernicke's aphasics performed worse than both Broca's aphasics and 12 normal controls (aged 46–72 yrs), thus indicating a specific impairment for Wernicke's aphasics in consciously operating on automatically accessed lexical–semantic information.

Relative to spelling controls, the low-frequency towed and the high-frequency beach speeded up the naming of frog and tree, respectively, to the same degree.

In the reading studies, syntactic misanalysis effects in sentence complements (e.g., 'The student forgot the solution was…') occurred at the verb in the complement (e.g., was) for matrix verbs typically used with noun phrase complements but not for verbs typically used with sentence complements. In addition, a complementizer effect for sentence-complement-biased verbs was not due to syntactic misanalysis but was correlated with how strongly a particular verb prefers to be followed by the complementizer that. The results support models that make immediate use of lexically specific constraints, especially constraint-based models, but are problematic for lexical filtering models.

Abstract = {The lexical decision task was combined with sentence priming to examine the impact of hemispheric specialization and sentence length. Both the target stimuli and the sentence primes were in Hebrew and 26 male right-handed native Hebrew speakers served as Ss. Hebrew is written and read from right to left. Therefore, according to the favorable foveal viewing explanation (K. Kirsner and S. Schwartz; see record [rid]1987-23962-001[/rid]) there should have been no right visual field (RVF) superiority. Results indicate highly significant RVF superiority. Furthermore, priming sentences, written in Hebrew, should direct the attention of the subject to the left visual field in expectation of the appearance of a target word. Nevertheless, the RVF superiority was even more significant when target stimuli were preceded by priming sentences. Results indicate that reading habits and directed reading attention cannot explain RVF superiority in lexical decision. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments to investigate 2.5- to 3.5-yr-olds' knowledge of names for solid substances, their ability to learn names for solid substances, and their knowledge of nonlinguistic properties of solid substances. 32 Ss participated in each experiment. It was found that children of this age do not know many names for solid substances but can be taught names for them. There was evidence that Ss represented the names as mass nouns and possibly adjectives. Findings suggest that there is development of children's nonlinguistic knowledge of substances between the ages of 2.5 and 3 yrs. The relevance of these results for theories of lexical development is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {[The author] argues for [the centrality of the lexicon to language and language acquisition] and for the general principles of conventionality and contrast at the core of language acquisition. She looks at the hypotheses children draw on about possible word meanings, and how they map their meanings onto forms. She starts with children's emerging knowledge of conventional words and their meanings—the ontological categories they rely on for early meanings and their strategies for mapping meanings onto forms. She then takes up their growing knowledge of word structure as reflected in their formation of new words, and shows that children learning different languages follow similar paths as they learn about words and word-structure.  [This book] is unusual in dealing with data from a large variety of languages, in its emphasis on the general principles children rely on as they analyse complex word-forms (transparency of meaning, simplicity of form, and productivity), and in the broad perspective it takes on lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {Describes a learning theory (LT) that uses error detection based on positive-only evidence to explain how 1st-language learners acquire vocabulary items, particularly verbs, with speed and apparent ease. The formal properties of lexical representations are detailed, and learning is characterized with regard to the acquisition of designated morphological elements. The basic assumptions of the LT are discussed, including the prediction that argument-structure-changing morphology will cause errors that will be detected so that there is evidence for the learner. Varying lexicalization patterns and the difficulties they present for learning are discussed, and the manner in which learning prepositions and derivational affixes will constrain the course of lexical learning is described. The learning criterion is specified in terms of the point at which there are no further detectable lexical errors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

As a group, fluent aphasics produced less representative exemplars than did nonfluent aphasics. One third of the fluent aphasics produced category violations in 24% of their drawings. Their violations were always related to the target superordinate, paralleling their oral performance on a category naming task. Their drawings of category violations expressed perceptual attributes less accurately than did their drawings of target exemplars. Category-specific difficulties were extremely rare. The remaining fluent aphasics produced very few category violations and drew perceptually accurate pictures but did exhibit reduced naming fluency. Some fluent aphasics seem to be compromised at processing the information in semantic memory that underlies such concepts as fruit, whereas others seem to be impaired at lexical retrieval.

In the dual route cascaded (DRC) model of reading, they varied a parameter controlling the rate of inhibition from letter units to the orthographic lexicon to mimic strategic control over the extent of specific lexical processing. In this article, we provide an account in which the effects are simulated by varying the DRC's reading-aloud criterion--a parameter that sets the minimal level of phonemic activation required to pronounce a letter string. We show that varying this parameter provides another means of controlling lexical contributions to reading aloud. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {It has been frequently noted in the literature that content words need to consist of at least three letters; this observation is commonly dubbed 'three letter rule.' However, a survey of the CELEX database (Baayen et al. 1995) shows that there are (nearly) no content words in English and German that begin with two or more consonant letters and end in a single vowel letter. Words such as [bruː] are not spelt < bru > but < brew > with an additional letter. These findings cannot be accounted for by the three letter rule but they are explicable within a supra-segmental theory of graphematics that includes graphematic feet and graphematic weight: a well-formed graphematic word consists of at least one graphematic foot that in turn consists of at least one heavy graphematic syllable. This paper offers a data-based survey in order to answer the question whether there is a suprasegmental minimality constraint for monosyllabic graphematic words in English and German.

This article attempts to define what the body of a polysyllabic word might be, suggesting that it is the body of the 1st orthographically defined syllable of the word (the body of its basic orthographic syllable structure [BOSS], or BOB, e.g., the EAD of MEADOW). Three experiments, testing 60, 96, and 45 university students, respectively, demonstrated that the pronunciation of a nonword is influenced by the pronunciation of the BOB of a preceding word, but not by the pronunciation of its vowel alone or its 1st phonologically defined syllable. The results of the 3 studies are interpreted as supporting the idea that the BOB is an important unit of lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A series of four experiments was carried out to assess the ability of word formation with eighteen aphasic patients (six Anomic, seven Broca's, and five Wernicke's aphasics) and seven normal people. Experiment 1 required subjects to form two two-letter kanji words with four kanji characters presented. Experiments 2 and 3 were addressed to each of two linguistic processes of word formation, i.e., selection and order, respectively. The tasks of these two experiments were to select the correct one from two connected forms of kanji. Experiment 4 focused on subjects' ability to analyze a derivative or a compound. The results of these experiments indicated that aphasics' ability of word formation was impaired, with the Wernicke's patients being the most severe and the Anomic patients the least. The Broca's patients were situated between the two aphasia types. However, some common features were observed across the three types of aphasic patients. Moreover, it is suggested that in aphasic patients deficits lie in gaining access to lexical information, rather than in the lexical organization itself.

The frequency of these current maternal utterances was then correlated with measures of their infants' productive lexical development at 13 and 24 mo of age. In 19 dyads in which mothers had been employed outside of the home during their infants' 1st 2 yrs, the correlations between the maternal input measures and infant lexical development were significantly lower than those observed in 19 dyads in which the mothers were at home as full-time caregivers during this period of development.

Exp 2 yielded the same pattern even though lexical decisions preceded accessibility estimates by a full week. Exp 3 dismissed the possibility that the Exp 2 results may have been due to a long-term influence from the lexical decision task to the rare word judgment task. These results support a model in which Ss (1) retrieve topic familiarity information in making accessibility estimates in the rare word definition task and (2) use this information to modulate lexical decision performance.

Abstract = {Measured the effects of repetition on activation of the semantic traces as a way of deducing the general properties of how information is recovered from memory. On a prime-target lexical decision task for 120 undergraduates, 4 factors were manipulated. These factors were (1) relatedness between prime and target (semantically related or unrelated), (2) number of repetitions (1–5), (3) type of repeated stimulus (only the prime, only the target, or both), and (4) stimulus onset asynchrony (within a range of 40–400 msec). Repetition and semantic priming were additive rather than interactive. There was no automatic episodic priming (i.e., no interaction between related and unrelated conditions across repetitions), thus refuting predictions of a lexical model.

Abstract = {Presents the case reports of 3 patients (aged 28–40 yrs) with left splenial lesions who made paralexic errors restricted to the left end of words. Errors appeared more frequently when a correct response was dependent on the initial letter of the stimulus. One S had full visual fields with hemialexia affecting the left visual field. The other 2 Ss had complete right hemianopia. Left-sided reading errors in the hemianopic Ss are attributed to a retinotopically restricted disconnection pattern that selectively disrupts transfer of information originating from the peripheral left visual field. Callosal information transfer during normal reading may primarily involve elemental sensory rather than lexical/semantic information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the consequences of semantic congruity and repetition on the processing of words in sentences, using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and cued-recall performance measures in 2 experiments. 33 Ss (aged 18–34 yrs) participated. Sentences that ended either congruously or incongruously were repeated once (Exp 1) or twice (Exp 2) and followed by a recall test in which the sentence fragment served as a cue for the final word. Repetition benefited the recall of both congruous and incongruous endings and reduced the amplitude and shortened the duration of the N400 component of the ERP more for incongruous than congruous words. For incongruous sentence terminations, repetition increased the amplitude of a broad positive component subsequent to the N400. Results indicate that in addition to their singular effects, semantic congruity, repetition, and word frequency converge to influence a common stage of lexical processing.

These analyses compare picture naming with reading, picture categorizing, and word categorizing. Techniques of double stimulation, such as the paradigms of priming and of Stroop-like interference, are used. Results obtained with these methods are reviewed and discussed with regard to 5 hypotheses about cognitive structures involved in picture naming. Besides older hypotheses of internal coding systems with only verbal or only pictorial format, hypotheses of an internal dual code with a pictorial and a verbal component, of a common abstract code with logogen and pictogen subsystems, and the so-called lexical hypothesis are discussed.

Abstract = {Investigated qualitative differences in 38 poor readers (aged 9 yrs) relative to 40 normal-achieving readers (aged 7–8 yrs) of the same reading level. Ss were matched in phonemic processing and then given tests of memory span and visual discrimination of letter-like characters. The Ss were required to read different word types (regular, exception, and pseudoword) and were asked to complete a homophonic pseudoword test. The poor readers were worse at reading pseudowords compared with controls, but this difference was unrelated to phonemic length or number of letters, or to the ease of producing analogies for the pseudowords. Results suggest that although there were no differences with reading-age controls in phonological processing, poor readers had worse graphene–phoneme conversion skills and greater reluctance to relinquish the lexical route when appropriate.

However, a closer examination of these apparently semantically related verbs reveals that their syntactic properties diverge. An exploration of the patterns of behavior of the verbs suggests that the initial class includes 3 linguistically significant subclasses. The components of meaning that are relevant to characterizing each subclass are identified by isolating those components of meaning that the members of each subclass share. The conclusion considers the implication of the meaning components identified in this study for a lexical semantic representation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In a study investigating possible sources of processes in children's speech, J. Aitchison and S. Chiat (see record [rid]1982-27813-001[/rid]) suggested that many developmental phonological processes may be a result of problems in lexical storage and retrieval. However, they had no adult control group, whose results might have helped clarify their findings. The present research with 40 graduate and undergraduate students was similar to Aitchison and Chiat's investigation with children and was intended to provide additional information about whether children's typical phonological processes generally involve lexical storage and recall difficulties. Results suggest that one should not assume that children's spontaneous phonological processes are generally a result of lexical storage and recall factors.

Abstract = {Proposes a typology of errors in natural language dialog between man and machine. A discussion of possible correction strategies shows that the correction of user competence errors should take precedence over the correction of performance errors. The discussion also emphasizes that error prevention, although generally neglected, is a major way to avoid dialog dead-ends, and should be taken into account in natural-language interface design. It is proposed that if dialog systems cannot as yet be adapted to users, then they must be transparent and consistent enough so that users can adapt to them. To illustrate, an overview is given of various methods developed from these methodological principles for correcting and preventing errors at the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels.

Abstract = {Conducted 3 experiments with a total of 167 adults to investigate the kinds of information represented in the lexicon-internal network that the classical model of lexical context effects has long considered to be the unique source of automatic lexical priming (ALP). Results provide evidence against claims that ALP is a product of an informationally specific lexical-level network. Neither the type of relation used nor its predictive strength was found to have any significant influence on the size of the ALP effect. Automatic context effects may be better accounted for by a model that proposes a postaccess semantic integration process that operates in parallel with, but independently of, the mechanisms that bring off overt lexical recognition.

Abstract = {A comprehension-sensitive proofreading task was used to examine phonological recoding during the silent reading of natural text. In Exp 1, adult readers identified inconsistent words that were or were not homophones of consistent ones; phonology was implicated by the finding that readers were less likely to detect the inconsistent word in You vile villain to steel my goldp, than in You vile villian to stale my goldp, but only if exposed to an error-free version first. Exps 2 and 3 ruled out working memory and word-specific priming explanations, which suggests that the homophone effect reflected phonological codes activated during lexical access. Although homophony interfered with the initial detection of an inconsistent word, Exp 4 showed that it facilitated the recovery of the correct solution (e.g., steal). Homophone effects are interpreted within the frameword of a context-sensitive version of G. C. Van Orden's (see record [rid]1988-22282-001[/rid]) lexical access model.

Abstract = {Contrasts cross-linguistic predictions made by a grammar-derived parsing model with those of a top-down model whose functional motivation is nonlinguistic. This latter minimal attachment model significantly predicts difficulty with respect to the processing of languages such as Japanese, which display different surface properties than English. This problem is not encountered in a model that recognizes the crucial role of heads in licensing argument structure with respect to processing as well as grammar. Cross-linguistic parsing differences are attributed to the linear and structural positions of licensing heads, which constitute the primary locus of the cross-linguistic variation that is ultimately ascribed directly to the projection principle. This principle holds that each level of syntactic representation is a uniform projection of the lexical properties of heads. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Preceding the inflection with a brief exposure to the stem did not facilitate recognition of the whole word that followed, and the speed of recognizing an IW was more strongly associated with the frequency of the whole inflected form than with the frequency of the stem. These results suggest that in word recognition, lexical contact is first made with the whole word form. Morphological decomposition, however, may still occur in subsequent processing.

However, reading times later in the sentence were faster when the prepositional phrase was a syntactic argument rather than a syntactic adjunct of whatever word it modified, suggesting a final preference for arguments over adjuncts.

A cross-linguistic gating study was conducted to investigate whether 28 English-speaking and 60 native Bengali-speaking listeners would interpret nasal and oral vowels differently in the 2 languages. Results show that surface phonetic nasality in the vowel in vowel–nasal sequences was used by English listeners to anticipate the upcoming nasal consonant. In Bengali, however, nasality was initially interpreted as an underlying nasal vowel. Results support the hypothesis that the listener's interpretation of the speech input is in terms of an abstract underspecified representation of lexical form.

It was hypothesized that S's errors were due primarily to limited ability to retain information in the graphemic buffer, a structure that holds sequences of abstract letter identities for output. Consistent with this hypothesis, S's spelling accuracy declined on long words, but the number of letters he wrote per response was not related to word length. By having S write words forward and backward, it was shown that S's accuracy within a word depended on which part of the word he tried to output first.

The following points are raised for further consideration. First, the generality of Nayak and Gibb's results are called into question. Specifically, the range of stimulus materials used may have been too narrow for these results to be considered representative of most idiomatic expressions. This problem is demonstrated by showing that only a minority of idiomatic expressions possess clearly defined temporal aspects. Second, the need for a componential analysis of idiom interpretation is suggested and discussed. Third, Nayak and Gibb's description of the traditional theory of idiom interpretation is questioned. Finally, attention is called to the interpretation of the data from Nayak and Gibb's 6th experiment; it is suggested that the results may be due to lexical priming.

Abstract = {Presents computer models of lexical semantic change based on a circle of causation between frequency and accessibility, where changing accessibility produces changes in frequency and changing frequency produces changes in accessibility. Three models are described: single- and multi-word frequency accessibility models and a multi-word frequency-accessibility-expressivity model. The models demonstrate that language changes according to a regular pattern, which is woven by individual choices. The patterns that emerge do not have to be seen or intended by the persons choosing them, which is central to the understanding of lexical semantic change.

Abstract = {Part I of this volume, entitled 'Lexical Senses,' addresses the issue of terminology and jargon. Depending on the time, location, and mood, text writers will express their thoughts using different vocabularies. . . . Acquisition of the word-sense, as explained in Part I, can rely on a thesaurus, a dictionary, or a corpus of text.  Part II addresses the issue of lexical statistics. With the scaling up of text systems into open-ended text, performance can no longer attain the 100% mark. Accuracy must be traded off against breadth and robustness. . . . Statistical solutions for lexical-encoding problems are presented in part II.  Part III addresses lexical representation. On the one hand, at the level of each individual entry, what are the various attributes, i.e., syntax, meaning, argument structure, word-senses, and statistical properties, and how are they represented?  On the other hand, what is the organization of the entire lexicon? Clearly a flat list of terms, telephone-book style, will not be effective. Words must be indexed through their meanings; words must be interconnected by senses. How can complex organizations be maintained and acquired from text? Acquiring both local and global structures from on-line resources is discussed in Part III.  Part IV addresses the issue of lexical semantics.

Abstract = {Short-term memory (STM) for signs in native signers consistently shows a smaller capacity than STM for words in native speakers. Some researchers have argued that articulation time is sufficient to account for the sign-speech difference in STM. If articulation time does not fully account for the sign-speech difference in STM, then other differences between sign and speech may be important. In the article, the results of three experiments are reported. The first two verified that digits yield better STM than letters. In particular, because vision and audition have strikingly different information-processing characteristics, the sign-speech difference could be due to perceptually based coding. The third experiment returned to the original question: whether superiority of spoken language in STM persists when articulatory duration is controlled. It is concluded that STM for American Sign Language (ASL) and STM for English do not in fact differ in underlying capacity. Instead, the usually observed difference in span is due to other factors known to affect STM, most notably articulation time, which differs substantially between ASL and English for most lexical items.

Abstract = {Investigated lexical recognition in American Sign Language (ASL). Exp 1, with 8 Ss born to deaf parents (native signers) and 8 Ss born to hearing parents (late signers), examined identification of monomorphemic (MM) signs. Overall sign identification was faster than what has been found for spoken language. Exp 2, with 8 native signers and 8 late signers, compared the time course of recognition for MM and morphologically complex (MC) signs. MC signs had longer identification times than matched MM signs. Base forms of MC signs were identified initially by recognition of the morphological inflection. Native signers were able to isolate signs faster than late signers, suggesting that early language experience may influence the initial stages of lexical access and sign identification.

A clear deficit in phoneme awareness was found in both dyslexic groups. Performance on the 2 phoneme awareness tasks together uniquely accounted for substantial variance in nonword reading. The clinic but not the familial dyslexics appeared to have an additional deficit in verbal short-term memory. No clear deficits were found in either dyslexic group in phoneme perception, lexical retrieval, or articulatory speed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The 3 conditions were semantic-plus-morphological, pure morphological, and semantic priming. Ss were 96 undergraduates who were native speakers of Hebrew. The pure semantic relationship produced a significant facilitation at lag 0 that disappeared completely at lag 15. The pure morphological relation produced significant facilitation at lag 0 that was not attenuated at lag 15. When prime and target were related, the facilitation at lag 0 was similiar to semantic priming, whereas at lag 15 it was similiar to the pure morphological effect. Morphological repetition probably facilitates the retrieval of lexical information necessary for lexical decisions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {176 native Chinese speakers used native and nonnative (NON) languages to read and translate Chinese words and to name pictures. In Exp 1, Ss from Grades 2, 4, 6, and college with various degrees of proficiency in their 2nd language participated. In Exps 2 and 3, college students learned words in a new language, using Chinese words or pictures as media; then they performed reading, naming, and translation tasks. All Ss performed better in reading words than in naming pictures when responding in Chinese. When response was in the NON language, high-learning Ss were equally efficient in translation and picture-naming; low-learning Ss performed better in translation or picture-naming, depending on learning strategies. Proficiency in an NON language and the strategy for acquiring the language may be main determinants for the pattern of lexical processing in that language.

Abstract = {Studied the effect of object presentation on naming in 56 Ss (mean age 75.1 yrs) with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), 52 Ss (mean age 78.2 yrs) with moderate AD, and 60 normal controls (mean age 72 yrs) who failed to name the picture. The performance of the 2 groups of AD Ss was compared on confrontation naming (CFN) and auditory comprehension. There was progressive deterioration in CFN of pictures with increases in dementia severity, and progressive deterioration in the naming of objects presented after picture stimuli failed. A modest facilitation effect in CFN was seen when objects, as opposed to pictures, were presented, though the effect diminished with increased dementia severity. Clinicians should be cautious in concluding that a failure on CFN indicates a loss of conceptual or lexical knowledge in AD patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the transition from slow to rapid word learning in 18 children followed from the age of 1 yr 2 mo to 1 yr 10 mo. A chronological record of nouns and other word classes was coded from diary records of Ss' utterances recorded by mothers. 13 Ss evidenced a prolonged period of up to 3 mo during which rate of acquisition markedly increased. Almost three-quarters of the words learned during this period were nouns. Five Ss evidenced more gradual word learning and acquired a balance of nouns and other word classes. The terms 'vocabulary spurt' and 'naming explosion' seem to best describe children who focus early linguistic efforts on learning names for things. Other children may attempt to encode a range of experience with a more varied lexicon, which results in more gradual lexical growth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Recent theories of phonology hold that phonotactic well-formedness may be gradient, with some legal structures being more well-formed than others. Linguistic and psycholinguistic research has demonstrated that within morphemes, speakers encode both categorical (n/Onset) and gradient (st/Onset > sin/Onset) phonotactic restrictions. This dissertation investigated whether heteromorphemic sequences can be gradiently well-formed. In the first investigation, the effect of consonant similarity (the OCP) was investigated in tautomorphemic and heteromorphemic environments using an oral reading task. Subjects were slower to begin producing monomorphemic words containing similar/identical consonants (e.g., k ick, cog) than words containing dissimilar consonants. Similar gradient effects were found heteromorphemically (e.g., dimm ed) for four different suffixes (-ed, -s, -ing, -ness) and an effect was found in compounds where subjects were slower to begin uttering compounds that have a geminate (e.g., pe n name) than compounds that do not. This indicates that not all heteromorphemic sequences equally easy to produce. The second investigation extends this result to focus specifically on the phonological grammar. In this investigation, the speech errors of a brain-damaged individual, WRG, are reported. WRG suffers from a lexical impairment that leaves grammatical processing intact. Despite the lexical locus of the damage, his errors are distinctly grammatical in nature, repairing phonologically dispreferred sequences through epenthesis. WRG's errors thus provide a 'window' onto the functioning of an intact phonological grammar and provide an opportunity to investigate whether the grammar encodes gradient heteromorphemic constraints. WRG was asked to produce multimorphemic words containing legal heteromorphemic sequences of varying well-formedness (stress clash: brisknèss, aloofnèss vs. no stress clash: clévernèss ; obstruent-obstruent coda clusters: walked vs. sonorant-obstruent clusters: banned). WRG made insertion errors that improved the well-formedness (e.g., brisk idnèss; walk.tid) and made significantly more of these repairs on words containing the dispreferred structures. Crucially, these errors are shown to not be articulatory in nature, indicating that the errors arose at a phonological, pre-articulatory stage of processing. These results indicate that heteromorphemic sequences are subject to gradient phonotactic constraints in the phonological grammar. The 'Activation-Conditioned Faithfulness Hypothesis', relating lexical activation to grammatical processing is proposed to account for how grammatical errors can result from a lexical impairment.

Abstract = {While research into the role of semantic structure in the recognition of written and spoken words has grown, it has not looked specifically at the role of conversational context on the recognition of isolated words. This study was a corpus-based and behavioral exploration of a new semantic variable – sociality – and used on-line behavioral testing to obtain new word recognition data using the visual and auditory lexical decision tasks. The results consistently demonstrated that sociality is one of the most robust predictors of lexical decision performance. Overall, it appears that the visual lexical decision task is quite sensitive to the likelihood of words being used in conversations about people, and there is evidence suggesting this effect is multimodal and may extend beyond lexical decision.

Abstract = {Our study is focused on cross-linguistic influences in Spanish L3 acquisition by learners with English L1 and French L2. We based our observations in a corpus of written compositions from which we extracted the errors and classified them according to the possible influence from French and English that might have caused them. In addition, we did an error analysis database with the lexical, morphological and structural features that these errors exhibited, which we crosstabulated with information obtained in a linguistic profile that our participants responded. This mixed approach of the analysis of this written corpus combined with inferential statistics of the qualitative descriptions of error analysis data and the linguistic profiles information has allowed us to support the argument that L3 acquisition is not an identical process to L2 acquisition (Hall, 2001; Leung, 2005). The study also provides quantitative evidence to confirm the notion that the principles of recency, typological-lexical similarity, and proficiency are activated in Spanish L3 learners (Cenoz, 2001; Dewaele, 1998; Hammarberg, 2001). In addition, we have shown that the social and academic contexts of the L3 learners are related factors to the production of CLIs in the written performance of Spanish L3 individuals. Our study incorporates the interpretation of the mental representation of the language mode of trilinguals as proposed by Grosjean (2001; 2004), applied to third language learners. We offer an extended perspective for the application of the model in which the activation of previously acquired languages is independent of external factors such as the perceived linguistic background of the receptor of the message, as originally proposed by Grosjean. In sum, our holistic approach integrates qualitative and quantitative elements of the error analysis and participant profile data. We discuss how this approach can shed light on the dynamics that lie behind the production of crosslinguistic influences in the written production of third language learners. Keywords.

Matras' paper (see record [rid]2001-00303-001[/rid]) arguing that the compartmentalization of structures observed in mixed languages (i.e. the fact that certain structural categories are derived from one 'parent' language, others from another) is the result of the cumulative effect of different contact mechanisms. Given the need to separate code-mixing as a stylistic device from fusion/mixed languages (albeit on a continuum), it is asked whether all the examples of 'mixed languages' in Matras' paper satisfy the requirements of structural sedimentation. It is argued that the critical question is whether convergence and fusion can be separated at all, or if one should not rather refer to only one mechanism of ('fusional') language contact for which the first stages can be located in Matras' domains 1 and 4. It is concluded that this seems all the more plausible since it seems to be difficult to find instances of pure convergence; all examples discussed by Matras involve at least fusion in addition to convergence, sometimes also lexical re-orientation.

Abstract = {Comments on an article by G. F. Marcus et al (see record [rid]1999-00199-002[/rid]). In their experiment, the infants showed a preference for the inconsistent items, thus demonstrating transfer between the different syllable vocabularies used in habituation and testing. Because there was no phonological overlap between training items and test items, the authors concluded that a statistical learning device could not account for these transfer results without implementing algebraic-like rules. However, we suggest that statistical knowledge acquired in the service of learning to segment fluent speech into words might provide the basis for these transfer effects in much the same way as knowledge acquired in the process of learning to read can be used to perform experimental tasks such as lexical decision.

Abstract = {Syntactic priming occurs when processing one grammatical structure is facilitated by a previously encountered structure (Bock, 1986; Pickering & Branigan, 1998). These effects have been widely observed in production, and have recently been observed in comprehension (Pickering & Traxler, 2004; Arai, van Gompel, & Scheepers, 2007; and others). Syntactic priming may reflect residual activation for the prime sentence syntactic structure (Pickering & Branigan, 1998), implicit learning of the studied sentence structure (Bock & Griffin, 2000), or both. Experiment 1 investigated which mechanism(s) produce syntactic priming effects in comprehension. Participants took part in five eye tracking sessions that each contained 24 reduced-relative prime-target pairs with the same initial participle (RR-Prime: The client wanted by the advertiser was worth a lot of money; RR-Target: The actress wanted by the director was hesitant to confirm). Total fixation times on the prime sentences decreased across sessions at the critical regions, suggesting participants implicitly learned the structure. However, total time data revealed additional priming effects at the critical regions of the target sentences, and the magnitude of this effect did not change over the five sessions. This finding suggests that residual activation for the structure (that is stored with the repeated verb) also produces syntactic priming effects. These results are best explained by a dual mechanism account (residual activation and implicit learning) of syntactic priming effects. Experiment 2 investigated the time course of the previously observed syntactic priming effects. If residual activation for the prime sentence structure that is stored with the initial verb is quick to decay, then priming is unlikely to occur when there are multiple intervening sentences between the primes and targets. In Experiment 2 (a & b), zero, one, or three intervening sentences appeared between reduced-relative primes and targets with the same initial verbs. Significant priming effects were observed in the total time measure at the critical by-phrase region of the target sentences for all three conditions. The magnitude of this effect did not vary across conditions, which may suggest that the residual activation mechanism does not decay across intervening sentences that have different lexical items and syntactic structures.

Abstract = {One of the main challenges in the study of cognition is how to connect brain activity to cognitive processes. In the domain of language, this requires coordination between two different lines of research: theoretical models of linguistic knowledge and language processing on the one side and brain sciences on the other. The work reported in this dissertation attempts to link these two lines of research by focusing on one particular aspect of linguistic processing, namely lexical access. The rationale for this focus is that access to the lexicon is a mandatory step in any theory of linguistic computation, and therefore findings about lexical access procedures have consequences for language processing models in general. Moreover, in the domain of brain electrophysiology, past research on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) - electrophysiological responses taken to reflect processing of certain specific kinds of stimuli or specific cognitive processes - has uncovered different ERPs that have been connected to linguistic stimuli and processes. One particular ERP, peaking at around 400 ms post-stimulus onset (N400) has been linked to lexico-semantic processing, but its precise functional interpretation remains controversial: The N400 has been proposed to reflect lexical access procedures as well as higher order semantic/pragmatic processing. In a series of three MEG experiments, we show that access to the lexicon from print occurs much earlier than previously thought, at around 200 ms, but more research is needed before the same conclusion can be reached about lexical access based on auditory or sign language input. The cognitive activity indexed by the N400 and its MEG analogue is argued to constitute predictive processing that integrates information from linguistic and non-linguistic sources at a later, post-lexical stage.

Abstract = {Purpose. Young children with Down syndrome (DS) usually have special difficulty acquiring expressive vocabulary and grammar, and recent studies have indicated that at least from early school ages, their speech production skills also are weaker than can be predicted by their intelligence scores. During the babbling stages, however, children with DS have often been found to produce canonical syllables roughly within a typical timeframe. The first purpose of this dissertation is to determine whether early phonological development in children with DS can best be characterized as delayed but predictable based on mental age, as is the case for early comprehension of vocabulary and syntax, or whether, like vocabulary and grammatical production, speech production is more severely impaired than could be anticipated by the children’s cognitive abilities alone. The second purpose of this dissertation is to examine the extent to which early vocabulary delays are associated with deficits in speech sound production. Method. Measures of consonant inventory and syllable structure level were taken at two points from 50 of the children studied by Warren et al. (2008). Canonical and noncanonical words and utterances, and the initial- and final-consonant inventory were coded during two15-minute videotaped semi-structured conversational samples with a parent at two points in time, 18 months apart. Results. For all measures at Time 1 (age ∼25 months), the children with DS performed equally well or better than their peers without DS (NDS). The reverse was true for all measures at Time 2 (∼43 months). Consonant inventory size at Time 1 predicted lexical growth at Time 2 only for the children with DS. For the NDS group of children, 60% of whom began the study with fewer than 2 productive consonants, only Time 1 cognitive scores predicted later lexical growth. Conclusion. A clear relationship between slow phonological growth and slow lexical growth at the period of 'first word' acquisition was established for children with DS. The results of this study indicate that the phonological skills in young children with DS are delayed beyond the level predictable by mental age at the period of early lexical development.

This author believes that L2 learners have knowledge that they use to solve problems that are not different from the problems native speakers face. He describes the model of Unification Space (T. Vosse and G. Kempen, 1991) which seems to offer a process-based solution for the mechanism of feature matching that is central in Pienemann's theory.

Recognition and interference of a nontarget language (Russian) during production in a target language (English) were tested in Russian-English bilinguals using eye movements and picture naming. In Experiment 1, Russian words drew more eye movements and delayed English naming to a greater extent than control nonwords and English translation equivalents. In Experiment 2, Russian words spelled using English-specific letters drew more eye movements than control nonwords and English translation equivalents; however, both Russian words and nonword controls delayed English naming. Results of the two experiments suggest that nontarget-language information is processed during a target-language task. Recognition and production in bilinguals might function within distinct constraints, with recognition sensitive to lexical information (target and nontarget) and production sensitive to phonological information (lexical and nonlexical).

Abstract = {This thesis investigated mechanisms underlying impairments in naming, word repetition and nonword repetition in four different populations: patients recovering from post-stroke aphasia who received treatment (PSA), a control group of patients who did not receive treatment (CPSA), and patients with two variants of progressive aphasia (i.e., fluent FPA and nonfluent NPA). Predictions based on the interactive activation (IA) model of lexical retrieval (Foygel & Dell, 2000; Hanley, Dell, Kay & Baron, 2004) were tested at two time points in order to evaluate the viability of the model and its two mechanisms, the strength of semantic and phonological connections. The status of the putative non-lexical route in nonword repetition and its relationship to the model's other two mechanisms was also examined. Results of the naming study showed that, on average, patients in the PSA and CPSA groups presented with a combination of semantic and phonological impairments, while patients in the NPA and FPA groups presented with more uniform impairments to the semantic connections. Data from the word repetition study pointed to impairments mostly to the phonological connections in all groups. This combination of mechanisms appeared in the presence of what was usually impairment to the non-lexical route in the PSA and CPSA groups and a relatively spared non-lexical route in the NPA and FPA groups. The mechanisms underlying impairments were relatively stable over time but stability of lexical diagnosis was not seen across the tasks of naming and word repetition. Results also revealed that the non-lexical route, claimed by the model's proponents to be independent from the model's two other mechanisms, appeared in fact, to have a relationship with the phonological connections of the network. Participants with impaired phonological connections tended to have the non-lexical route impaired while those with impaired semantic connections (i.e., spared phonological connections) presented with a relatively spared non-lexical route. Findings from the three studies are discussed in the framework of the model's viability and its shortcomings. Limitations of this study are also discussed. Potential clinical and theoretical implications are presented along with directions for future research on lexical retrieval models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {For English speakers learning Arabic as a foreign language (L2), lexical acquisition is a major challenge. It is argued that to facilitate L2 Arabic lexical acquisition, teachers should explicitly teach learners to use the root and patterns word formation system unique to Arabic and other Semitic languages. This should raise learners' morphological awareness, which should in turn facilitate word acquisition. However, this claim has not been subjected to empirical research. The central research question of this study is: Does morphological awareness of the main word formation process of root and patterns in L2 Arabic facilitate learners' ability to infer meanings of unknown words, coin new words, and retain words? Two controlled classroom experiments were conducted that included a total of 109 beginning learners of Arabic enrolled in first- and second-semester Arabic classes at a US university. The experimental groups received explicit instruction and training on roots and patterns while the control groups did not. An immediate and a delayed post-test consisting of three sections were administered following a word learning session. The participants' retention of the learned words was measured in section A; their guessing of unfamiliar words whose roots are the same as the learned words was measured in section B; and their guessing of unfamiliar pseudo words was measured in section C. In each section, half of the items were tested receptively and the other half productively. The results show that the experimental groups significantly out-performed the control groups in the inferring and coining of unfamiliar items; however, there was no significant difference between the two groups in their word retention. These findings demonstrate the value of utilizing the root and patterns system when dealing with unfamiliar words. The data strongly demonstrate that beginning learners are able to effectively utilize the complex derivational morphology of Arabic in their lexical inferring and coining. Morphological awareness, while having no apparent facilitating effect on word retention, greatly enhanced learners' lexical inferring and coining abilities. It is recommended that the root and patterns system be trained starting as early as the first semester as an integral part of lexical development activities.

Abstract = {Vocabulary knowledge plays a critical role in the learning of a foreign language. In order to read, write, listen, or speak in any language one must have a basic knowledge of at least some of the words used in the target language. Research in the area of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) reveals that computers can enhance students' learning when dealing with grammatical topics. However, there is very little research, especially at the K-12 level, that focuses on CALL and vocabulary learning. The purpose of this study therefore was to examine the effects of a computer-assisted vocabulary learning (CAVL) program on beginning foreign language learners' vocabulary acquisition. The study sought to explore the students' productive and receptive vocabulary learning, as well as their attitudes toward using a CAVL program. This study, which is classified as practitioner research, employed a mixed design with both quantitative and qualitative methods. The participants included 51 eighth grade students who were enrolled in French 1 in a public magnet middle school. The results of this study indicate that the CAVL program was successful in significantly increasing students' receptive and productive knowledge of foreign language vocabulary words. Additionally, the CAVL program was moderately successful in increasing the lexical quality of students' writing. Results of an open-ended, qualitative survey indicated that not only did the students overwhelmingly express a positive attitude toward using the CAVL program, but the vast majority of students found it to be an effective learning tool. Further study is recommended in order to examine the effectiveness of the CAVL in an empirical setting. Additionally, while the current study was designed for 6 weeks, future studies may consider lengthening the time of data collection in order to better examine the effects of the CAVL program on the lexical quality of students' writing.

Abstract = {Object naming is essentially a mnemonic task of accessing stored associations between visual and auditory features. Therefore, understanding the neural basis of naming requires a better understanding of the means by which these and similar associations are acquired, stored, and retrieved from long-term memory. Presented here are a series of three experiments designed to address these questions using a novel paired associate memory paradigm in which the same image sound pairings can be recalled nonlinguistically or linguistically, depending on experience. Twelve participants were trained to pair images of animals, degraded using low-pass filers, with sine-wave speech analogues of the spoken animal name; though unaware of the potential linguistic content. The neuroanatomic basis of memory recall for these pairs, as well as additional nonlinguistic controls, is examined over time using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. The first experiment identifies the neural network related to accurate pair recall immediately after successful pair learning, and how this substrate evolves during the task time-course. Regions within the hippocampal complex were identified and their functional connectivity to other neo- and subcortical regions was mapped. The second experiment examines how the neural substrate of associate memory recall is altered by time by comparing regions involved in successful immediate recall to those involved in recall one month later. Seven predications of the standard model of systems level consolidation, including decreased activity in some medial temporal regions, were confirmed though the full pattern of results is potentially irreconcilable with the theory. The final experiment examines the patterns of memory storage by identifying how the locus of visual memory changes when participants become aware of the linguistic nature of the paired stimuli. Utilizing a lexical strategy resulted in magnitude but not location changes in the fusiform and inferior temporal gyri, providing strong evidence against theories which propose that memories are stored in anatomically distinct regions according to semantic categories or category features. The full pattern of consolidation and lexical status related effects argues for a modified process specific theory of memory where inter-regional connectivity, varying dynamically with task demands, plays a key role in lexical memory storage and recall.

Abstract = {Many English language learning students transition to mainstream academic classes before they have developed complete linguistic competence. An achievement gap can develop between these bilingual learners and their native speaking peers. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of computer-based lexical glossing intervention designed to facilitate incidental vocabulary acquisition in English language learning students. The theoretical base that grounded the study was the cognitive theory of multimedia proposed by Mayer in 2001. Four research questions guided the testing of the intervention on both beginning and intermediate English language learning students. The study employed an experimental, randomized, posttest-only, control group design with an immediate and delayed recall test. Two subpopulations of 105 limited English proficient students each were created and treated under different gloss conditions. The score achieved on an immediate or delayed posttest served as the dependant variable while the gloss condition served as the independent variable. A 2x3 factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed on the scores of the immediate posttest revealed a significant main effect for gloss condition in the beginning group, but no significant main effect for gender and no significant interaction effect. In the intermediate group, no significant main effect was revealed for gloss condition on either posttest, but a significant main effect for gender was detected on posttests. Results of this study indicate that teacher's can close the achievement gap for English language learning students and promote social change by using research based lexical interventions.

Abstract = {This dissertation investigates the acquisition of English yes/no questions. Previous studies have restricted themselves to the acquisition of 'inversion' or movement transformations. As a result, a great deal of child and adult data which do not show inversion (non-canonical questions) have never been analyzed. My account remedies this by providing the first model of acquisition that integrates language variation as an important motor in development. My main hypothesis is that children hear a variety of question forms of different complexity from adults (Coming? You coming? You're coming? Are you coming?), and that this variation facilitates learning. I show first that the different variants can be ordered in a relation of increasing structural complexity. I use American English data from CHILDES to show that parents use all forms in their speech to children, and that in fact, the canonical 'inverted' form is rarer than people have assumed (between 33% and 57% of all yes/no questions). Reduced and declarative forms are quite frequent and productive. I then analyze child time series data to show that simpler forms emerge early and facilitate the acquisition of more complex forms. This incremental structure-building process depends on the availability of an adjunction strategy that takes reduced child questions and augments them with initial auxiliaries and subjects. This account draws on Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development: each developmental stage lays the foundation for the kinds of knowledge currently accessible to the learner. Moreover, I show that the availability of this incremental process is contingent on the high frequency of non-canonical questions in parental speech: the single child in my corpus who receives mostly canonical input employs a completely different, top down strategy. The approach here differs from both movement-based approaches and item-based ones. It shifts the focus away from problems of learnability that seldom assess how child knowledge at a given point determines what is learnable and how. It also adopts a view of the target as a constraint-based, surfacist grammar, with no movement transformations. In addition, I claim that the structure-building process is not necessarily based on specific lexical items or combinations thereof. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study investigates the use of authentic subtitled similar task videos (ASSTVs) and their relationship to second language negotiation of meaning and language production among non-native speakers of English in an online task-based language learning (TBLL) environment. Over the course of two weeks, twenty intermediate nonnative speakers (NNSs) of English from the English Language Institute at Texas A&M University engaged in four communicative tasks in pairs using an online TBLL environment designed specifically for this study, and a chat tool in WebCT Vista, a course management system provided by the university. ASSTVs were videotaped and integrated into the online TBLL environment. Participants were divided into two groups, each of which consisted of five dyads, to test the effects of ASSTVs. Five dyads were provided with the ASSTVs and the remaining five dyads were not provided with them before the task completion process. The first section of this study examines the effects of ASSTVs on negotiation of meaning, and the second section examines the effects on language production. The amount of negotiation of meaning was calculated through the negotiation of meaning sequences model developed by Gass and Varonis and revised for online communication by Smith. Language production was investigated in terms of fluency and complexity with regard to lexical and syntactic complexity. A detailed analysis of the data from the chat-scripts showed that NNSs engage in more negotiation of meaning and produce more fluent and lexically diverse language when provided with the ASSTVs than NNSs who were not provided with them. Based on these findings, this study concludes that using ASSTVs in an online TBLL environment is a viable and effective tool for promoting negotiation of meaning and language production in terms of fluency and lexical complexity.

In bringing together theory and research relevant to multiple levels of meaning and multiple sources of context effects, Simpson has produced a volume that will serve as an important reference volume for students of semantic and syntactic influences on lexical access and comprehension.

Abstract = {Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is an aphasic dementia syndrome caused by neurodegenerative disease in which linguistic abilities are selectively disrupted in the relative absence of other cognitive deficits in early stages. The studies presented in this thesis were designed to examine the integrity of word and object processing by contrasting performance on implicit and explicit memory tests in the logopenic and agrammatic subtypes of PPA. Both studies were cross-sectional in design, in that patients with PPA were compared with cognitively intact controls. Where appropriate, comparisons were made within the PPA group. Study 1 investigated word and picture recognition memory and the impact of semantically related distracters on memory in PPA. Study 2 examined how words and pictures are processed by PPA patients when they are primed by within-format or cross-format stimuli. The central hypothesis for both studies was that picture performance would be superior to that of words, as a result of the language deficit in PPA. Beyond this central hypothesis, each study was designed to identify additional areas of vulnerability in memory and lexical processing. The results suggest that, in the logopenic and agrammatic subtypes of PPA, successful memory performance is dependent on the format of the material (i.e., words or picture) and is susceptible to interference by semantically related stimuli. Patients were able to access semantic knowledge for both words and pictures but failed to show cross-format picture-to-word priming effects, suggesting difficulty linking a precise lexical label to an object. The degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio at the level of lexical, but not object, representations can be invoked to explain these results and may provide a general mechanism for word-finding and naming deficits in PPA. This model is consistent with the partial and selective loss of neurons within the language network. This work suggests that PPA can provide a model for exploring the symbiotic relationship between memory and language in a system where the damage is within neurocognitive networks rather than a result of vascular lesions. Results from the study have implications clinically as and contribute to the understanding of the organization of lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This dissertation examined language use by children and adolescents with the genetic disorder, Williams Syndrome (WS), specifically examining how they use referential (determiners and pronouns) and other cohesive devices (tense and conjunctions) to develop narratives based on a storybook. The study also examined grammatical and lexical errors in narratives and conversations as well as the relationship between linguistic proficiency and chronological age, age of speech onset, and verbal IQ. WS children (n=18; CA=10;9; MA=7;6) were compared to typically developing mentally age (MA) matched children (n=18; CA=7;2, MA=7;7). A subset of the WS children (n=10; CA=9;8) was compared to chronologically age (CA) matched children (n=10; CA=9;4). The study found that WS children used referential and cohesive devices in narratives similarly to MA-matched children, but made more errors in tense and referential cohesion than CA-matched children. WS children's grammatical error rates in conversations and in narratives were not different from the MA-matched children, but were higher than the CA-matched group. For lexical errors, WS children showed no difference from the MA-matched group in conversations, but made more errors than the CA-matched group. Notably, WS children made more lexical errors than both the MA and CA-matched groups in their narratives. Correlations for the WS children showed that verbal IQ and chronological age were better predictors of linguistic performance than age of speech onset. Overall, these findings demonstrate that WS children's accurate use of grammar is delayed, but is following a normative developmental pattern. Their ability to tense, determiners, and pronouns for cohesion was also delayed and was related to the ability to coordinate the use of the structures throughout the narratives. The unexpected finding for lexical errors in narratives demonstrates that WS children have particular difficulties with naming, suggesting either problems with lexical access or lexical representations.

Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted in order to investigate how the right and left cerebral hemispheres recognize visually presented words pre-lexically. Experiment I used the backward masking technique in which target words (e.g. crew) were backward masked by nonwords that were either orthographically and phonologically similar (e.g. CRUE), orthographically similar (e.g. CRAE), phonologically similar (e.g. KROO) or unrelated (e.g. FAMS). The stimuli were presented to either the right or left visual field using the divided visual field technique. Two SOAs, 20 ms and 60 ms, were investigated to track how orthographic and phonological processes change over time. Participants identified the target word using a two-alternative choice response (e.g. crew/grew). Experiment 2 used a priming technique in which words from inconsistent orthographic neighborhoods (e.g. MINT) were primed by related (e.g. _INT) or unrelated (e.g. _AMP) orthographic bodies. Primes were centrally presented, and target words were presented to the right or left visual field using the divided visual field technique. Target words either had the frequent pronunciation for their orthographic neighborhood (e.g. MINT) or the infrequent pronunciation (e.g. PINT) determined by the summed log frequency of all words in an orthographic neighborhood that shared the same pronunciation. Again, time course was investigated by using a 20 ms SOA and a 70 ms SOA. The results from both experiments revealed the right hemisphere gains access to both phonology and orthography during the earliest moments of word recognition (20 ms SOA). However, the right hemisphere was benefited to a greater degree by orthographic similarity than by phonological similarity at both the short and long SOAs. The left hemisphere also demonstrates access to phonology and orthography in the initial moments of word recognition. The effect of both orthographic and phonological similarity is not greater than the effect of each type of similarity alone until later moments of word recognition (60 ms SOA). This suggests the left hemisphere does not summate these two forms of information until slightly later during word recognition at which point a deeper representation is available. The results suggest each hemisphere makes a meaningful contribution to word recognition prior to lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This dissertation focuses on the unique aspects of Maltese morphology brought about by its genetic and geographic history. The experiments conducted and described here build on past research in Indo-European languages and new research in other Semitic languages to determine how different word formation systems function. Applying experimental techniques to the study of Maltese is crucial for two reasons. First, though Maltese is a Semitic language, recent extensive contact with English has greatly impacted its vocabulary and the structure of its verbs. Though the effects of persistent language contact is pervasive, clear and systematic differences may be observed between native Semitic verbs and those borrowed from English. Secondly, unlike other Semitic languages, the Maltese writing system uses the Roman alphabet. This allows for tests that require the reading of written stimuli to be performed in the same writing system as previous studies in Indo-European languages, eliminating a number of confounding factors. A masked priming experiment asked Maltese speakers to judge whether or not test items were words of their language. The test items included real and nonce verbs of both Semitic and English origin. Accuracy rates and reaction time were recorded and compared across speakers. The results of this experiment support the psychological salience of the consonantal root as a unit of lexical organization. An elicitation experiment asked native speakers of Maltese to provide a verb form that corresponded to a given noun or adjective. The test items were nouns of Semitic and English origin and non-words constructed to resemble such nouns. Responses were broadly transcribed and analyzed for their similarity to the expected patterns. The results show that speakers are able to use two morphological strategies to form new words. The factors affecting the choice between morphological systems include linguistic structure and social variables. Collectively, this pair of experiments indicate that the consonantal root is a viable morphological and psychological unit of lexical organization, supporting a search-based approach to lexical access. Furthermore, speakers are able to form new words on the basis of whole words, showing that this level of organization must also be present to facilitate lexical access.

At least a part of semantic priming effects observed in binary decision tasks is supposed to be caused by decision biases. A semantic relationship between prime and target could positively bias a 'yes' response, whereas the absence of a relationship would instead favour a 'no' response to the same target. We tested this assumption with a semantic categorization task in which participants were induced to associate different values--positive, negative, or neutral--to each of the categorization decisions. Although semantic priming effects were obtained even with negatively valued decisions, they were substantially enhanced with positively valued decisions, confirming the influence of a decision bias induced presumptively by a post-lexical relatedness judgement.

Abstract = {There are several indications that the process of children's word-learning and the development of expertise are similar. These clues are found in both theoretical contentions and in prior experimental work. However several pieces of evidence were needed to make the link between lexical acquisition and expertise development explicit. The present research study provides that evidence. In a microgenetic study 4-year-old children were taught 450 new lexical items from three animal domains. Across 3 months children showed patterns of lexical learning that are similar to longer-term patterns of learning seen for experts. They also showed show evidence of increasing memory, perception, attention and abstraction - cognitive abilities that evidence advanced performance in experts and that are associated with increased domain knowledge. Finally the children showed show evidence of characteristics patterns of behavior previously documented in experts. It is argued that children can he thought of as developing expertise in word learning, that they are developing lexical expertise or 'lexpertise'.

Abstract = {In face-to-face communication, information from the face as well as from the voice contributes to the identification of spoken words. This dissertation investigates the time-course of the evaluation and integration of visual and auditory speech in audiovisual word identification. A large-scale audiovisual gating study extends previous research on this topic by (1) using a set of words that includes all possible initial consonants in English in three vowel contexts, (2) tracking the information processing for individual words not only across modalities, but also over time, and (3) testing quantitative models of the time-course of multimodal word recognition. There was an advantage in accuracy for audiovisual speech over auditory-only and visual-only speech. Auditory performance was, however, close to ceiling while performance on visual-only trials was near the floor of the scale, but well above chance. Visual information was used at all gates to identify the presented words. Information theoretic feature analyses of the confusion matrices revealed that the auditory signal is highly informative about voicing, manner, frication, duration, and place of articulation. Visual speech is mostly informative about place of articulation, but also about frication and duration. The auditory signal provides more information about the place of articulation for back consonants, whereas the visual signal provides more information for the labial consonants. The data were sufficient to discriminate between models of audiovisual word recognition. The Fuzzy Logical Model of Perception (FLMP; Massaro, 1998) gave a better account of the confusion matrix data than additive models of perception. A dynamic version of the FLMP was expanded to account for the evaluation and integration of information over time. This dynamic FLMP provided a better description of the data than dynamic additive competitor models. The present study builds a good foundation to investigate the role of the complex interplay between stimulus information and the structure of the lexicon. It provides an important step in building a formal representation of a lexical dynamic FLMP that can account not only for the time-course of speech information and its perceptual processing, but also for lexical influences.

We examined whether mothers' use of temporal synchrony between spoken words and moving objects, and infants' attention to object naming, predict infants' learning of word-object relations. Following 5 min of free play, 24 mothers taught their 6- to 8-month-olds the names of 2 toy objects, Gow and Chi, during a 3-min play episode. Infants were then tested for their word mapping. The videotaped episodes were coded for mothers' object naming and infants' attention to different naming types. Results indicated that mothers' use of temporal synchrony and infants' attention during play covaried with infants' word-mapping ability. Specifically, infants who switched eye gaze from mother to object most frequently during naming learned the word-object relations. The findings suggest that maternal naming and infants' word-mapping abilities are bidirectionally related. Variability in infants' attention to maternal multimodal naming explains the variability in early lexical-mapping development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

He compares 20 stutterers and 20 normal speakers on a battery of tests such as vocabulary, fluency, intelligence, story telling, story writing, and so forth. Overall, what are the strengths of the present book? First and foremost, it does provide a good detailed introduction to the language aspect of stuttering. Second, Wingate provides excellent summaries at the end of each major review. Third, the book presents an extremely biased account. Now back to the weaknesses. The study that is described and the theory of lexical access difficulty do not follow from the first five chapters. Wingate might have been better served by presenting the theory first, showing how the previous research supports or does not support the theory, and then presenting some new work that bears directly on the lexical access hypothesis.

Often, these applications suffer from the ambiguity of dictionary items, especially when an intermediate natural language is involved in the process of the dictionary construction, since this language adds its ambiguity to the ambiguity of working languages. This paper aims to propose a new method for producing multilingual dictionaries without the risk of introducing additional ambiguity. As a disambiguated intermediate language we use the so-called Universal Words. A set of more than 200,000 unambiguous Universal Words have been constructed automatically on the basis of the well-known English lexical database WordNet. This approach is being used for the construction of a five language-dictionary in the field of cultural heritage within the framework of the PATRILEX project sponsored by the Spanish Research Council.

Abstract = {Lexical processing can be facilitated by word-word relationships as well as message-level context. The experiments presented here sought to determine how word-word association and discourse congruity influence the reading process on-line. To assess this processing, ERPs and eye-tracking methodologies were used in parallel studies. These methods provide high temporal resolution and rich data sets from which to infer reading processes. Experiments 1 and 2 examined the processing of sentence-final words that varied in association with a preceding word and overall discourse congruity, using ERPs and eye-tracking, respectively. The manipulation of association took place locally, with only one to three words intervening between the prime and the target. Discourse congruence was manipulated by changing the first two sentences of the passage, while the sentence containing the critical word was always congruous when read in isolation. For Experiments 3 and 4, eye-tracking measures were analyzed for mid-sentence target words. In Experiment 3, these words were embedded in multi-sentence passages, and they varied in discourse congruence and association. For the fourth experiment, associated and unassociated word pairs were presented in isolated sentences without a manipulation of congruity. Effects of discourse congruity were robust in all experiments where that factor was manipulated. In ERPs this resulted in voltage differences in the 150-250 ms latency window, as well as the classic N400 epoch (300-500 ms). In the eye-tracking studies differences in first-pass reading measures were found in the target region far sentence-final words and the post-target region for sentence-final and mid-sentence incongruities. Association, on the other hand, only had significant effects on the N400 in congruent cases. Effects of association for incongruent words were only marginal in the N400 time window, becoming significant in the LPC epoch (500-900 ms). For words embedded in passages, association had a marginal effect on first-pass reading of sentence-final words, but not mid-sentence words. Finally, significant effects of association were found for word pairs embedded in isolated sentences. Therefore, while effects of discourse congruence were robust across methods and sentential position, the effects of association were more tenuous. These results highlight the importance of global, discourse representations on lexical processing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The goal of the present study was to examine the cognitive nature of second language (L2) lexical processing in sentence context. Recent psycholinguistic research has provided evidence that bilingual lexical access is language non-selective in nature and that when bilinguals recognize words, information from both languages is activated in parallel. These non-selective findings have shaped current models of bilingual lexical activation and our understanding of how the bilingual lexicon is organized. However, these findings have been primarily based on isolated word recognition. Since bilinguals function in context-rich environments, it is important to understand to what degree information provided by context modulates language non-selectivity. In the present study we examined the influence of sentence context by comparing bilinguals' lexical processes in out-of-context, and sentence-context tasks. Our goal was to determine whether the top-down process of L2 sentence comprehension interact directly with the bottom-up processes of lexical access and whether this interaction would constrain language non-selectivity. In the first set of experiments we examined bilinguals' L2 word recognition performance for language-ambiguous words (e.g., cognates and interlingual homographs) in two out-of-context tasks (word naming and lexical decision). These experiments replicated the effects of cross-language activation that have been observed in the literature. In the second set of experiments the same critical words were inserted in high constraint and low constraint sentences. The findings demonstrated that effects of language non-selective access persisted in low constraint sentences. This suggests that the language context provided by a sentence is not sufficient to constrain non-selectivity. However, in high constraint sentences the effects of cross-language activation were eliminated for bilinguals with relatively high L2 comprehension skills. The results suggest that sentence context can indeed constrain non-selectivity when there is sufficient semantic information and processing resources to efficiently suppress the non-target native language. Implications for current models of bilingual lexical access are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this work was to experimentally manipulate semantic storage and observe the effects on word recall in toddlers. Robustness of lexical-semantic storage has been associated with the success of retrieving a word from memory in school-age children (e.g., Bishop, 1997; Bjorklund, 1987; McGregor, Newman, Reilly, & Capone, 2002). Experience plays a crucial role in developing a detailed lexical-semantic entry. The current work showed that providing semantic enrichment during word learning resulted in greater access to word labels for naming than a control condition (no semantic enrichment). That is, the process of developing a richer lexical-semantic entry to support word retrieval was hastened, a process that would have presumably taken many more exposures to achieve. Nineteen typically developing English-speaking toddlers (mean age was 29-months) participated in a repeated measures paradigm with three word learning conditions. Spoken labels were provided in all conditions but iconic gestures highlighted objects' shape (shape condition) or function (function condition) in the experimental conditions. Objects were labeled nine times across three sessions while children were manipulating them. Across the study, several probes were administered to determine lexical-semantic storage (word comprehension, semantic gesture comprehension, expression of function information). Longer-term retention was assessed via picture naming and comprehension tasks. Analyses showed that semantic enrichment had positive effects on word recall with the most robust effects in the shape condition. Compared to the control condition, the shape condition supported more uncued naming and the function condition supported more cued naming responses. The difference between these conditions appeared related to enhanced fast mapping in the shape condition. Evidence of greater semantic storage is also provided in the shape and function conditions than in the control condition. The results are discussed in terms of the newest component of working memory, the episodic buffer, as well as the role shape plays in linking lexical and semantic domains.

Abstract = {During the first year of life, infants are engaged in the process of discovering words in the speech stream. In order to do this, they must understand the way in which sounds are meaningfully organized in their native language and use this information to form lexical categories which group instances of words. The purpose of this dissertation is to establish what might constitute language input to infants and how infants use cues in the input to learn words. As a first step, infants' preferences for vocal affect and speech register (infant-directed versus adult-directed speech) were assessed in order to determine the kinds of initial biases infants bring to language learning. Results revealed a consistent preference for positive vocal affect that overrides their preference for IDS. Given these findings, the next set of studies investigated how positive vocal affect influences infants' abilities to learn words in fluent speech. Results from these word recognition studies revealed no effects of positive affect on word recognition. Instead, 7.5 month old infants only recognized words if they were presented in the same affect as previous encounters, resulting in a matching effect. A replication of this design with older infants showed that at 10.5 months, infants recognized instances of words regardless of whether they matched in affect. Further studies investigated the extent to which infants exploit affective variability in the input to arrive at higher-order representations of words. Results showed that at 7.5 months, infants are capable of more mature word recognition under conditions of high variability. Overall, this set of studies suggests that infants are predisposed to capitalize on variability and constancy in their environment as a means to forming stable lexical categories.

Abstract = {Does word reading depend more on high or low spatial-frequency information? Although word recognition is often thought by lay people to be a fine detail task, alternative perspectives have been proposed in which the low spatial-frequency information contained in the global word form is processed more quickly than the details. Low spatial-frequencies may merely facilitate word recognition or may be sufficient for a rapid lexical decision (Is that a word?). The premise that low spatial-frequencies are sufficient for facilitating and/or making lexical decisions was examined in the present study. Letter strings were filtered with 3 types of spatial-frequency filter (low pass, high-pass, medium spatial-frequency notch) and unfiltered control. Proficient readers made lexical decisions under unprimed and masked primed conditions. In the unprimed condition, a filtered target was presented for 105 or 400 ms followed, after a 30 ms interstimulus interval (ISI), by a pattern mask. In the masked priming condition, a forward mask was presented for 150 ms, followed 30 ms later by the filtered prime, which was then followed by an unfiltered target after a 30 ms ISI. Naming and lexical decision tasks were completed for the masked priming condition. Sensitivity (d') in the unprimed condition was lowest for the low-pass targets at both ISIs. Both low- and high-pass filtered words (<3.5 cpd and >4.6 cpd respectively) produced significant priming effects in the lexical decision task. Low-pass words, however, were not sufficient to facilitate a naming response. In contrast, high-pass words were sufficient to prime a naming response. The data do not support a unique role for low spatial-frequencies in either making a rapid lexical decision or in facilitating lexical decision or naming. The data do suggest that the medium and high spatial-frequencies may be important to lexical decision and naming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This thesis investigates the perceptual categories associated with contrasting pitch accents in Tokyo Japanese. Various aspects of pitch movements throughout the words are systematically varied in order to determine what aspects of the pitch contour affect categorization of words on the basis of accent. In addition, this thesis also investigates the effect on categorization of loss of pitch due to lack of voicing in various parts of the word. The model determined by these studies reveals two more-or-less orthogonal perceptual dimensions; pitch alignment with speech segments determines accent location and the amount of pitch drop determines accent presence. This study also investigates how to quantify the distinctive function of pitch accent in a way which incorporates the frequency of the contrasting items, as well as the peculiar category structure of accents. This model was applied in the analysis of a large-scale lexical database, revealing many irregularities in the distribution and use of accents. Comparing this quantification of the lexical use of accent with the perceptual experiments shows that accent-location detection is functionally more fundamental than accent-presence detection in short, 2-mora words.

Abstract = {The work presented here investigates the question of how well nonlinguistic information supports a model of lexical acquisition that relies solely on a word to world pairing procedure. We explored the hypothesis that nonlinguistic context is sufficient to enable the learner to infer the meaning of some words but insufficient for others. The child language acquisition literature documents that children's early vocabularies are heavily dominated by nouns and contain fewer verbs. Therefore, we first investigated the identification of common nouns and verbs when information about word meaning was restricted to observation of the extralinguistic context in which the word was used. The noun-verb difference is often attributed to the conceptual maturity of the learner since verbs have been described as conceptually more difficult. To focus on the information available rather than the conceptual abilities of the learner, we simulated the language acquisition performance of young children with conceptually mature subjects. Adults were given a task in which they had to identify word meaning for the 24 most frequent nouns and 24 most frequent verbs in a sample of maternal speech to young language learners. We found significant differences in the ability to correctly identify nouns and verbs that paralleled the noun advantage found in the child literature. The nonlinguistic context supported noun learning significantly better than verb learning; however, there was significant variation among items that was that nonlinguistic information is insufficient to account for all word learning has theoretical implications for a word to world pairing model of lexical acquisition. We present an alternative model of lexical acquisition that explores the interface between the acquisition of lexical items and the acquisition of syntax. A word to world pairing procedure can account for a set of concrete terms, primarily nouns. This set of words then provides cues to clause-level syntax. Once the learner has acquired syntactic knowledge, the available sources of information about word meaning become linguistic and nonlinguistic. Such a proposal includes both sentence to world pairing procedures and word to world pairing procedures to account for lexical acquisition.

Abstract = {Lexical access is the process by which the information needed for word production is retrieved from the mental dictionary. In the course of lexical access speakers need (a) to choose the one word, from the thousands in the lexicon, that best conveys the intended meaning, and (b) to retrieve the information necessary for incorporating the word in a given context. This information is of two sorts: syntactic and phonological. The thesis presents three series of experiments. A first series of experiments examines the mechanisms responsible for choosing the intended word. A second series of experiments investigates how syntactic information is retrieved and used to select words such as articles, whose production depends on the prior selection of syntactic information. A third series of experiments focuses on the retrieval of word syllables and phonemes.

Abstract = {This dissertation tested the hypothesis that perceptual implicit memory is affected not just by the prior perceptual processing, but also by prior decisions resulting from the perceptual processing. According to the proposed view, three aspects of the context can potentially affect the level of perceptual implicit memory-the physical context (what are the surroundings in which the stimulus occurs and a decision is made?), the decision processing context (what kind of decision is being made about the stimulus?), and the response context (what action is taken based upon the decision that is reached?).  Three predictions of the proposed view were tested. The first prediction was that higher levels of perceptual implicit memory should be found when the decision made concerning the word at test matches the decision made concerning the word at encoding. The second prediction was that higher levels of perceptual implicit memory should be found when the response made to the word at test matches the response made to word at encoding. The third prediction was that higher levels of perceptual implicit memory should be found when the physical context surrounding the word at encoding is important to the decision processes and matches the test context. The predictions were tested in three experiments. Each of the experiments tested for the presence of a context-dependency effect in perceptual implicit memory. Experiment 1 tested for the presence of a decision process context-dependency effect. Experiment 2 tested for the presence of a response process context-dependency effect. Experiments 3a and 3b tested for the presence of a physical (environmental) context-dependency effect. No evidence was found to support the proposed view. No context-dependency effect was found in any of the experiments. Together, the results provide support for the standard view that perceptual implicit memory only reflects changes within a perceptual, lexical processing system.

Abstract = {Disordered sentence comprehension in aphasia may be due in part to deficient lexical-semantic processes. There are conflicting accounts as to whether these difficulties occur in initial word meaning activation, or in later meaning integration processes. Any such deficits in aphasia, however, must be interpreted with reference to lexical access processes in normal comprehension. Despite a wealth of research, the mechanisms involved in the retrieval of word meanings in sentence contexts are the subject of vigorous debate. Essentially, two competing psycholinguistic models of initial meaning activation can be distinguished: an interactive account, postulating a constraining influence of context on meaning activation; and a modular account, claiming that meaning activation is autonomous and independent of context. To contrast predictions of these accounts, this study used a cross-modal priming task to investigate activation of alternate meanings of ambiguous words in sentence contexts biased towards specific semantic features of those meanings. Seven adults with Broca-type aphasia and ten age-matched control subjects made speeded lexical decisions to visually-presented probe words. Probes were either unrelated to, or semantically related to, the dominant or subordinate meanings of ambiguous words embedded in auditorily presented sentences. For dominant-biased contexts, a constraint-based account predicts selective meaning activation, expressed in faster response times to probes reflecting the contextually appropriate meaning of the ambiguity than to other probes. A modular account predicts activation of all meanings, despite biasing context. Thus, response times to both the contextually appropriate and inappropriate probes should be faster than those to unrelated probes. Neither group evidenced a response time advantage for either type of related probe when compared to unrelated probes, even after adjusting for unequal probe frequency. This unexpected result is not congruent with predictions from either of the models of normal lexical access. The findings for aphasic participants accord with one of the three contrasting accounts for lexical processing deficits in individuals with Broca's aphasia. Due to the uninterpretable findings for the control subjects, however, no conclusions are possible for the participants with aphasia. The discussion addresses potential methodological confounds in this and previous studies examining word meaning activation in a cross-modal lexical decision task.

Abstract = {Face recognition is subject to severe impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to Bruce and Young's model (1986), face recognition includes pre-semantic, semantic, and output stages. The present study used explicit memory tasks to establish lexical output abilities and an implicit memory task to assess semantic abilities, and it examined spatial frequency contrast sensitivity as a possible pre-semantic source of face discrimination deficits. Subjects included individuals diagnosed with probable AD (n = 27) and age-matched control participants (n = 21). The new Implicit Face Recognition Test tested familiarity of famous faces with four conditions of relatedness (highly-associated, categorically-related, neutral, and unrelated) and examined the effects of cuing on face recognition in AD. Assessment of reaction time was the measure of the facilitation benefit of semantic relatedness (priming). Performance on the priming task was contrasted with that on measures of explicit memory (recall and recognition) of the same faces administered in a separate session. AD patients performed poorly on the explicit memory tasks, as expected. By contrast, facilitation as a result of categorical relatedness was evidenced in both the AD and control groups, suggesting that their explicit face recognition deficits were the result of a retrieval problem rather than a breakdown of semantic knowledge. Additionally, poor performance on face recognition tasks without cues may indicate a breakdown in pre-semantic processing. One pre-semantic structural process that is impaired in AD is contrast sensitivity, particularly at low spatial frequencies. The AD group showed face discrimination performance that was equal to that of the control group when sensitivity to low, but not higher, spatial frequency information was enhanced through manipulation of face size. These results indicate that patients with AD are able to use their preserved semantic knowledge (stage 3 of Bruce and Young's model), presumably supported by lateral temporal structures, to benefit from associative cues and thereby enhance face recognition abilities. Additionally they demonstrate deficits in processing pre-semantic input (stage 2), specifically spatial frequency contrast sensitivity information contained in structural codes, and lexical output (stage 4).

Abstract = {Radicals are not only constituent components of Chinese orthography, but also basic processing units in character recognition. The present study investigated the role of radical components in character recognition and the interrelationship between the processing of radicals and characters. Horizontally structured Chinese characters were used as stimulus materials, with each character containing two radicals. In Experiments 1 to 4, the participants were required to identify the particular radicals in the stimulus characters that were displayed briefly. It was found that radicals in high frequency characters were recognized faster and more accurately than radicals in low-frequency characters, and that radicals on the right side of characters were recognized better than those on the left side. The magnitude of the position effect was even greater for low-frequency characters. The task in Experiments 5 to 9 was character decision, in which the participants were required to judge whether a stimulus item was a real character or not. The results indicate that the speed and accuracy of character recognition can be improved under the following conditions: (1) when the semantic relation between a character and its radical is close; (2) when a character contains a radical that is also a character by itself; (3) when the right radical in a character has a high type frequency (i.e., the radical can form many characters with other radicals); and (4) when the frequency of the stimulus character is high. Similar to the radical identification task, the interaction between radical level factors and character frequency has been found consistently in the character decision experiments. The effects of radical's semantic cueing function, lexicality and type frequency were greater for low-frequency characters. The results from the two sets of experiments in the present study imply that character recognition involves processing at both the character and the radical level and that activation at different levels interact with each other. When the properties of radicals provide information relevant to character level processing, character recognition is facilitated. The processing of radicals at different positions in characters is not conducted in a completely parallel way. Furthermore, radical processing depends on character level processing. Once the processing at the higher character level is completed, the lower level units will not be processed any more. In summary, the present study specified the role of radical components in character recognition and offered an interactive activation view of lexical processing in Chinese.

Abstract = {Lexical decision and pronunciation tasks were used to investigate semantic priming, the finding that a word is quicker to recognize when it is preceded by a related than an unrelated stimulus. The first experiment involved a lexical decision task (LDT) in which skilled and less-skilled readers made decisions about letter strings that were preceded by conceptually-related or unrelated stimuli. The effects of time to process the prime and type of prime (word or picture) were examined. Word and picture priming effects were observed at short and long time intervals with skilled and less-skilled groups. Finding word priming was not surprising; there are prior studies that have documented priming by words. However, prior experiments on picture priming have methodological flaws such as multiple presentations of stimuli that make it unclear whether pictures can prime word targets through semantic and nonstrategic routes. The facilitation of word targets following word primes may be due to semantic relations as well as associative relations. While picture priming provides evidence of semantic priming, picture priming cannot be associative at a lexical level because no orthographic features are displayed. During the processing of a picture, information about the picture and its related concepts are activated which facilitates processing of a subsequently presented word. The effect of priming was greater with picture primes than word primes, perhaps because the associations were stronger between the picture-word pairs than the word-word pairs. Because priming in a LDT may be attributed to postlexical checking, priming was further investigated in a pronunciation task in which the strategy is not helpful. In Experiment 2, in which subjects pronounced words that were preceded by related or unrelated pictures, the priming effect was significant. Finding a picture priming effect is important; it supports the interactive view that pictures provide a context that affects the processes that occur before word recognition. Priming must be due to semantic associations between the picture prime and the words corresponding to related concepts. Word and picture priming can be explained by current models of lexical access.

Abstract = {Studies of inflectional languages have demonstrated that Broca's aphasics find it more difficult to produce verbs than nouns, while Wernicke's aphasics show the opposite profile. Explanations for this double dissociation include several single-factor accounts such as grammatical accounts (e.g., verb deficits reflect the greater morphological or syntactic complexity of verbs), semantic-conceptual accounts (e.g., verbs are based on action meanings, which are stored in anterior motor regions; nouns are based on object meanings, which are stored in sensory cortex), and lexical accounts (verbs and nouns are stored in separate regions of the brain, independent of their semantic content). In Chinese, many words are compounds with a complex internal structure, including VN compound verbs like 'SHUI-JIAO' (literally sleep-sleep, meaning 'to sleep') and VN compound nouns like 'FEI-JI' (literally fly-machine, meaning 'airplane'). Hence, noun-verb dissociations between Broca's aphasics and Wernicke's aphasics may occur at the lexical level and the sublexical level. Such sublexical dissociation would provide a challenge to existing explanations. To explore this possibility, an object and action naming study was conducted with Chinese Broca's and Wernicke's aphasics, designed to elicit several different compound types (VN nouns, VN verbs, NN nouns, VNN nouns, and NNN nouns). Results of the present study demonstrate both lexical and sublexical noun-verb dissociations between Broca's aphasics and Wernicke's aphasics, and provide evidence for the interaction of sublexical noun-verb dissociations with word structure frequency, e.g., sublexical noun-verb dissociations are significant in non-major word types but are insignificant in major word types. Additionally, a frequency effect is observed in the access of whole words, components, and word structures, e.g., the more complex two-morpheme word structure has higher accessibility than the simpler single-morpheme word structure. The presence of noun-verb dissociations at the lexical and the intra-lexical levels and their interaction with frequency effects cannot be explained by any single-factor account discussed above. However, the complex phenomenon observed in Chinese aphasia can be accounted for by connectionist models such as the Competition Model, which consider the interaction of relevant factors at both lexical and intra-lexical levels.

Abstract = {The current research investigated the effects of within category acoustic variation on lexical form processing and lexical access in normal and aphasic subjects. The first two experiments examined whether reductions in initial VOT values would affect repetition priming. Results show that hearing reduced VOT stimuli does not result in reduced repetition priming for normal subjects. This suggests that over time, poor word exemplars fully activate their lexical representations, leading to equally fast responses to second presentations of words regardless of whether the initial presentation is acoustically altered. In addition, it appears that gradations in activation may be modified by top-down processing effects: when reduced VOT stimuli follow intact exemplars young normals show a weak subphonetic effect, while older normals show no effect. In contrast to both normal and Wernicke's subjects, Broca's aphasics display slower reaction times to word presentations following reduced VOT stimuli, and show no repetition priming for words when reduced VOT exemplars are presented second. A second set of experiments examined whether lengthening initial VOT values, although resulting in exemplars further from the voiced-voiceless phonetic boundary, would affect the magnitude of semantic priming in a lexical decision task. Results indicate that increasing VOT by +4/3 affects the magnitude of semantic priming for young normals, suggesting that lexical activation is reduced when incoming acoustic information provides a poorer exemplar of a phonetic category, regardless of whether the poor exemplar is near or far from a phonetic category boundary. Unlike young normals, neither older normals or Wernicke's aphasics display a reduction in the amount of semantic priming following +4/3 VOT primes. Broca's aphasics, however, show reduced semantic priming when the +4/3 VOT prime has a lexical competitor (e.g., 'pill to bill'). The results of the current research indicate that Broca's aphasics in particular are affected by subphonetic variations, and are especially sensitive to the presence of both phonetic contrasts and lexical competitors. The results support the idea that activation is graded based on the goodness of the speech signal, as well as the idea that aphasics may suffer from an impairment in the processes underlying lexical access.

Abstract = {This research investigated the relationship between subphonetic variations in the acoustic cues associated with phonetic contrasts and lexical access in neurologically intact adults and patients with Broca's aphasia. A number of acoustic manipulations were performed on the test stimuli, including a reduction in voice-onset time in word-initial voiceless stop consonants (cf. Andruski, Blumstein, & Burton, 1994), an increase in vowel duration in lax vowels, and a removal of phonation in the closure interval of word-final voiced stop consonants. The perceptual effect of these manipulations was explored in tests of phonetic discrimination and identification. In addition, lexical decision tasks were administered in which the manipulated stimuli served as primes paired with semantically related targets, to determine whether subphonetic acoustic differences affect semantic facilitation in these groups. The results for normal subjects demonstrate that listeners are sensitive to subphonetic acoustic differences in the perception of phonetic segments. Specifically, subjects demonstrated increased reaction times to acoustically altered stimuli in both the discrimination and identification tasks, even though the acoustic manipulations did not change how the phonetic segments were categorized. Further, the acoustic manipulations significantly reduced the amount of semantic facilitation obtained in the lexical decision task at a 50 ms ISI, whereas equivalent facilitation emerged for intact and altered primes at a 250 ms ISI. Moreover, similar effects were obtained for consonant and vowel contrasts, for contrasts involving temporal and spectral acoustic cues, and for manipulations of segments in initial, medial, and final position. The results for Broca's aphasics demonstrate that, like normal subjects, these patients are perceptually sensitive to subphonetic acoustic differences. Specifically, these patients showed increased reaction times to stimuli that were acoustically altered in the discrimination task. In the lexical decision task, Broca's aphasics showed a similar pattern of performance to normal subjects in response to acoustic manipulations after the onset of the word. However, unlike normal subjects, these patients showed significant effects of lexical competitor on semantic facilitation in response to acoustic manipulations at word onset.

Abstract = {This study reports two experiments assessing the spelling performance of French first graders after 3 months and after 9 months of literacy instruction. The participants were asked to spell high and low frequency irregular words (Experiment 1) and pseudowords, some of which had lexical neighbours (Experiment 2). The lexical database which children had been exposed to was strictly controlled. Both a frequency effect in word spelling accuracy and an analogy effect in pseudoword spelling were obtained after only 3 months of reading instruction. The results suggest that children establish specific orthographic knowledge from the very beginning of literacy acquisition.

Abstract = {The primary purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that implicit memory for spoken words results from the operations of a memory system devoted to pattern recognition. Pattern recognition entails pre-lexical processes, which produce a detailed record of the acoustic characteristics of a speaker's voice along with subword information. To test this hypothesis, the relation between speech perception and implicit memory was examined. Auditory repetition priming was employed as the behavioral expression of implicit memory. Phoneme monitoring latencies were used to measure speech perception and memory processes. In addition to testing the main hypothesis, Experiment 1 investigated the detrimental effect of speaker variability on memory; Experiment 2 examined whether expectations can modulate this effect; and Experiment 3 assessed the effect of voice familiarity. The results showed that although speech perception operations entailed the use of word information, implicit memory relied on pre-lexical operations. Consistent with this finding, the number of speakers comprising the acoustic environment was found to produce a linear decrement in auditory priming. Stable acoustic changes in a multiple-speaker environment during the encoding of a set of spoken words rather than expectations regarding these changes were found to modulate the detrimental effect of speaker variability on memory. Voice familiarity, however, did not improve memory. Taken together, the present findings indicate that implicit memory of spoken words entails the encoding, storage and retrieval of speaker-specific episodic representations, which are pre-lexical in nature.

Abstract = {The affective primacy hypothesis (Zajonc, 1980) contends that people are able to react to the affective qualities (positive-negative) of a stimulus before they are able to react to non-affective qualities. Previous experiments (e.g., Murphy, 1990; Murphy, Monahan, & Zajonc; Murphy & Zajonc, 1993) utilizing facial expressions as affective primes, find strong evidence for affective primacy. The present set of experiments extends the scope of affective primacy to the lexical domain. Four experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that people are able to react to the affective quality of a word before they are able to react to the word's meaning. Two judgment tasks (Experiments 1 and 2) and a priming task (Experiments 3 and 4) were employed. When participants were exposed to word pairs for brief durations (Experiment 1, word pair shown for 150 msec; Experiment 2, prime word shown for 50 msec, followed by target word), they were faster to make valence judgments about the word pairs than they were to make judgments about the meanings of the two words. Experiments 3 and 4 utilized a pronunciation task to compare affective and semantic priming effects at two prime durations. When the prime words were exposed for a long duration (500 msec, Experiment 3), only semantic priming effects emerged. However, when the prime words were shown briefly (34 msec, Experiment 4), only affective priming effects emerged. The dissociation between the affective and semantic priming effects provides strong evidence that affect and cognition are processed by independent and partially separate systems. The results of Experiments 1-4 provide support for Zajonc's (1980) affective primacy hypothesis and extend previous findings of affective primacy (e.g., Murphy, 1990; Murphy, Monahan, & Zajonc, 1995; Murphy & Zajonc, 1993) into the lexical domain.

Abstract = {The article discusses a study on exploration of dictionary corpus of two-handed signs in American Sign Language (ASL), which tests the generalizability of two conditions, Symmetry Condition and Dominance Condition. It examines the full range of two-handed signs. The study takes into consideration that many predicates of motion that occur in ordinary conversation use two hands moving independently. It also notes that sometimes a sign has two distinct parts, where each part is of a different type. According to the authors, the conditions uncovered in the study might be morpheme structure constraints or follow from the physiological limitations of hands in motion. They conclude that signs group in a similar way but with some differences once the conditions are properly understood.},

Abstract = {The influence of identity and similarity of repeated items on the amount of repetition blindness (RB) was investigated in 3 rapid-serial-visual processing (RSVP) tasks. In one experiment, the difference between correct recall for sentences containing repeated identical items and their controls was contrasted with the difference between correct recall for sentences containing pairs of orthographically similar items (fish-dish) and their controls. In another experiment, the same comparison was made between sentences containing repeated identical items and sentences containing pairs of orthographically identical items (the watch-to watch). In the last experiment, pairs of morphologically related (walked-walk and walk-walked) items were presented in isolation among distractors. Performance on the morphological pairs was contrasted with performance on repeated identical (walk-walk and walked-walked) and orthographically similar (socket-sock and sock-socket) pairs. The amount of RB elicited by the repeated-identical and the other conditions was measured at different temporal lags. The first two experiments show that the performance over time for the repeated-identical condition differs from that for the orthographically similar (repeated-neighbors), and orthographically identical (repeated-homonyms) conditions. These results are interpreted as suggesting that the decrements in performance observed for recall of the second occurrence of the repeated item in the repeated-identical and the other conditions have different underlying causes. The last experiment shows that performance over time for the morphologically related pairs differs from performance for both the repeated-identical and the orthographically similar pairs. This result is interpreted in terms of morphological decomposition processes during lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a devastating disorder that affects approximately 0.29-0.48/1000 live born children. It is characterized by a pattern of facial malformations, pre- and/or postnatal growth deficiency, and CNS dysfunction. The most devastating features of FAS are the behavioral disturbances resulting from the CNS dysfunction. Children with FAS have been described as hyperactive, perseverative, and having attentional difficulties and are often mentally retarded. Until recently, brain abnormalities associated with FAS have been viewed as global and non-specific and thus not related to any specific pattern of behavioral dysfunction. Recently, however, studies of children with FAS have documented a disproportionate decrease in the volume of the basal ganglia, a group of subcortical brain structures that are involved in motor and cognitive abilities. This dissertation outlines a neurocognitive test of a model of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure based upon a framework of basal ganglia dysfunction. Fourteen children with FAS, 14 normal controls (NC) and 12 children with Down syndrome (DS) were assessed on six tasks including measures of motor programming, implicit and explicit memory, verbal fluency, and behavior. Experiments were chosen based on the literature on Huntington's disease, a neurological disorder with known neuropathology primarily in the basal ganglia. Results were analyzed by multivariate and univariate analyses of variance. Planned comparisons between the FAS and NC groups and FAS and DS groups were conducted using separate or pooled variance t-tests. When compared with the NC group, the children with FAS demonstrated deficits on measures of verbal fluency (p's <02) and behavioral ratings (p's <05) and there were trends towards deficits on motor programming, explicit memory, perseverative responses, and prism adaptation. In contrast no differences were found between the FAS group and the NC group on measures of lexical or (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In Exp 1, 20 university students who spoke Standard Mandarin Chinese (SMC) identified lexical tones for ambiguous, unambiguous, and nonsense words in phrasal contexts where the tone sandhi rule (TSR) might have applied. Comparable results in the lexical vs nonsense conditions indicate that judgments did not rely on lexically stored tonal information, but also made reference to the tonal context of the phrase. In Exp 2, the same Ss chose the most likely written English translation for auditory sentences of SMC. Global prosodic information was manipulated to create different levels of 'prosodic closeness' between 2 critical items in a tone sandhi environment, while the syntactic relation between these items was held constant. Ss relied on prosodic structure of the phrases to determine whether or not the TSR had applied, and to identify individual lexical items.

Abstract = {Examined how linguistic form and conceptual level might affect acquisition. In their linguistic form, labels can be single nouns (e.g., oak) or compound nouns (e.g., oak-tree). In conceptual level, categories can be structured at the basic (e.g., tree), superordinate (e.g., plant), or subordinate (e.g., oak) levels. Both of these factors were varied in 2 experiments, in which 133 children (aged 2 yrs 11 mo–5 yrs 11 mo) were taught novel lexical hierarchies. As predicted, compound nouns were easier to learn than single nouns, especially at the subordinate level. Age of S and category level influenced the kinds of errors Ss made. The most common error was to treat hierarchically related words as labeling mutually exclusive subsets (e.g., analogous to oak and elm) so that terms from different levels contrasted at the same level. Both factors, linguistic form and conceptual level, influenced Ss' learning of new lexical hierarchies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Forward priming was obtained in all conditions, while backward priming occurred only with lexical decision. In Exp 2, primes were presented auditorily, either in isolation or in a sentence. Targets followed the offset of the primes either immediately or after 200 ms. Backward priming occurred with both response tasks, but only when the prime was an isolated word. Backward priming decreased over time with the naming task, but not with lexical decision. These results suggest that the locus of the backward priming effect is different for the 2 response tasks.

Abstract = {Approaches to spoken word recognition differ in the importance they assign to word onsets during lexical access. This research contrasted the hypothesis that lexical access is strongly directional with the hypothesis that word onsets are less important than the overall goodness of fit between input and lexical form. A cross-modal priming technique was used to investigate the extent to which a rhyme prime (a prime that differs only in its first segment from the word that is semantically associated with the visual probe) is as effective a prime as the original word itself. Earlier research had shown that partial primes that matched from word onset were very effective cross-modal primes. The present results show that, irrespective of whether the rhyme prime was a real word or not, and irrespective of the amount of overlap between the rhyme prime and the original word, the rhymes are much less effective primes than the full word. In fact, no overall priming effect could be detected at all except under conditions in which the competitor environment was very sparse. This suggests that word onsets do have a special status in the lexical access of spoken words. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the common assumption that function words are often identified wholly or in part on the basis of outline shape and/or word-specific visual pattern. Three perceptual identification experiments were conducted as well as a speeded oral reading experiment and a lexical-decision task where the visual pattern of function words and control items (content words, nonwords and control strings) was systematically distorted by cAsE alTeRnAtIoN. In all 5 experiments (with a total of 94 undergraduates) distortion failed to impair performance more on functors than on various control items. This result is argued to be inconsistent with the view that outline shape and word-specific visual pattern typically play a role in the identification of isolated function words. Shape distortion impaired function words less than controls in perceptual identification, but impaired function and content words equally in speeded naming and lexical decision.

Abstract = {To eliminate potential 'backward' priming effects, S. Glucksberg et al (see record [rid]1986-29080-001[/rid]) introduced a variant of the cross-modal lexical priming task in which subjects made lexical decisions to nonword targets that were modeled on a word related to either the contextually biased or unbiased sense of an ambiguous word. Lexical decisions to nonwords were longer than controls only when the nonword was related to the contextually biased sense of the ambiguous word, leading Glucksberg et al to conclude that context does constrain lexical access and that the multiple access pattern observed in previous studies was probably an artifact of backward priming. We did not find nonword interference when the nonword targets used by Glucksberg et al were preceded by semantically related ambiguous or unambiguous word primes. However, we did replicate their sentence context results when the ambiguous words were removed from the sentences. We conclude that the interference obtained by Glucksberg et al is due to postlexical judgments of the congruence of the sentence context and the target, not to context constraining lexical access.

Ss performed a lexical decision task, deciding whether each letter-string was a word or not. Response times to 3 types of words (standard regular, common orthography but irregular spelling-to-sound relationships, and unusual orthography and irregular spelling-to-sound relationships) were compared. The performance of good readers but not of poor readers was impaired on the words that were phonologically irregular (compared with regular words). Results suggest that the regularity effect is phonologically and not orthographically mediated and that good readers use a predominantly phonological strategy in lexical decision.

Abstract = {Three experiments examined lexical and sentence-level contributions to contextual facilitation effects in word recognition. Subjects named target words preceded by normal or scrambled sentence contexts that contained lexical associates of the target. In Experiment 1, normal sentences showed facilitation for related targets and inhibition for unrelated targets. Experiment 2 eliminated syntactically anomalous targets among unrelated items and showed only facilitation for related targets. In neither experiment was there any effect of relatedness for scrambled stimuli. Experiment 3 included syntactically normal but semantically anomalous sentences to test whether the failure of scrambled sentences to show priming was due to their syntactic incoherence. Normal sentences again showed contextual facilitation, but neither scrambled nor anomalous sentences showed such effects. The results indicate that there are sentence-context effects that do not arise solely from intralexical spreading activation and suggest that context facilitates the identification of a lexical candidate.

Abstract = {Nairne, Pusen, and Widner (1985) described an experiment in which they found that, like nonwords, low-frequency words were no more likely to be recognized if they had been self-generated at study than if they had been read. These findings led Nairne et al. to conclude that generation effects depend on the extent to which words are associatively linked to other words in semantic memory, not on lexical representation per se. In a series of experiments designed to test the generality of Nairne et al.'s low-frequency finding, we found not only that generation effects occurred for low-frequency words but also that those effects were on the whole indistinguishable from effects obtained with high-frequency words. These findings indicate that word frequency does not define an essential boundary condition for generation effects and so provides no basis for preferring an associative hypothesis to a lexical one.

Abstract = {Individual talents in reading vary widely. For example, the average college student reads about 250 words per minute, but some read at twice that rate without a loss of comprehension and many read at half that rate with no gain in comprehension. Children just beginning to read--at about age six in the United states--also vary widely in reading ability, with many children not showing adequate progress in reading words. Somewhat later, their problems show up in comprehension as well. These reading ability differences are the focus of this paper. In order to deal with these differences, the author first considers the component processes of skilled reading in a general cognitive framework. At the most general level, these components are lexical access and comprehension. Lexical access is the 'recognition' of a word. It is access to the word in permanent memory given a printed graphic input. Comprehension is not a single process, but the result of a number of processes that the reader uses to produce understanding. An important link between lexical access and comprehension may be provided by implicit speech processes that occur as part of lexical access.

Abstract = {Eight mother–infant pairs were videotaped in 2 sessions when the infants were aged 38–45 and 65–73 wks. Analysis of relations between maternal speech and the contiguous nonverbal context revealed that the pattern of close correspondence between conversational topic and context, which had emerged at 9 mo, persisted at 16 mo, with the majority of changes in topic being in response to an action carried out by the child. A large proportion of maternal utterances continued to refer to objects and activities that were at the child's focus of attention; although, at 16 mo, mothers less often accompanied comments on the child's activity with supporting actions of their own. Findings are discussed in the light of studies of early lexical development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In Exp I, a sentence classification task was used to determine whether adults use comprehension strategies such as the actor-action-object strategy proposed by T. G. Bever (1970). 24 undergraduates were presented with a number of sentences and were asked to decide as quickly as possible whether or not the sentence made sense. Findings indicate that Ss tended to use Bever's actor-action-object strategy. Exp II examined the possibility that even the weak relations between the words of the sentences used in Exp I could lead to a substantial effect of lexical priming. Findings are consistent with those from Exp I, and overall results provide strong evidence for the presence of lexical priming effects during comprehension. By eliminating the possibility of Ss responding on the basis of decisions made at the sentential level, Exp II demonstrated that the facilitatory effect must have arisen from contextual factors operating at the lexical level.

Abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments during which 16 Japanese learners at an Australian university and 24 native Japanese readers made lexical classification to Hiragana or Katakana written Japanese words and foreign loan words. All Ss were undergraduate students. Results show a Stroop-like effect in the foreign loan word condition but not in the Japanese word condition among foreign Japanese learners, whereas a Stroop-like effect was shown in both Japanese and foreign loan word conditions among native Japanese readers. Based on these results, lexical representations of the native Japanese readers and foreign Japanese learners for the foreign loan words are discussed. Loan words refer to directly borrowed foreign words, such as the Japanese RA-JI-O for 'ratio.' 150 nonwords, half written in Hiragana and half in Katakana, were used as the stimuli for lexical decision.

Abstract = {The influence of an isolated word's meaning on lexical-decision RT was demonstrated through 4 experiments with 96 undergraduates. Ss in 2 experiments made lexical-decision judgments; those in Exp III pronounced the words used in the lexical-decision task; and those in Exp IV quickly pronounced their 1st associative response to the words. Differences in lexical access time for the words were measured with the pronunciation task, and differences in meaning were assessed with the association task. Multiple regression analyses of lexical-decision RT were conducted using associative RT, pronunciation RT, and other target word properties (printed frequency, length, instance dominance, and number of dictionary meanings) as predictor variables. These analyses revealed a relationship between lexical-decision RT and associative RT after the effects of other variables had been partialed out. Word frequency continued to have a significant relationship to lexical-decision RT beyond that shared with pronunciation RT and the other variables. Results indicate that at least some of the effect of word meaning and word frequency in lexical decision is attributable to a decision stage following lexical access.

Abstract = {Investigated the relationship of individual differences in early lexical development to differences in the way mothers and children regulate each other's attentional states. Six middle-class mother–child dyads served as Ss. All of the children were between 12 and 13 mo of age when the study began. Three were firstborn (2 males and 1 female), and 3 were later born (2 males and 1 female). None of the mothers worked, and none of the children attended daycare on a regular basis. The mothers kept diary records and were videotaped with their children at monthly intervals for 5 mo. Language measures from the diary were related to measures of attention manipulation and maintenance derived from a coding of the videotaped interactions. Results show that when mothers initiated interactions by directing their child's attention, rather than by following into it, their child learned fewer object labels and more personal-social words. Dyads who maintained sustained bouts of joint attentional focus had children with larger vocabularies overall. It is concluded that the way mothers and children regulate each other's attention is an important factor in children's early lexical development.

Abstract = {Investigated the contributions to semantic priming of 2 components of the semantic representation underlying a word: perceptually and conceptually based information. Perceptual information is based on physical attributes such as shape or color, while conceptual information consists of more abstract elements such as functional attributes. Whether both components would produce an effect in semantic priming was investigated in 2 studies with 56 undergraduates. Pairs of words either related because of a conceptual property (banana-apple), a perceptual property (ball-apple), or both because of a perceptual and conceptual property (cherry-apple) were presented as prime and target in a lexical decision and a word-naming task. Results show independent contributions of perceptual and conceptual attributes to semantic priming. Word recognition was not only influenced by the conceptual similarity to a preceding word but also by the correspondence with the preceding word with regard to perceptually based properties. The perceptual relatedness of the prime and target seemed to have its own independent effect on lexical processes. (30 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

P. A. Kolers (see record [rid]1976-29212-001[/rid]) showed that passages read 13–25 mo previously in transformed typography were reread faster than new passages.

Using a total of 46 adults (aged 18–32 yrs), the present experiments found no evidence for the retention of specific perceptual information after one week, although there was strong evidence for the retention of gist and for transfer of both a general pattern-analyzing skill and of specific lexical information.

Abstract = {Argues that natural conversations and popular television shows provide sufficient lexical diversity for children to develop novice levels of lexical expertise, but are ill-suited for developing the higher levels of such expertise due to distinct patterns of word choice in speaking and writing. Those patterns are revealed in a half-million word corpus, designed to represent all major language sources (i.e., print, TV, conversation). Comparisons of sample texts against a common 10,000-type reference lexicon permit comparisons between texts from different language sources. The pattern of word choice in most printed texts is described by a simple linear equation, but conversations are fit by cubic equations. Conversations between college graduates more closely resemble a preschool child's speech to its parents than texts from newspapers. Implications of linear and S-curved patterns for models of lexical acquisition are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

A PE was demonstrated that was attributable to the way in which lexical items were combined rather than to the properties of individual lexical items. The content words from the sentences used produced a similar reaction time (RT) difference in a task in which syntactic processing was disrupted. In another task less prone to task-specific strategies but sensitive to plausibility, the disruption of syntactic processing eliminated the PE. When lexical priming was eliminated, a PE still occurred. Findings suggest that the PE cannot be fully explained in terms of lexical priming.

Abstract = {Suggests a viable reconciliation between 2 explanations of the role of phoneme monitoring in the perception of spoken languge. The initial phoneme of a text item appears to be recognized more quickly in a real word than in a nonword; it is affected by the lexical status of the text item. However, other texts show no significant difference in speed of identification of the target phoneme in words and nonwords. This seeming contradiction can be reconciled by using the dual-code hypothesis, which postulates 2 simultaneous modes of recognition, one based on the elaboration of a phonetic or prelexical code and the other derived from elaboration of a phonological or lexical code.

Abstract = {Discusses lexical access procedures in bilingual individuals in terms of the functional mechanisms that enabled them to retrieve lexical information. The authors focus on the interaction of the facilitation and inhibition effects in bilingual Ss when identifying words in the language in which they occur. The authors conducted studies in which the presentation of a contextual word in an S's 2nd language influenced the identification of a test word in his/her 1st language. Two types of relationships, translation and semantic, were included. Results of manipulations of the formal relationships between the words of the 2 languages (bilingual word recognition, organization, and retrieval of alternative lexical codes) are discussed.

Abstract = {Reviews research concerned with processing words that have more than one meaning. Three principal models of ambiguity processing are outlined—context-dependent, ordered-access, and exhaustive access—and the research on which they are based is discussed. Findings seem best served by a hybrid model that allows for activation to accrue for all meanings, with the degree of activation sensitive to the frequency of the meanings and context. The major results of this field are interpreted in terms of the literature in word recognition. Such interpretation is important because of the guidance that such models may give to ambiguity research and because of the importance that ambiguous words hold for more general models of lexical access.

Abstract = {Varied the graphemic and phonetic properties shared by a word target and a following pseudoword mask, using 45 undergraduates in Exp I. Graphemic and homophonic masks, equated for number of letters shared with a word target, showed a masking reduction effect relative to a control mask. There was an additional effect of the homophonic mask over the graphemic mask, attributable to phonetic activation. A 2nd experiment with 24 Ss verified this pattern of mask reduction effects, using conditions that ruled out any explanation of the effect that did not take account of the target–mask relationship. Results suggest that a phonetic activation nonoptionally occurs (prelexically) during lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two experiments with 26 Ss investigated how acoustic-phonetic information is mapped onto the lexical level during lexical access and selection. The 1st experiment tested word identification across successive 25-msec gates of monosyllables contrasting in word-final voicing and showed a continuous uptake of durational cues. The 2nd experiment revealed strong effects at vowel closure on the choice between word candidates terminating in different places of articulation. Results suggest a contrast between symmetric and asymmetric decision processes, with phonological structure being the potential source of asymmetries in the lexical interpretation of acoustic cues.

There were 12 Ss at each of 5 age levels: 6–7, 9, 11–12, 14–25, and 26–56 yrs. Although comprehension for some idioms occurred in the youngest group, a literalization strategy appeared to be operating between the ages of 6 and 9 yrs. Idiomatic comprehension increased rapidly after 9 yrs of age, although comprehension of idiomatic meaning developed before the ability to verbally interpret idioms. The ability to interpret meaning idiomatically did not seem to interfere with Ss' ability to literalize. Findings are discussed in relation to the development of other forms of lexical competence.

Four normal-developing (aged 1 yr 5 mo to 1 yr 9 mo) and 4 language-impaired (aged 2 yrs 8 mo to 2 yrs 11 mo) children were classified as referential or expressive speakers on the basis of their lexical distribution. For both the normal and language-impaired Ss, linguistic features suggested in the literature as correlating to one or another language-learning style were found to exist in clusters consistent with the Ss' pattern of lexical distribution. In addition, analyses of videotaped samples coded for the focus and context of the normal and language-impaired Ss' play behaviors revealed object-based and social-interaction-based activities that were generally consistent with the Ss' lexical distribution.

Abstract = {Explored the issue of whether beginning readers proceed from print directly to meaning, as suggested by R. W. Barron and J. Baron (see record [rid]1974-32015-001[/rid]) or whether it is necessary for them to use phonological information in order to obtain access to the meaning of printed words. 210 Dutch 7–12 yr olds were asked to make semantic interpretations from printed words in 5 experiments. It was hypothesized that if beginning readers make use of an intermediate phonemic code in accessing the lexicon, speech sounds will affect decision times. For this reason, speech sounds were presented shortly before a visual word display. Exps I and II explored the effects of concurrent vocalization; Exp III attempted to eliminate some of the alternative explanations of the effects of sound presentation; in Exps IV and V, 2 explanations of the diminishing effects of sound with increased reading skill were evaluated: an increase in direct recognition routines or an automatization of indirect access procedures. Results show that similarity between sound and the pronunciation of the word is facilitative for beginning readers (both for familiar and unfamiliar orthographies and independent of orthographic complexity) but has no effect for more fluent readers. It is concluded that at least at low levels of reading skill, intermediate phonemic codes are used in lexical access. (35 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studied how 48 children (aged 6 yrs 11 mo–9 yrs 3 mo) interpreted common adjectives used in the structure 'John is easy/eager to please' over a period of 1 yr. Earlier studies of the acquisition of adult comprehension of this structure have revealed 3 stages of acquisition. Two types of learning appear to be involved—the 1st being the awareness that this linguistic frame has 2 differing interpretations, and the 2nd being the learning of the particular lexical items (e.g., 'eager' and 'easy') that indicate which of those abstract representations is to be recovered to interpret a particular instance of use. The processes occurring during the 2nd type of acquisition by the Ss were the focus of the present study. Results, while showing a slight but significant decrease in errors, gave evidence of great inconsistency on the various lexical items by each individual S. It appears that a simple notion of gradual acquisition is inadequate and that some kind of reorganizational process must be hypothesized during lexical acquisition.

There were 6 types of items classified according to the gap incidence of morphological structure and/or stress distribution. Results agree with a previous lexical decision experiment by the author showing that gap location did not affect naming RTs. These findings do not support M.

Analysis of the data from both of the author's experiments shows a significant interaction of task and word class (i.e., words with initial stress were easier to name than words with noninitial stress, but this effect was not apparent in the lexical decision times). Results are interpreted in relation to the articulatory programs that are assembled from lexical representations. (18 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Evaluated lexical innovation (the creation of a word by combining existing morphemes in a novel way) as a method for circumventing word-finding difficulty in Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia. 10 Broca's and 9 Wernicke's aphasics (mean ages 49 and 50 yrs, respectively) were matched for naming performance and compared to a control group of normal adults matched for age and education. Lexical innovations were collected during the administration of a confrontation naming test, and were analyzed in terms of the correctness of morpheme combination, semantic accuracy, novelty, and communicative effectiveness. An innovation was considered to be communicatively effective when its intended referent was understood by a naive judge. The lexical innovations of the 2 aphasic groups were diametrically opposed: Compared to both Broca's aphasics and normal adults, Wernicke's aphasics innovated significantly less often, and their innovations were significantly inferior in terms of semantic precision, the proper construction of morpheme combination, and communicative effectiveness. This pattern suggests that lack of verbal fluency may be compatible with lexical creativity, while empty logorrheic speech may be an impediment to lexical creativity.

Abstract = {Four adolescent social group lexes (SGLs) from the Illawarra region of New South Wales are characterized using measures of meanings available to individuals in passive or active vocabularies. The 4 SGLs are contrasted with a 5th SGL from Sydney. The nature of social group lexis and its measurement are discussed. The lexico-semantic weaknesses (relevant to the register of the secondary school) of the Wollongong poorer working-class SGL are linked with the educational failure of its users; the relative strengths of immigrant-descent Wollongong SGLs are linked with the relative educational success of their users. The influence of extralinguistic context on lexical selection is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Recorded electrophysiological activity at 16 scalp locations during a word recognition task in order to investigate the effect of expectancy factors on event-related potentials (ERPs). Ss were 16 undergraduates. In each of 160 trials, 2 stimuli (S1 and S2) were presented with a stimulus onset asynchrony of 1,500 msec under 4 experimental conditions. The ERP difference between the 4 conditions following S2 was interpreted in terms of a negative-going potential that appeared prior to the P300, during a time period which started 200 msec and ended 550 msec from stimulus onset. The negativity related to nonwords was significantly larger than the negativity related to words. The negativity related to the expected antonym was almost nonexistent. It is speculated that this negativity has the same origin as N400, and that it might be related to the process of lexical access. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Contends that dominant models of auditory word recognition emphasize the lexical access component of the word identification problem and thus cast the recognition process as a simple operation matching the input against stored lexical representations or direct activation of those representations. However, a view that the grammar of a listener's native language aids in the perception of that language as well as other unfamilar ones suggests an alternative approach to the lexical access/word recognition problem. The role that grammar plays in auditory word recognition centers on 2 key aspects, the grammatical information useful in lexical access and the systems that exploit this information. The contribution of phonological information and the role of word and phrase syntax are considered, and issues involved in selecting lexical forms appropriate to context are discussed, with emphasis on the distinction between information useful for lexical form vs lexical access.

There were no significant differences in the initial rate of learning among the 3 conditions. Overlap training, however, provided more extensive generalization to untrained items than did nonoverlap training. An analysis of errors revealed that object words were produced correctly more often than modifiers, regardless of syntax and training condition. It is suggested that careful selection of training items and frequent monitoring of generalization can enhance the efficiency of intervention programs focusing on lexical and syntactic development.

Abstract = {Investigated the modulation of event-related potentials (ERPs) by semantic priming and item repetition, with 12 Ss in Exp I and 10 Ss in Exp II. In Exp I, Ss silently counted occasional nonwords against a background of words, a proportion of which were either semantic associates or repetitions of a preceding word. ERPs to repeated words were distinguished by an early negative-going deflection and a later sustained positive-going shift. Semantically primed words showed a limited positive-going modulation. In Exp II, ERPs to repetitions showed an early ERP modulation similar to that in Exp I and also displayed a later slow positive shift. It is concluded that the effects of repetition differ as a consequence of whether, prior to their 1st presentation, items possess a representation in lexical memory.

Abstract = {Investigated the role of the mental lexicon in phonemic restoration--an auditory illusion in which listeners hear a part of a word that has been replaced by another sound. Two experiments explored whether the strength of the illusion is affected by whether a single lexical item could be restored. Exp I tested the sensitivity of 40 females (aged approximately 20-50 yrs) to the lexical uniqueness of items and availability of alternates. More perceptual restoration was found for multiply-restorable stimuli (e.g., 'egion' → 'legion' or 'region') than for lexically uniques ones (e.g., '_esion' → 'lesion'). Exp II examined lexical uniqueness over time, using 36 college students and college graduates. Words became lexically unique when enough had been heard to eliminate all alternatives. This affected the strength of the illusion. Results complement those of other techniques, indicating an active role for lexical representations of speech perception.

ESL Ss showed significantly poorer C performance than did NES Ss. The reading C difference between the groups was smaller than the listening difference. A decoding task with primarily lower level encoding processes showed no intergroup differences in decoding and comparison processes. NES Ss outperformed ESL Ss on vocabulary tasks, although ESL Ss were familiar with most words. Vocabulary knowledge (VK) did not insure C for the ESL Ss; mechanisms other than VK caused C differences between groups. Efficiency of processing may explain C differences between ESL and NES Ss: ESLs may have difficulty in constructing higher level meanings from incoming lexical items.

Abstract = {Examined the effects of word orientation and word imageability in a visual half-field procedure in 2 experiments with 64 right-handed university students. The studies involved a lexical decision task in which items were presented in either a horizontal or vertical orientation randomly intermixed in Exp I and blocked in Exp II. Overall, a right-visual-field advantage resulted with horizontal items, yet no visual-field asymmetries were found with the vertical items. These results indicate that altering the orientation affects visual-field superiority. It is proposed that the novelty of vertical displays leads to greater involvement of the right hemisphere. Imageability was related to performance only for horizontal displays, but there were no significant differences in imageability effects between the 2 visual fields. It is concluded that word imageability has little effect on visual-field differences, at least not for lexical decisions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Demonstrated in 3 experiments, using 96 Ss, that the size of the sentence context effect was influenced by the validity of the contextual information in a naming task. A similar result was obtained by changing the proportion of validly completed sentences in the practice session without altering the composition of the experimental trials themselves. The manipulation of context validity had its effect largely on the facilitatory component of the context effect, which was not dependent on the particular baseline condition employed. This dissociation of facilitation and inhibition is considered contrary to the predictions of attentional accounts of priming but in line with an explanation of context effects developed by the present author (see record [rid]1987-20990-001[/rid]) primarily to resolve lexical and perceptual ambiguity.

Abstract = {A model of speech segmentation in a stress language is proposed, according to which the occurrence of a strong syllable triggers segmentation of the speech signal, whereas occurrence of a weak syllable does not trigger segmentation. We report experiments in which listeners detected words embedded in nonsense bisyllables more slowly when the bisyllable had two strong syllables than when it had a strong and a weak syllable; mint was detected more slowly in mintayve than in mintesh. According to our proposed model, this result is an effect of segmentation: When the second syllable is strong, it is segmented from the first syllable, and successful detection of the embedded word therefore requires assembly of speech material across a segmentation position. Speech recognition models involving phonemic or syllabic recoding, or based on strictly left-to-right processes, do not predict this result. It is argued that segmentation at strong syllables in continuous speech recognition serves the purpose of detecting the most efficient locations at which to initiate lexical access.

Another finding has been that words that are more difficult to recognize in isolation display larger SCEs than easier words. The present experiments with 384 undergraduates showed SCEs to be robust and eliminated several alternative explanations. Two experiments demonstrated the appropriateness of the neutral condition used to assess facilitation and inhibition. Another showed that SCEs did not depend on the procedure used. It was shown that manipulations that were designed to affect S strategies did not change the pattern of results. In 3 experiments, an interaction between stimulus quality and content condition was obtained. The interaction replicated across 2 forms of stimulus degradation, but only 1 form increased inhibition effects as well as facilitation effects. Other inconsistencies between previous SC experiments in the magnitude of the inhibition effects observed were resolved by showing that an SC produced more inhibition in the lexical decision task than in the naming task. It was demonstrated that the 2 tasks produced different amounts of inhibition when the same stimuli were used. Sentence integration processes that occurred after lexical access appeared to be responsible for some of the inhibition observed in lexical decision tasks.

Abstract = {Theories of visual word recognition have proposed that a word's phonological properties can be involved in reading visually presented words. It is commonly supposed that this phonological information can be arrived at in at least 2 ways: by looking it up after identifying the word visually (a lexical route) or by rule-governed translating of the word's orthographic code (a nonlexical route). Four experiments were conducted with 96 college students to examine whether phonological information is automatically accessed in visual word recognition, and if so, how this occurs. A priming technique was used with a display sequence of mask, prime, target, mask. Ss were asked to make written responses to any words that they thought were present, and prime identification was minimal. A facilitatory effect of phonological priming on target identification occurred when primes were homophones of targets. However, no similar identification occurred when the prime was a nonword homophone of the target. The homophone priming effect was found irrespective of whether targets followed the spelling-to-sound rules of English. Results suggest that automatic access to phonology can occur in visual recognition and that it operates by means of a lexical route.

Abstract = {Administered the Comprehension Test of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests and a deductive reasoning test to 720 students in Grades 5–8. Each item on the deductive reasoning test consisted of a prose passage containing the premises of a basic logical rule and a question that required Ss to evaluate a conclusion drawn from these premises. Ss' scores on the deductive reasoning test were analyzed according to grade level, level of reading comprehension, and type of logical rule. Developmental gains in deductive reasoning abilities were limited to Ss with high reading comprehension, and interesting variations were found in the order of dominance of the logical rules at each grade level and for each reading comprehension group. These variations may reflect developmental changes in grammatical and lexical skills. (28 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Modal auxiliaries have an epistemic and deontic sense and range in strength, e.g., must propositions are stronger than may propositions. In the present study, 54 3.0–6.6 yr olds heard 2 contradictory modal propositions of varying strength. In the epistemic condition, the propositions concerned the location of a peanut. In the deontic condition, they were commands by 2 teachers about what room a puppet should go to. The S was to indicate which command should be followed. The general acquisitional rule was that the greater the difference in the strength of the 2 modal propositions, the earlier the difference was appreciated. Since the acquisitional history was similar across conditions, it is suggested that the 2 senses probably arose from a single lexical entry.

Abstract = {Examined the regularity effect in single-word pronunciation and lexical decision tasks in 3 experiments. Exp I, with 18 university students, compared pronunciation latencies for exception words based on unfamiliar and common letter patterns. It was found that both types of exceptions produced longer latencies than regular words. Exp II, with 8 Ss, employed a more objective basis for matching exception and regular words for letter pattern familiarity. Exception words still produced significantly longer pronunciation latencies than regular words. Data show that the regularity effect in pronunciation cannot be attributed to uncontrolled visual differences between exception and regular words. Exp III, with 20 Ss, demonstrated that Exp II material did not produce a regularity effect in lexical decision. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Manipulated normative word-frequency in a lexical-decision task with 22 62–82 yr old older persons and 21 17–28 yr old younger persons. Three methods of comparing processing time in the lexical access stage across age groups were evaluated: subtraction, analysis of covariance, and additive factor. The adequacy of the subtraction method was questioned because of the difficulty of finding a control task identical to the experimental task in all processing stages except lexical access. Analysis of covariance was inconclusive in this type of application because of the correlation between the covariate and the independent variable: age. The additive-factor method was a viable alternative to these 2 analyses. Within this framework, the lack of an interaction between age and word-frequency indicated that the factors affected different stages of processing. Since word-frequency has been shown to affect the lexical access stage, the present result suggests that aging does not affect speed of lexical access.

Abstract = {In the present study with 25 members of an applied psychology unit in England, a mixed list of words and nonwords, presented singly for pronunciation, and phonologically ambiguous nonwords (nouch) were preceded critically by words with the same ambiguous segments, either pronounced regularly (couch) or irregulary (touch). Standard (and revised) dual-process theory predicts that preceding words will not affect pronunciation of nonwords; analogy theory predicts that they will. Significant biasing effects, compared to control conditions, support analogy theory, but a further modification to dual-process theory enables it to deal with these results. However, the presence in critical nonwords of morphemes pronounced consistently or inconsistently with the biased pronunciations significantly affected biasing; this makes the case for lexical analogy theory even stronger. Formal knowledge (descriptive spelling–sound rules) may be used consciously but does not reflect tacit processes in oral reading, which are better described by a single-process lexical analogy model.

Abstract = {Administered 2 nonverbal tasks of classificatory activity class inclusion and class intersection to 46 aphasics, 28 normal controls, 19 nonaphasic left-hemisphere-damaged, and 17 right-hemisphere-damaged patients to study (a) if aphasic patients were more impaired than nonaphasic brain-damaged patients on these 2 tasks of elementary logic and (b) if a relationship existed within the aphasic patients between inability to perform the tasks of classificatory activity and impairment of the semantic-lexical level of integration of language. Results are, for the most part, in line with expectations: Aphasics scored worse than normal controls and nonaphasic brain-damaged patients (even if the difference reached the level of significance only on the test of class intersection). Within the aphasic patients the worst results were obtained by Ss presenting clear signs of semantic-lexical disintegration. Findings support the assumption of a strong relationship between classificatory activities and semantic-lexical disturbances. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the effects of articulatory suppression on reading numbers written alphabetically or as Arabic numerals. For alphabetic numbers, but not for numerals, a phonological representation can be generated and used for lexical access. If such phonological encoding occurs, and if it is harmed by irrelevant articulatory activity, then articulatory suppression should have a greater effect on the reading of alphabetic than on numeral representations of numbers. In contrast to a finding reported by R. W. Barron (see record [rid]1978-12015-001[/rid]) involving alphabetic and Roman numerals, in 2 experiments (28 adults; 20 children, mean age 9.6 yrs) suppression was found to have essentially equivalent effects on the reading of both types of numbers. A 3rd experiment (15 adults) explored a possible explanation for these discrepant findings. It is concluded that although alphabetic and numeral representations of numbers may be processed differently, there is no evidence to support the idea that reading alphabetic numbers involves phonological encoding prior to lexical access.

Abstract = {In a previous study by the 1st 2 authors (see record [rid]1981-31922-001[/rid]), it was demonstrated that listeners were highly successful in identifying the intended meaning of spoken ditropic sentences (those that may carry either a literal or an idiomatic meaning) when speakers were instructed to convey distinction. The present study with 2 male speakers used acoustic and phonetic analyses carried out with the goal of identifying cues that distinguished the literal and idiomatic utterances. Certain prosodic differences were observed. Literal utterances were systematically longer than idioms. This was partly due to increased use of pauses, as well as to increased duration of major lexical items. Moreover, literal sentences were typically characterized by greater numbers of pitch contours (discernible rise–fall excursions of fundamental frequency) and open junctures than were idiomatic utterances. In addition to suprasegmental contrasts, articulatory distinctions were observed. These distinctions directly reflect the structural differences intrinsic to the 2 types of utterances. A literal sentence is formulated by the organization of constituent words and phrases. Idioms are holistic units, largely nontransparent to syntactic structure or the usual meaning of the lexical members. (27 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Exp I, the predictability of congruous word stimuli and their frequency of occurrence in printed English were varied. These 2 factors had independent and additive effects on decision latencies. Stimulus quality, word frequency, and semantic congruity (i.e., congruous vs incongruous) between the context and the stimulus were varied in Exp II. The effects of semantic congruity and word frequency on decision latencies combined additively, as did the effects of semantic congruity and stimulus quality.

Abstract = {Hemisphere differences in lexical processing may be due to asymmetry in the organization of lexical information, in procedures used to access the lexicon, or both. Six lateralized, lexical-decision experiments with 30 right-handed undergraduates employed various types of priming to distinguish among these possibilities. In 3 controlled (high probability) priming experiments, prime words could be used as lexical access clues. Larger priming was obtained for orthographically similar stimuli (e.g., beak–bear) when presented to the left visual field (LVF). Controlled priming based on phonological relatedness (e.g., juice–moose) was equally effective in either visual field. Semantic similarity (e.g., inch–yard) produced larger priming for right visual field (RVF) stimuli. Results suggest that the hemispheres may utilize different information to achieve lexical access. Spread of activation through the lexicon was measured in 3 complementary, automatic (low probability) priming experiments. Priming was restricted to LVF stimuli for orthographically similar words, while priming for phonologically related stimuli was only obtained in the RVF. Automatic semantic priming was present bilaterally but was larger in the LVF. Results imply hemisphere differences in lexical organization, with orthographic and semantic relationships available to the right hemisphere and phonological and semantic relations available to the left hemisphere. Findings support the notion of hemisphere asymmetries in both lexical organization and directed lexical processing. (50 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined K. I. Forster and S. M. Chambers's (see record [rid]1974-26697-001[/rid]) proposal that making lexical decisions to words and naming words access the same representations of those words in the mental lexicon. Five experiments with 74 college students revealed that the correlation between stimuli over tasks was due to word length in letters rather than to word frequency. In the experiment with orthographically illegal nonwords and orthographically legal but unwordlike nonwords, results show that lexical decisions were not influenced by word length but were influenced by word frequency. The letter length effect was due to a postaccess spelling check; and blocked naming, of words only, produced results similar to lexical decision, without length effects but with frequency effects indicative of lexical access. It is concluded that 2 separate and independent routes to word naming exist, both of which are mediated by lexical knowledge. (43 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Two experiments studied individual differences among normal adults in performance on the Nelson-Denny reading test to cast light on the processes involved in reading. Exp I (51 Ss aged 18–60 yrs) correlated reading comprehension with performance on the Daneman and Carpenter working memory span test, vocabulary, lexical decision with both homophonous and nonhomophonous nonwords, and a letter matching task, based on both physical and name matching. Working memory span proved to be a significant predictor, as did lexical decision with nonhomophonous nonwords, letter name matching, and vocabulary; and a derived measure indicating degree of phonological coding in lexical decision was only weakly correlated with comprehension, while the physical name match difference on the letter matching task was uncorrelated with reading performance. A 2nd experiment (66 female and 41 male Ss aged 19–60 yrs) explored further the working memory span task, comparing it with a nonlinguistic span test devised by R. D. Case et al (see record [rid]1982-25522-001[/rid]) based on memory and counting. While the verbal working memory measure again correlated significantly with comprehension, the counting measure was much more weakly related, and as in Exp I, vocabulary also correlated significantly with comprehension. It is concluded that reading comprehension depends on a number of separable components including vocabulary, working memory, and a general lexical access process.

Abstract = {Four experiments, with 232 undergraduates, examined whether Ss could utilize subtle acoustical cues in reconstructing words that were missing from the speech signal. Preliminary tests revealed that Ss could make use of semantic context in such reconstruction, analogous to earlier results in reading. In Exp I, Ss were able to use intonational cues at the beginning of a string to detect whether or not a sentence-initial word had been missing. In Exps II and III, Ss utilized coarticulatory cues for palatalization in sentence-internal locations to guide their lexical selection of reconstructed words. In Exp IV, Ss were influenced in lexical selection by the duration of a silent interval that had replaced the missing word. Results indicate that listeners can utilize the acoustical fine structure of speech to both detect the occurrence of a missing word and guide its lexical reconstruction.

Abstract = {Four experiments with 205 undergraduate Ss examined repetition priming among morphologically related words as a tool to study lexical organization. Exp I replicated a finding by R. F. Stanners et al (see record [rid]1981-00486-001[/rid]) that whereas inflected words prime their unaffixed morphological relatives as effectively as do the unaffixed forms themselves, derived words are effective, but weaker, primes. The experiment also suggested, however, that this difference in priming may have an episodic origin relating to the less formal similarity of derived than of inflected words to unaffixed morphological relatives. Exp II reduced episodic contributions to priming and found equally effective priming of unaffixed words by themselves, by inflected relatives, and by derived relatives. Exps III and IV found strong priming among relatives sharing the spelling and pronunciation of the unaffixed stem morpheme, sharing spelling alone, or sharing neither formal property exactly. Overall, results with auditory and visual presentations were similar. Interpretations that repetition priming reflects either repeated access to a common lexical entry or associative semantic priming are both rejected in favor of a lexical organization in which components of a word (e.g., a stem morpheme) may be shared among distinct words without the words themselves, in any sense, sharing a 'lexical entry.'

It also attempted to determine the relative importance of the 2 variables in causing delay, in the form of hesitation, in the production of spontaneous speech. Analysis revealed that content words of low contextual probability tended to be more infrequent than other words, and that both contextual probability and word frequency were associated with hesitation in speech. Contextual probability had an effect on hesitation even when word frequency was held constant, but word frequency had no effect when contextual probability was controlled. Analysis of certain types of errors revealed that word frequency may play an important role in the lexical selection process. (33 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Proposes a lexical access from spectra (LAFS) model that combines expected phonological and acoustic-phonetic properties of English word sequences into a simple spectral-sequence decoding network structure. Phonetic segments and phonological rules play an important role in network compilation, but not in the direct analysis of the speech waveform during lexical search.

Abstract = {In 3 experiments, 48 undergraduates responded faster to words with regular spelling-to-sound correspondences than to words with irregular correspondences in both a naming task and a lexical decision task. The locus of the small, but significant, regularity effect was also investigated. When Ss were forced to respond faster than usual via a response-deadline technique, no regularity effect was apparent in either their reaction times or error rates. No Regularity by Stimulus Quality interaction was obtained. It is concluded that the phonological recoding implied by the existence of the regulatory effect takes place subsequent to lexical access.

Abstract = {The mnemonic value of spellings in a paired-associate sound learning task was examined in 4 experiments. 120 1st and 2nd graders were taught 4 CVC nonsense sounds as oral responses. The stimuli were geometric figures or numbers of alphabet letters corresponding to initial consonant sounds. Various types of adjunct aids or activities occurred during study and feedback periods as the learning trials progressed. Visual spellings or misspellings of the CVC sounds were shown, or Ss imagined visual spellings, or they listened to oral spellings or to sounds broken into phonetic segments, or they rehearsed the sounds. Spellings were not present during test trials when sounds were recalled. In all experiments, sound learning was fastest when correct spellings were seen or imagined. The preferred interpretation is that spellings are effective because they provide readers with orthographic images useful for symbolizing and storing sounds in memory. Spelling-aided sound learning scores were highly correlated with Ss' knowledge of printed words, indicating that this representational process may be used by beginning readers to store printed words in lexical memory.

Abstract = {A variety of experimental findings have indicated that a system of precategorical acoustic storage is responsible for the recency effect obtained in the immediate serial recall of sequences of digits, consonants, or syllables. This study investigated whether such findings could be generalized to the recall of sequences of words by 16 undergraduates. Exp I showed that phonemic similarity among a sequence of words failed to reduce the modality effect or the recency effect. Exp II demonstrated that this finding was not attributable to a failure to control the phonemic properties of the stimulus material. Exp III showed that the stimulus suffix effect obtained with sequences of words was not affected by the acoustic similarity between the list items and the stimulus suffix. Exp IV demonstrated that phonemic similarity among a sequence of words failed to reduce the stimulus suffix effect. Results are explained by extending the original model of short-term memory to incorporate a system of postcategorical lexical storage.

Abstract = {Following C. A. Ferguson and C. G. Farwell (1975), the present paper examines phonological development in lexical terms and extends their method to consideration of syllables within words. Ferguson and Farwell dealt with word-initial consonants only; the attempt is made here to determine whether the sets of phone classes in all positions are the same, whether differences that occur from position to position are primarily within the phone class or in the number and distribution of phone classes at each level in the tree, and what effect position in the syllable has on phone classes. Research was directed toward a solution to the problem of how children acquire a sound system: whether they follow 'universal' orders of acquisition (R. Jakobson, 1942) or whether they develop distinct 'strategies' that they may utilize to varying degrees. The 4 children in this study did not all follow the same order of phonological acquisition and among the 4 Ss, at least 3 different strategies were observable. These strategies are examined in detail and discussed with respect to the lexical parameter. (7 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The question of whether or not lexical information is accessed directly from a visual code or by a process of phonetic mediation was investigated in 3 lexical decision experiments using 48 college students in each. Phonetic similarity influenced decisions about visually presented words only when they were to be discriminated for orthographically regular nonwords. When consonant strings or random letter strings were used as nonwords, phonetic similarity effects were absent, and graphemic similarity exerted a powerful effect while evidence of semantic priming was found. This pattern is interpreted as evidence of direct lexical access, which is probably the normal processing mode for skilled readers. Phonetic coding, when it occurs, may be a storage strategy rather than a part of the addressing chain for lexical structures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {To study the notion of stage processing independence in reading, children were given a pronunciation task to measure the decoding process and a controlled association task to measure semantic processing. Errors on each task were analyzed in terms of word properties, pretask familiarization, and grade. Word frequency and, to a lesser extent, word concreteness affected both tasks, while letter variables only made a difference in decoding. Vowel complexity hampered decoding only when words were uncommon. Prefamiliarizations did not have global effects but were specific to the kind of task. Results suggest that, at the word level, decoding is dependent on letter properties as well as familiarity of whole words. The semantic process appeared to be affected by lexical accessibility.

Abstract = {Attempted to determine whether mechanically generated sentences, often referred to in the literature as 'anomalous,' are in fact anomalous. A total of 40 undergraduates in 2 experiments were asked to do 2 different tasks: a paired-associates learning task involving anomalous sentences as responses, and a 2nd task involving interpretation of such sentences. Results of the interpretation task show that a large proportion of Ss were able to give interpretations for anomalous sentences; learning results indicate that anomalous sentences were more difficult to anticipate than natural sentences only when task order was Learn first, Interpret second. In the order Interpret-Learn, differences in ease of learning between anomalous and naturally occurring sentences did not appear. Results indicate that anomalous sentences are interpretable, that a range of difficulty for such sentences can be established, that anomalous sentences are learned as easily as naturally occurring ones after interpretation, and that many of the interpretations given to such sentences are metaphoric in character. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for models of lexical organization. (23 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Mean phrase structure depth (d), based on the Yngve syntactic model, and lexical density (LD) were varied in a 2 × 2 within-subjects design, with List adding a between-subjects variable. The main results were that recall probability of individually presented sentences was not related to d, but was inversely related to LD, the proportion of lexical, as opposed to grammatical, words in the sentence. These results were replicated with a third list. The fact that d was unrelated to retention casts further doubt on the general value of the Yngve hypothesis, at least as presently interpreted and approximated by the d measure. Alternative interpretations of the model are briefly discussed. Finally, explanation of the LD effect is discussed in terms of lexical uncertainty and underlying relations.

It is suggested that lexical representations will account for the recall differences observed in single items. However, the relation between syntactic complexity and lexical representation is still unresolved. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the influence of lexical frequency  preliminary hesitation (latency) in single-word stimulus presentation. 20 male undergraduates were presented 10 high- and 10 low-frequency nouns selected from  the Thorndike-Lorge list and instructed to  compose sentences containing the stimulus words. Preliminary hesitation was defined as the interval between the presentation of the stimulus word and the 1st sound uttered by the S, exclusive of repetitions of the stimulus word. Failure to obtain a significant difference between results for the high- and low-frequency series supported the hypothesis that lexical frequency is not a sufficient condition to account for preliminary hesitation (latency) in single stimulus-word presentations. These findings suggest lexical frequency and familiarity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Psychologists can read, or better browse, through this book with profit, it is full of wise comments on the human condition as well as broader philosophical insights. The analytic dogma that any word or proposition that can be spoken is likely to contain insights into the human condition frequently leads the author astray, but even these exercises in lexical exegesis are sometimes instructive.

Abstract = {Investigated the hypothesis that, for adult native speakers, increasing syntactic complexity would lead to increased salience of phonological properties of words; whether syntactic simplicity would lead to a greater salience of semantic properties of words was also studied. 72 adult native speakers of English were required to name a word presented after a context sentence. Syntactic complexity of the context sentence was varied; the word to be named was phonologically or semantically related or unrelated to the last word in the sentence. The time interval between the end of the context sentence and the word to be named was also varied (0, 50, or 200 msec). Data provide no support for the hypothesis that complex syntax leads to increased salience of phonological properties of words, as there was no substantial or consistent increase in RTs in the complex as opposed to the easy syntax conditions. Data suggest, however, that there is some interplay between lexical accessing and syntactic processing: There was a tendency for the frequency of the word to be named to correlate with naming time in the complex conditions (i.e., less frequent words were named more slowly). It was also found that salience of activated words was maintained under complexity conditions as the time for sentence processing was increased. It is suggested that these trends can be integrated into a processing model that contains autonomous subunits for syntactic processing and lexical access.
