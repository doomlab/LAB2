Abstract = {We integrate recent findings from the linguistics literature with the organizational justice literature to examine how the language used to encode justice violations influences fairness perceptions. The study focused on the use of non-agentive syntax to encode mistakes in Spanish ('The vase was broken') versus using agentive syntax in English ('She broke the vase') influences event fairness perceptions. We hypothesized that when justice violations are encoded using Spanish, because the non-agentive syntax makes the responsible party less salient, the event would be perceived as less unfair. In Study 1 (n = 111), English-speaking participants rated the fairness of an event in which a mistake was made and an employee received a negative outcome. They rated it as more unfair (p < .01, η² = .06) when the scenario was presented in agentive syntax. Experiment 2 (n = 70) used native English- and Spanish-speakers who watched a video of manager making a mistake. We found that Spanish-speakers used less agentive syntax (p < .01, η² = .21), perceived the event as less unfair (p < .001, η² = .23), and were more willing to help the manager who made the mistake. In Experiment 3 (n = 101) we replicated this effect controlling for cross-cultural differences and native language; further, we found an interaction between entity fairness (event vs. entity) and native language (Spanish vs. English) on citizenship intentions (p < .01, η² = .08). These results extend our understanding of how language may influence relevant workplace attitudes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In our paper, we take a constructivist approach to early forms of ‘academic language’, based on a conversation analytic framework. Adopting an interactional linguistic framework that is based on ethnomethodological and conversation analytic theoretical thinking, we aim to describe the social and linguistic norms that emerge in so-called ‘morning circles’, a highly ritualised interactional routine that transfers part of the interactional responsibility to the children and at the same time teaches the prerequisites for specific communicative practices. As morning circles are turned into language teaching lessons on a regular basis, we describe the linguistic features that emerge as learning objects, and some of the learning practices in which they are embedded. We will argue that language learning practices are situated practices, connecting the use of linguistic forms with ideologies of linguistic and social appropriateness. Our analysis is based on video recordings of three sessions in a first grade class in a primary school in a medium sized town in Germany, which have been transcribed and qualitatively analysed.

Abstract = {The authors documented a linguistic norm account of direction of comparison asymmetry effects in relational judgments (e.g., seeing hyenas as more similar to dogs than dogs are similar to hyenas). The asymmetry effect is magnified by discrepancies in prominence between subject and reference, and has previously been explained using A. Tversky's (1977) feature-matching model. Given a linguistic norm to place more prominent objects in the referent position, violation of this norm might reduce sentence clarity, which then weakens the magnitude of subsequent relational judgments. 53 undergraduates completed a study that tested the degree to which both clarity and feature-matching predicted the magnitude of relational judgments by construction in 3 regression models, on for each of the 3 types of relation statements: similarity, difference, and spatial relation. Clarity perceptions predict the magnitude of relational judgments independently of the cognitive manipulation of the features of the compared objects. The pattern of findings suggests that a linguistic norm interpretation may account for variance in relational judgments independently of Tversky's feature-matching model.

Abstract = {This paper addresses the issues with current systems of categorisation and measurement of linguistic metaphoricity, which have coloured most research into the area to-date. The paper discusses the role of metaphor as a form of creative language and a deviation from more linguistic norms and conventionalities. Two current theories are discussed as providing alternatives to metaphor identification approaches. These are Hanks’ (Int J Lexicogr 17:3, 2004) Theory of Norms and Exploitations and Hoey’s (Lexical priming and the properties of text, 2003) Theory of Lexical Priming. It is proposed that the theory of lexical priming can be adopted to provide an explanation of linguistic norms and exploitations involved in metaphoric language. Finally, the paper provides a brief corpus analysis of the verb to kindle found in a corpus of Nineteenth Century writings. The analysis will focus upon evidence of linguistic and secondary meaning primings within concordance lines. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This study examines how preadolescent African American students in Washington, D.C., used a linguistic practice called ‘joning,’ a style of verbal play similar to ritual insults, in peer interactions. Sociolinguists have focused on how children socialize each other into vernacular styles appropriate for peer group use but often assume that they disalign with social and linguistic norms for classroom behavior. Drawing from a nine-month ethnographic study that the author conducted in an after-school program, this article analyzes the structure and function of joning as a vernacular style of African American Vernacular English and its uses in constructing classroom identities. Joning often facilitated student learning, but it was perceived as a socially and physically risky linguistic practice because of its uses as conflict talk in the local community. Focusing on preadolescence as a key stage of language socialization, this article shows how minority students modify peer-learned linguistic practices to pursue academic success on their own terms.

Abstract = {Since the late 1800s, the Uruguayan Government has attempted to enforce cultural and linguistic norms along the border with Brazil through the prohibition of Portuguese, especially in schools, despite the fact that this is the heritage language of most border residents. This research focuses on the differential use of Spanish and Portuguese in Rivera, the largest city on the border. Using self-reported data and metalinguistic commentaries extracted from interviews with 63 Spanish–Portuguese bilinguals, the use of both languages in various domains (home, school, work spaces) and with diverse interlocutors (family, friends, co-workers, superiors) is analyzed. Quantitative and qualitative analysis reveals that Portuguese, which has been marginalized for decades, is more frequently used in the home with relatives and close friends. The use of Portuguese in more formal domains, including schools, is much less frequent. The results from this study corroborate a perception within the community that Portuguese lacks the prestige of Spanish and provide further evidence of its status as a primarily home language. The current research does not show a progressive shift toward Spanish in Rivera nor does it support claims by other researchers that this community is diglossic.

Starting out from a dialogist framework, a notion of participatory agency will be developed, based on the fact that speakers' situated languaging occurs in various activity types in direct or indirect interaction with others.

Abstract = {This research explores the cultural and linguistic strategies of immigrant youth to negotiate inclusion/exclusion, including language discrimination in Vancouver, Canada. My theoretical framework draws upon the Arendtian notions of ‘public space’, and ‘action and speech’ as well as Bourdieu’s concepts of ‘symbolic violence’ and ‘habitus’. My methodology is a critical qualitative approach. Fourteen immigrant youth, aged 15–25, were involved in this research. The findings of this study indicate that unlike second-generation immigrants, first-generation immigrant youth face cultural and linguistic challenges. Non-recognition of youths’ distinct linguistic and social capitals, the imposition of official languages and the regulation of the education and language market according to the dominant linguistic norms include forms of discrimination against Turkish minority youth in Canada. Taken together, the findings suggest that immigrant youths’ cultural and linguistic experiences of inclusion and exclusion cannot be dissociated from the wider politics of the nation-state, popular hegemony and social inequalities in the host society.

Abstract = {Inviting Citizen Designers to Design Learning Management System (LMS) Interfaces for Student Agency in a Digital Cross-Cultural Contact Zone assesses how FYC students from periphery cultural and linguistic backgrounds perceive Blackboard Learn and other learning management system (LMS) interfaces. The report of an empirical study shows that the current LMS design does not provide writing students in general and writing students from periphery cultural and linguistic backgrounds in particular an opportunity of a higher-level interactivity with the LMS. The current design neither includes periphery students' cultural and linguistic norms and values, nor does it allow them to affect the existing design through their design activities. These LMSs are currently constraining users from higher-level interactions. As a result, writing students have to act as the LMS ask them to do, and they remain passive in these platforms. Based on the web usability test responses, this study proposes to invite Citizen Designers, writing students from periphery cultural and linguistic backgrounds, to design LMS interfaces to enhance user activities and transform them into cross-cultural platforms. This study analyzes interface designs by Citizen Designers to see how designers acquire their agency in a cross-cultural digital contact zone. This study concludes that Citizen Designers' participation in interface design helps them create favorable electronic environments that help them acquire their agency and enhance their (digital) writings and researches.

Abstract = {In this article we introduce childLex, an online database for children’s print language in German. childLex is based on a large corpus of children’s books and textbooks used in school that comprises ca. 8 million words. It includes linguistic norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level. Such norms are urgently needed in psychological research for the design of age-adequate stimulus and training materials. Separate norms are available for three age groups: 6–8 years (1st and 2nd grade), 9–10 years (3rd and 4th grade), and 11–12 years (5th and 6th grade). Moreover, childLex is directly comparable to the DWDS corpus, a large corpus for adults’ print language. Here, we describe how childLex was collected and analyzed and compare frequency norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level with frequency norms obtained from the DWDS corpus. Results show moderate levels of correspondence in the high-frequency range and on the sub-lexical level, but strong discrepancies for medium- and low-frequency elements on the lexical and super-lexical level. Finally, we illustrate which variables are available in childLex and how they can be retrieved using a web interface. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This exploratory research proceeds from the perspective that language is ecological and dialogical. We examined variables derived from eco-dialogical coding of an episode of World of Warcraft play involving three English learners. According to the Eco-dialogical model (Zheng, 2012), second language (L2) learners need to learn to take skilled linguistic action (Cowley, 2013), a process of realizing the values of physical, sociocultural and dialogical affordances in the environment. We employed Multinomial Logistic Regression to determine which of our variables were predictors for three types of values realizing; namely, wayfinding orienting to sociocultural norms and synergized values realizing of both wayfinding and orientation to sociocultural norms. The model we developed suggested that when communicative projects collectively entailed players’ a) verbalizing with synchronized avatar action, b) attending to game rules and c) coordinating in anticipation of good future prospects, players were more likely to realize both values realizing types synergistically. In other words, players' skilled linguistic action of prospective coordination, combined with multimodal languaging and constrained by WoW game rules, together, were more likely to lead to dual values realizing. This finding suggests that dual values realizing evokes connections between real-time first-order physical movements and multimodal languaging with situation transcending practices (Linell, 2009) which are second-order rules, and other sociocultural and linguistic norms. Coupling this finding with our Eco-dialogical unit of analysis, communicative projects, we suggest that these language learners developed co-agency. We conclude that our model should be tested in future studies that seek to illuminate the contribution of a new Eco-dialogical understanding of L2 learning and the potential for learners to have high quality languaging experiences in multiplayer 3D game environments and other social semiotically rich contexts.

Abstract = {The critical role first aid responders, relief workers, and other medical personnel play in crisis and disaster settings cannot be understated. Especially in conflict areas, medical personnel face numerous threats to their security and physical well-being, putting them at risk of developing psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Because lay medics frequently function as the primary health providers in low-resource conflict situations, their mental health is crucial to the delivery of services to afflicted populations. In this chapter we examine the experiences of community health workers who serve displaced and war-affected populations in Karen State, eastern Burma. The evidence presented is based on the authors' previous qualitative research with this population. Though it is impossible to neatly deconstruct the myriad experiences of suffering, perseverance, and survivorship intrinsic to these medics' lives into the academic frameworks of psychology and psychiatry, an attempt at finding patterns in their narratives that parallel concepts in mental health literature may be helpful in developing evidence-based interventions. Incongruities are implicit in generalizations, and constant awareness of cultural relativism among widely different societal and linguistic norms must be maintained.

Abstract = {Linguistic research on the classroom behavior of school children has often shown that there is a tension between the development of an anti-authoritarian peer culture and the pressure to do well academically and behave in ways that meet adult approval. This tension is particularly strong for boys. In this context, violating the linguistic norms of the classroom is one way of rebelling and constructing a masculine identity which can gain peer approval. The rebellious and playful identities of the boys in this study are at times in conflict with their desire to be productive and high-achieving. In this study of an English Mother Tongue classroom in a German-American bilingual school in Berlin, Germany, five boys are faced with this dilemma. One tactic used by some of the boys to resolve the conflict is the use of Mock NSE. The use of Mock NSE by these boys is a salient socio-pragmatic device for indicating how they wish to be identified. These boys thus make use of the classroom norm of speaking Standard English by flouting it, creating new and multiple identities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This paper examines the sociolinguistic situation of a multilingual secondary school in the Barcelona metropolitan area and examines the language practices of both students and educators. Following a critical sociolinguistic ethnography perspective, it understands practices as constructing the socio-institutional order of the school, and language as constitutive of social processes. The analysis of the data shows that the students, the majority of which are of migrant background, systematically fail to employ Catalan, the language of schooling, and that the teachers refuse to enforce official linguistic norms. Rather than considering it exclusively a language issue, we claim that language is an index of a process of constructing the school as 'different' and the school body as non-academic. In the analysis of discourses and practices, social class emerges as one of the grounding motivations for such 'difference', which leads to low academic demands, a life skills educational perspective, and lack of competence in Catalan, with serious consequences for students’ social access.

Abstract = {This book offers an exciting new perspective on the origins of language. Language is conceptualized as a collective invention, on the model of writing or the wheel, and the book places social and cultural dynamics at the centre of its evolution: language emerged and further developed in human communities already suffused with meaning and communication, mimesis, ritual, song and dance, coparenting, new divisions of labour, and revolutionary changes in social relations. The book thus challenges assumptions about the causal relations between genes, capacities, social communication, and innovation: the biological capacities are taken to evolve incrementally on the basis of cognitive plasticity, in a process that recruits previous adaptations and fine-tunes them to serve novel communicative ends. Topics include the ability brought about by language to tell lies, which must have confronted our ancestors with new problems of public trust; the dynamics of social-cognitive co-evolution; the role of gesture and mimesis in linguistic communication; studies of how monkeys and apes express their feelings or thoughts; play, laughter, dance, song, ritual, and other social displays among extant hunter-gatherers; the social nature of language acquisition and innovation; normativity and the emergence of linguistic norms; the interaction of language and emotions; and novel perspectives on the timeframe for language evolution.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Le Francais en Amérique du Nord: État présent by Albert Valdman, Julie Auger, and Deborah Piston-Hatlen (eds.) (2005). Poirier, Boivin, Trepanier & Verreault 1994 gave us the first general overview of the French linguistic legacy in North America. Valdman and his team have updated that work, incorporating the findings of sociolinguistic research carried out over the past decade, notably in language obsolescence. The result is comprehensive treatment of all the main areas of North America where French is spoken. It is well organized, with an introductory chapter providing a succinct overview of the four sections to follow: The first describes where, how, and to what extent French is spoken in North America; the second examines language variation in each of these areas and the effects of language contact; the third looks at linguistic norms and language planning; and a fourth is devoted to more general comparative and historical issues. It is possible to point to improvements that could have been incorporated into the volume. There are occasional production blemishes. However, this volume offers an invaluable tool not only for students of French but also for sociolinguists concerned with the effects of language contact, language change, and language obsolescence.

Abstract = {This paper investigates the ways languages are used in Philadelphia Chinatown through qualitative content analysis of 330 photos. Examining the linguistic landscape of public spaces exposes issues of linguistic tensions, language vitality, and language shift in multilingual settings. While Chinese in the form of Mandarin is highly publicized, thereby placing disproportionate emphasis upon one language over others, Philadelphia Chinatown shows diversity, coexistence, and creative uses of multiple Chinese languages alongside English. The signage suggests linguistic rescaling connecting real and imagined audiences, conforming to broader 'Chinese' linguistic norms while localized to connect to a range of Chineses. We show how linguistic and cultural pluralism of 'Chinese' have always existed—and continue to exist—and the importance of developing socially sensitive literacy pedagogy, especially when there is a mismatch between the informal, community-level signage and what is formally taught in 'Chinese' language classrooms in the U.S. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The language of a speech community can only act as an identity marker for all of its speakers if linguistic norms are widely shared and if a minimal number of language varieties are spoken. This article examines briefly how a linguistic norm came to serve the whole of Iceland and how a situation of relative linguistic homogeneity was maintained for centuries. Sociolinguistic theory tells us that the speech community that we can reconstruct for early Iceland should lead to the establishment and maintenance of local norms. However, Iceland, arguably monodialectal, was certainly characterized by long-term linguistic homogeneity and remained a society where nucleated settlements barely formed over a thousand-year period. Scholars have argued that a mixture of dialects leveled shortly after the settlement of Iceland in the ninth century (Settlement). Studies show that dialect leveling requires dialect mixing, the convergence of people on one place, and sustained linguistic contact between the speakers. The settlement pattern of Iceland is indicative of population divergence (not convergence) and there is limited evidence of sustained contact. It is therefore proposed that the dialect leveling might be linked instead with significant population movements and social upheaval in mainland Scandinavia in the immediate pre-Viking period. The variety of Norse that was taken westward across the Atlantic might itself already have been the result of several earlier stages of mixing and koineization. It is only by combining linguistic, historical, and archaeological knowledge that this problem of how one linguistic norm came to serve the whole of Iceland can be understood.

Abstract = {This paper examines the ideologies and practices surrounding respect at a Korean American heritage language school in California. It illustrates the interaction between locally circulating metadiscourses about children’s dispositions, intentions, and identities and the enforcement of classroom norms of respect. In some cases, teachers accommodated to children’s linguistic norms though a metadiscourse that reframed the indexicality of potentially disrespectful behavior. In other cases, forms of bodily demeanor were naturalized as indexical of children’s deliberate communication of disrespect. Teachers’ classroom narratives presented theories of affective accommodation and affective display, where respect for a teacher’s feelings was supposed to be given priority over respect for a child’s feelings, but children did not always comply with these theories. By illustrating how teachers’ metapragmatic ideologies about children’s identities as Korean Americans, contexts of language acquisition, and linguistic needs mediate the interactional construction of (dis)respect, this paper demonstrates the hybrid/multidirectional nature of language socialization.

Abstract = {Workplaces constitute important sites where individuals construct and negotiate their various social identities. And one of the most crucial sites where this identity construction takes place is in working groups (which often form communities of practice). Over time, these groups may develop a shared repertoire of linguistic norms on which members regularly draw when interacting with each other. Drawing on over 40 h of authentic discourse data, this paper illustrates how three leaders construct their professional identities by using teasing humour in ways that exploit the specific discursive norms that characterise their respective working groups. Teasing comprises a valuable component of the linguistic repertoire negotiated among group members. This discourse strategy not only constitutes a prime means for identity construction but also assists the leaders in achieving their various workplace objectives. A comparison of the ways in which the leaders use teasing humour indicates substantial pragmatic differences in their choice of teasing style. These differences reflect, contribute to and reinforce the normative communicative behaviours which characterise the leaders’ working groups. By systematically drawing on the discursive style developed in their respective community of practice, the leaders 'do leadership' in ways that are considered appropriate and normative in their workplace.

Abstract = {Language can serve as a potent and injurious tool against ambitious women in the workplace. Consider how often both men and women have thought or said 'bitch' or other derogatory terms when describing a woman in a leadership position. Freud once described mental health as the ability to love and to work. For many of these women, their work has also become their love, their passion. Working long hours, often working 'twice as hard as men,' to be viewed as equally competent, perhaps sacrificing spouse and children in deference to career, these women have been inculcated into a patriarchal corporate environment, one in which they must act in a sexual dissonant manner in order to succeed. And as they negotiate the male managerial model, they often come to view their own femininity in an objectified, disparaging way. They may defeminize their language and adopt a 'more adversarial, information-focused style characteristic of all male talk'. Here is where the dilemma begins: If they conform to the masculine linguistic norms of the corporate environment, then their behavior can be perceived as confrontational, harsh, contentious, un-lady-like. A collision of culture ensues on intrapsychic and interpersonal levels between what is expected of a woman in society and what is expected of a person in a high status position where valued leadership traits are male-gendered. Often these women select language and styles that veer away from the feminine side of the gender spectrum. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

This book addresses the impact of digital technologies on reading and writing practices by contextualizing these developments within the communication technologies that have preceded them. Though computers are often blamed for a perceived deterioration of culture and language, Baron notes that scorn and mistrust of communication technologies is not a new phenomenon; in fact, writing, the printing press, and the telegraph were all greeted at first with skepticism. And despite the pervasive anxiety that 'internet speech' is resulting in the destruction of grammar and spelling, Baron observes that online communities enforce their own linguistic norms. Rather than a linguistic free-for-all, Baron argues, 'spelling counts' in virtual spaces just as it does offline. In sum, Baron accounts for both the benefits and pitfalls of the digital revolution and analyzes it as merely another set of technological innovations, usefully situating them within a history of writing technologies.

Abstract = {Reply by the current authors to the review by Constant Leung (see record [rid]2008-09991-006[/rid]) on the original book, Language testing: The social dimension (2006). Leung has drawn attention to possibly the most obvious gap in our treatment: a properly elaborated discussion of the assessment of English as a lingua franca. While consideration of this issue has begun in the work of authors he cites in his review, and elsewhere, it is, as Leung points out, a multiply complex issue, in which the social dimension is the crux of the problem, ‘in terms of speaker subject positions, lexicogrammatical norms, transcultural pragmatic conventions and so on’. It is clear that language testing—particularly significant here as a site of authority about linguistic norms, not unlike a dictionary—has an important role to play in authorizing or de-authorizing English as a lingua franca communication as a proper target for language learning; a further demonstration, if one were needed, of the power of tests. But beyond this political and institutional dimension, the psychometric problems inherent in designing tests based on a construct that is local, situated, and fluid pose a difficult but productive challenge to testers.

Abstract = {It is important that a book on adolescence should contain a chapter on slang and swearing because these are two features of adolescent linguistic behavior that attract more attention than they perhaps warrant, symbolizing as they do, the freedom that young people have at this stage of their lives to challenge linguistic norms, and at the same time to test interpersonal bonds and institutional constraints with their parents as they seek to establish new identities and relationships within their changing worlds. This chapter will start by providing a brief background description of the linguistic characteristics of slang and swearing before moving to a more focused discussion of why (although such language is also commonly used by many adult groups who find themselves living in close proximity in institutionalized contexts such as prisons or military camps), it may be particularly typical of adolescent speech. Subsequent sections of the chapter explore how the use of slang and expletives by young people can be viewed as a means of building cultural capital within their networks, while at the same time establishing boundaries between new adolescent in-groups ('us') and parents and nonmembers ('them'). A section on the use of pejorative terms further develops this theme of 'us' and 'them.' In addition, I also consider gender-based patterns of the ways young people use slang and expletives, and the subtle coercive effect such words have in regulating typical patterns of in-group behavior. Finally some suggestions are made regarding research questions that still require attention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Language is a major resource in the creation of our gendered sense of self, with styles stereotypically associated with male and female.

Abstract = {The institutionalization of separate standard varieties for Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian in the 1990s was hailed by many Bosnians as the long-denied recognition of the Bosnian idiom as distinct from the Serbian and Croatian varieties it had so often been subordinated under. Yet the accompanying codification of Bosnian standard language forms has been highly controversial in Bosnia, and debates continue today about how to define the Bosnian language My dissertation explores the paradox that while many Bosnians support the Bosnian language as a name, they often do not support it as a norm . To explore this paradox, I undertook 12 months of fieldwork in four different middle schools in Bosnia. Education is a domain in which linguistic norms are highlighted. In Bosnia, it is also an area in which language variation is deemed to be particularly problematic by observers, participants, and commentators both locally and abroad. The decentralized nature of education in Bosnia means that classrooms are often ethnically segregated and curricula in use across the country are not harmonized. Language standardization has often been analyzed as a state-sponsored process that works through official institutions to reduce heterogeneity and promote uniform understandings of linguistic forms and their semiotic meanings. This dissertation explores ongoing language standardization campaigns in Bosnia and Herzegovina and argues that traditional ways of understanding the role of institutions in language standardization don't explain why standardization has been so unsuccessful in the post-war Bosnian state. My research challenges the idea that institutions must be engaged in drawing rigid us/them boundaries to be thought of as representative or legitimate, instead pointing to the possibility that ambiguity can be a marker of legitimacy rather than a threat to it. This dissertation explores how ideologies of heterogeneity and free choice in language work against the imposition of a standard norm at the same time as European aspirations and ideas about post-socialist normalcy push many Bosnians to believe their country should have such a standard. The resulting tension is the space in which choice between standard variants takes on social meaning and contributes to emerging definitions of what it means to be Bosnian.

Abstract = {A theory of linguistic behavior is presented. An integration with psychological theory, with justice to the complexities of linguistic structure, is attempted. Fundamentally, speech behavior is a series of movements in which certain uniformities can be found. Some of these uniformities are linguistic norms; others of a more psychological nature are related to conditions under which speech responses occur. The linguistic response-type is defined as any uniformity in speech behavior which exhibits a certain behavioral structure. This common behavioral structure is characterized in some detail. Employing the qualifications listed, one can separate linguistic from nonlinguistic behavior. The former includes all speech behavior as well as many nonvocal gestures. Psychological properties of linguistic response-types are to be studied in terms of their strength. Thus verbal behavior 'is seen as a series of movements patterned in overlapping units. The uniformities underlying these movements exist as behavioral habits, or response-types, the strengths of which are subject to continual change.'
