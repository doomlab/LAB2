Abstract = {The paper presents the model of the organization of the linguistic database as part of linguistic support of the automatic processing of natural language text information. The peculiarity of the proposed model is to separate the knowledge of the language system of knowledge about the world (domain). The developed model of a linguistic database in comparison with known characterized by significantly lower volumes of dictionaries, data format allows you to simulate patterns as inflected languages and analytical. It is able to provide the processing of natural language text for a variety of applications.

Abstract = {We consider linguistic data(base) summaries in the sense of Yager [Information Sciences 28 (1982) 69-86], exemplified by "most employees are young and well paid" (with some degree of truth added), for a personnel database, as an intuitive, human consistent and natural language based knowledge discovery tool. We present first an extension of the classic Yager's approach to involve more sophisticated criteria of goodness, search methods, etc. We advocate the use of the concept of a protoform (prototypical form), that is recently vividly advocated by Zadeh [A prototype-centered approach to adding deduction capabilities to search engines—the concept of a protoform. BISC Seminar, University of California, Berkeley, 2002], as a general form of a linguistic data summary. We present an extension of our interactive approach, based on fuzzy logic and fuzzy database queries, which makes it possible to implement such linguistic data summaries.

Abstract = {Lexicon-Grammar tables, whose development was initiated by Gross (1975), are a very rich syntactic lexicon for the French language. They cover various lexical catégories such as verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. This linguistic database is nevertheless not directly usable by computer programs, as it is incomplète and lacks consistency. Tables are defined on the basis of features which are not explicitly recorded in the lexicon. Thèse features are only described in literature. To use thèse tables, we must make explicit the essential features appearing in each one of them. In addition, many features must be renamed for consistency sake. Our aim is to adapt the tables, so as to make them usable in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, in particular parsing. We describe the problems we encountered and the approaches we followed to enable their intégration into a parser.

By reconsidering all items of the omission of -s recorded to date in the Computerized Historical Linguistic Database of Latin Inscriptions of the Imperial Age, the morphosyntactic explanation proposed by Herman (1987=2006) as for relevant omissions will be replaced by a phonetic and phonosyntactic approach which evidences the all-time prevalence of the consonantal environment in the omission of word final -s. Accordingly, the phonosyntactically determined deletion of word final -s before a subsequent consonant existed continuously but to various degrees from the Old Latin age onward all along the history of Latin. This situation might have been inherited by the Romance languages, where different and complex morphological innovations led either to the discontinuation of the phenomenon of phonosyntactically determine)},

Abstract = {We present how the conceptually and numerically simple concept of a fuzzy linguistic database summary can be a very powerful tool for gaining much insight into the very essence of data. The use of linguistic summaries provides tools for the verbalisation of data analysis (mining) results which, in addition to the more commonly used visualisation, e.g. via a graphical user interface, can contribute to an increased human consistency and ease of use, notably for supporting decision makers via the data-driven decision support system paradigm. Two new relevant aspects of the analysis are also outlined which were first initiated by the authors. First, following Kacprzyk and Zadrozny, it is further considered how linguistic data summarisation is closely related to some types of solutions used in natural language generation (NLG). This can make it possible to use more and more effective and efficient tools and techniques developed in NLG. Second, similar remarks are given on relations to syst)},

Abstract = {The cross-linguistic evidence presented in this special issue may be unprecedented in bringing together data from a substantial number of young children exposed to diverse language pairs and bilingual backgrounds. Attempts at controlling methodological variability add to the value of the findings. Collectively, the results reported here may contribute to a better theoretical understanding of the universal mechanisms involved in bilingual language acquisition. The present findings also have important implications for clinical practice as they shed light on the expressive vocabulary abilities that may be expected of typically developing children having different bilingual backgrounds and the risk or protective effect of environmental factors. Clinicians should therefore be better equipped at distinguishing clinically significant language delays from natural consequences of bilingual exposure in specific contexts. Finally, this research endeavour hopes to pave the way for further investigations of the vocabulary skills of children raised in other bilingual, or even multilingual, settings. By following the same methodological design, researchers would support the expansion of the current cross-linguistic database and add to its theoretical and clinical value.

As the nation is about to face a tremendous decline in the experienced workforce due to the baby boomer generation’s retirement, it is critical to begin focusing on capturing their knowledge. Cataloging and communicating the knowledge of potential failures is critical to prevent engineering disasters. Many companies have adopted failure-reporting systems that allow them to record their engineering failures to promote failure prevention. While recording this information is vital to learning from past mistakes, often the information is not stored so that engineers and designers can easily recall this valuable linguistic information and use it to improve designs. Therefore, more effective systems for cataloging and utilizing corporate memory of recorded failure events are needed.

From that moment, dialect studies have continuously benefitted from the innovations that took place in the field of digital technologies. At present, linguistic geography projects are fully integrated within the Digital Humanities and are governed by the same principles that guide studies in this discipline: the interoperability of applications, free reuse of data and interdisciplinarity. This paper provides a brief outline of the structure and design of the database that currently houses the Atlas Lingüístico Galego materials, a linguistic atlas of Galician begun as a project in the 1970s.

Abstract = {SLIM is a prototype interactive multimedia self-learning linguistic software for foreign language students at beginner-false beginner level. It allows students to work both in an autonomous self-directed mode or in a way of programmed learning in which the process of self-instruction is pre-programmed and monitored. In this latter mode it incorporates assessment and evaluation tools in order to behave as an automatic tutor. It is organized into three basic components: audiovisual materials; a linguistic database recording all language material in text format; the supervisor. Audiovisual materials are partially taken from commercially available courses; the linguistic database is a highly sophisticated classification of all words and utterances of the course, both in written and spoken form, from all possible linguistic aspects. The supervisor is both an attractive, enjoyable and strongly pedagogically based software that allows the user to work on language materials. The most outstanding feature of SLIM is the use of speech analysis and recognition which is a fundamental aspect of all second language learning programmes. We also assume that a learning model can be represented by a finite state automaton made up by a fixed number of possible states - corresponding to the macro and microlevels at which the student's competence may be modelled - each one being internally constituted by the actual linguistic objects of knowledge of the language that make it up.

We show basic capabilities of Quantirius, our interactive system supporting the mining and the assessment of linguistic summaries in a database. The mining of linguistic summaries is realized by means of the concept of a protoform introduced by Zadeh. The assessment of validity degrees of summaries is done via Zadeh's fuzzy logic based calculus, extended by the use of cardinality patterns and triangular norms. The main part of the paper presents an idea of a further processing of the set of generated summaries. The proposed algorithm is composed of a reduction mechanism of summaries based on linguistic terms inclusion and a reduction of summaries by means of the overlapping unimodal linguistic terms. We then present an idea of the approval threshold computing for the truth degrees of summaries. Finally, we show that summaries generated by different protoforms can be j)},

As there does not exist any published work in formal linguistics nor any recognizable standard for Vietnamese word definition and word categories, the fundamental tasks for automatic Vietnamese language processing, such as part-of-speech tagging, parsing, etc., are very difficult tasks for computer scientists. The fact that all necessary linguistic resources have to be built from scratch by each research team is a real obstacle to the development of Vietnamese language processing. The aim of our projects is thus to build a common linguistic database that is freely and easily exploitable for the automatic processing of Vietnamese.

Abstract = {It is well known that secondary articulation types, such as labialization and palatalization, as well as laryngeal modifications, such as aspiration and glottalization, can play a contrastive role in segment inventories. This article describes an investigation of such segmental modifications, whether laryngeal, supralaryngeal or nasal, on the basis of detailed analyses of each of the 317 languages in the cross-linguistic database presented in Maddieson (1984). In the first part of this investigation, the hypothesis is tested that segmental modifications occur on natural classes of consonants rather than randomly or on isolated segments. A formalism is proposed to express this regularity. Recent theoretical proposals concerning the representation of complex segments, in particular affricates, lead to predictions regarding the patterning of segmental modification on such segments; in the second part of our investigation, these predictions are tested against the cross-linguistic data on )},

Abstract = {The present research investigated Internet search engines as a rapid, cost-effective alternative for estimating word frequencies. Frequency estimates for 382 words were obtained and compared across four methods: Internet search engines, the Kucera and Francis (1967) analysis of a traditional linguistic corpus, the CELEX English linguistic database, and participant ratings of familiarity. The results showed that Internet search engines produced frequency estimates that were highly consistent with those reported by Kucera and Francis and those calculated from CELEX, highly consistent across search engines, and very reliable over a 6-month period of time. Additional results suggested that Internet search engines are an excellent option when traditional word frequency analyses do not contain the necessary data (e.g., estimates for forenames and slang). In contrast, participants' familiarity judgments did not correspond well with the more objective estimates of word frequency. Researchers are advised to use search engines with large databases to ensure the greatest representativeness of the frequency estimates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In this article we introduce childLex, an online database for children’s print language in German. childLex is based on a large corpus of children’s books and textbooks used in school that comprises ca. 8 million words. It includes linguistic norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level. Such norms are urgently needed in psychological research for the design of age-adequate stimulus and training materials. Separate norms are available for three age groups: 6–8 years (1st and 2nd grade), 9–10 years (3rd and 4th grade), and 11–12 years (5th and 6th grade). Moreover, childLex is directly comparable to the DWDS corpus, a large corpus for adults’ print language. Here, we describe how childLex was collected and analyzed and compare frequency norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level with frequency norms obtained from the DWDS corpus. Results show moderate levels of correspondence in the high-frequency range and on the sub-lexical level, but strong discrepancies for medium- and low-frequency elements on the lexical and super-lexical level. Finally, we illustrate which variables are available in childLex and how they can be retrieved using a web interface. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
