"1","KeywordsNonlinear mixed-effects location scale model Verbal learning Intra-individual variability Bayesian inference ","a bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects location scale model for learning","We present a Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects location scale model (NL-MELSM). The NL-MELSM allows for fitting nonlinear functions to the location, or individual means, and the scale, or within-person variance. Specifically, in the context of learning, this model allows the within-person variance to follow a nonlinear trajectory, where it can be determined whether variability reduces during learning. It incorporates a sub-model that can predict nonlinear parameters for both the location and scale. This specification estimates random effects for all nonlinear location and scale parameters that are drawn from a common multivariate distribution. This allows estimation of covariances among the random effects, within and across the location and the scale. These covariances offer new insights into the interplay between individual mean structures and intra-individual variability in nonlinear parameters. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only for ease of estimation but also for inference because it provides the necessary and consistent information for use in psychological applications, such as model selection and hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model, we use data from 333 individuals, consisting of three age groups, who participated in five learning trials that assessed verbal memory. In an exploratory context, we demonstrate that fitting a nonlinear function to the within-person variance, and allowing for individual variation therein, improves predictive accuracy compared to customary modeling techniques (e.g., assuming constant variance). We conclude by discussing the usefulness, limitations, and future directions of the NL-MELSM.","No","nonlinear mixedeffect locat scale model verbal learn intraindividu variabl bayesian infer bayesian nonlinear mixedeffect locat scale model learn present bayesian nonlinear mixedeffect locat scale model nlmelsm nlmelsm fit nonlinear function locat individu mean scale person varianc specif context learn model person varianc follow nonlinear trajectori determin variabl reduc learn incorpor model predict nonlinear paramet locat scale specif estim random effect nonlinear locat scale paramet drawn common multivari distribut estim covari random effect locat scale covari offer insight interplay individu structur intraindividu variabl nonlinear paramet fulli bayesian approach eas estim infer consist inform psycholog applic model select hypothesi test illustr model data individu consist age group particip learn trial assess verbal memori exploratori context demonstr fit nonlinear function person varianc allow individu variat improv predict accuraci compar customari model techniqu assum constant varianc conclud discuss use limit futur direct nlmelsm",1
"2","KeywordsSemantic ambiguity Homonyms Meaning frequency Homonym norming methods and data Movie subtitles Free association Homonym meaning annotations ","a comparison of homonym meaning frequency estimates derived from movie and television subtitles, free association, and explicit ratings","Most words are ambiguous, with interpretation dependent on context. Advancing theories of ambiguity resolution is important for any general theory of language processing, and for resolving inconsistencies in observed ambiguity effects across experimental tasks. Focusing on homonyms (words such as bank with unrelated meanings EDGE OF A RIVER vs. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION), the present work advances theories and methods for estimating the relative frequency of their meanings, a factor that shapes observed ambiguity effects. We develop a new method for estimating meaning frequency based on the meaning of a homonym evoked in lines of movie and television subtitles according to human raters. We also replicate and extend a measure of meaning frequency derived from the classification of free associates. We evaluate the internal consistency of these measures, compare them to published estimates based on explicit ratings of each meaning’s frequency, and compare each set of norms in predicting performance in lexical and semantic decision mega-studies. All measures have high internal consistency and show agreement, but each is also associated with unique variance, which may be explained by integrating cognitive theories of memory with the demands of different experimental methodologies. To derive frequency estimates, we collected manual classifications of 533 homonyms over 50,000 lines of subtitles, and of 357 homonyms across over 5000 homonym–associate pairs. This database—publicly available at: www.blairarmstrong.net/homonymnorms/—constitutes a novel resource for computational cognitive modeling and computational linguistics, and we offer suggestions around good practices for its use in training and testing models on labeled data.","No","semant ambigu homonym mean frequenc homonym norm method data movi subtitl free associ homonym mean annot comparison homonym mean frequenc estim deriv movi televis subtitl free associ explicit rate word ambigu interpret depend context advanc theori ambigu resolut import general theori languag process resolv inconsist observ ambigu effect experiment task focus homonym word bank unrel mean edg river financi institut present work advanc theori method estim relat frequenc mean factor shape observ ambigu effect develop method estim mean frequenc base mean homonym evok line movi televis subtitl human rater replic extend measur mean frequenc deriv classif free associ evalu intern consist measur compar publish estim base explicit rate mean frequenc compar set norm predict perform lexic semant decis megastudi measur high intern consist show agreement uniqu varianc explain integr cognit theori memori demand experiment methodolog deriv frequenc estim collect manual classif homonym line subtitl homonym homonym associ pair databas public wwwblairarmstrongnethomonymnorm constitut resourc comput cognit model comput linguist offer suggest good practic train test model label data",1

We applied the proposed model to a dataset to compare its performance with traditional DCMs for polytomous items. We also conducted a simulation study based on the applied study condition in order to evaluate the parameter recovery of the proposed model. The findings suggest that the proposed model shows promise for (1) accommodating much smaller sample sizes by reducing a large number of parameters for estimation; (2) obtaining item category response probabilities and individual scores very similar to those from a traditional saturated model; and (3) providing general item information that is not available in traditional DCMs for polytomous items.","No","diagnost classif model rate scale psycholog assess polytom item respons nomin respons diagnost model general diagnost classif model rate scale studi propos evalu general diagnost classif model dcm rate scale appli propos model dataset compar perform tradit dcms polytom item conduct simul studi base appli studi condit order evalu paramet recoveri propos model find suggest propos model show promis accommod smaller sampl size reduc larg number paramet estim obtain item categori respons probabl individu score similar tradit satur model provid general item inform tradit dcms polytom item",1
"4","KeywordsDecision-making Evidence accumulation models Random number generation Probability density approximation ","a method, framework, and tutorial for efficiently simulating models of decision-making","Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) have become the dominant models of rapid decision-making. Several variants of these models have been proposed, ranging from the simple linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) to the more complex leaky-competing accumulator (LCA), and further extensions that include time-varying rates of evidence accumulation or decision thresholds. Although applications of the simpler variants have been widespread, applications of the more complex models have been fewer, largely due to their intractable likelihood function and the computational cost of mass simulation. Here, I present a framework for efficiently fitting complex EAMs, which uses a new, efficient method of simulating these models. I find that the majority of simulation time is taken up by random number generation (RNG) from the normal distribution, needed for the stochastic noise of the differential equation. To reduce this inefficiency, I propose using the well-known concept within computer science of “look-up tables” (LUTs) as an approximation to the inverse cumulative density function (iCDF) method of RNG, which I call “LUT-iCDF”. I show that when using an appropriately sized LUT, simulations using LUT-iCDF closely match those from the standard RNG method in R. My framework, which I provide a detailed tutorial on how to implement, includes C code for 12 different variants of EAMs using the LUT-iCDF method, and should make the implementation of complex EAMs easier and faster.","No","decisionmak evid accumul model random number generat probabl densiti approxim method framework tutori effici simul model decisionmak evid accumul model eam domin model rapid decisionmak variant model propos rang simpl linear ballist accumul lba complex leakycompet accumul lca extens includ timevari rate evid accumul decis threshold applic simpler variant widespread applic complex model fewer larg due intract likelihood function comput cost mass simul present framework effici fit complex eam effici method simul model find major simul time random number generat rng normal distribut need stochast nois differenti equat reduc ineffici propos concept comput scienc tabl lut approxim invers cumul densiti function icdf method rng call luticdf show appropri size lut simul luticdf close match standard rng method framework provid detail tutori implement includ code variant eam luticdf method make implement complex eam easier faster",1
"5","KeywordsNavigation Route learning Navigation test Cognitive aging ","a novel virtual-reality-based route-learning test suite: assessing the effects of cognitive aging on navigation","Most research groups studying human navigational behavior with virtual environment (VE) technology develop their own tasks and protocols. This makes it difficult to compare results between groups and to create normative data sets for any specific navigational task. Such norms, however, are prerequisites for the use of navigation assessments as diagnostic tools—for example, to support the early and differential diagnosis of atypical aging. Here we start addressing these problems by presenting and evaluating a new navigation test suite that we make freely available to other researchers (https://osf.io/mx52y/). Specifically, we designed three navigational tasks, which are adaptations of earlier published tasks used to study the effects of typical and atypical aging on navigation: a route-repetition task that can be solved using egocentric navigation strategies, and route-retracing and directional-approach tasks that both require allocentric spatial processing. Despite introducing a number of changes to the original tasks to make them look more realistic and ecologically valid, and therefore easy to explain to people unfamiliar with a VE or who have cognitive impairments, we replicated the findings from the original studies. Specifically, we found general age-related declines in navigation performance and additional specific difficulties in tasks that required allocentric processes. These findings demonstrate that our new tasks have task demands similar to those of the original tasks, and are thus suited to be used more widely.","No","navig rout learn navig test cognit age virtualrealitybas routelearn test suit assess effect cognit age navig research group studi human navig behavior virtual environ ve technolog develop task protocol make difficult compar result group creat normat data set specif navig task norm prerequisit navig assess diagnost tool support earli differenti diagnosi atyp age start address problem present evalu navig test suit make freeli research httpsosfiomxi specif design navig task adapt earlier publish task studi effect typic atyp age navig routerepetit task solv egocentr navig strategi routeretrac directionalapproach task requir allocentr spatial process introduc number origin task make realist ecolog valid easi explain peopl unfamiliar ve cognit impair replic find origin studi specif found general agerel declin navig perform addit specif difficulti task requir allocentr process find demonstr task task demand similar origin task suit wide",1
"6","KeywordsEye tracking Nystagmus Calibration ","a robust method for calibration of eye tracking data recorded during nystagmus","Eye tracking is a useful tool when studying the oscillatory eye movements associated with nystagmus. However, this oscillatory nature of nystagmus is problematic during calibration since it introduces uncertainty about where the person is actually looking. This renders comparisons between separate recordings unreliable. Still, the influence of the calibration protocol on eye movement data from people with nystagmus has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we propose a calibration method using Procrustes analysis in combination with an outlier correction algorithm, which is based on a model of the calibration data and on the geometry of the experimental setup. The proposed method is compared to previously used calibration polynomials in terms of accuracy, calibration plane distortion and waveform robustness. Six recordings of calibration data, validation data and optokinetic nystagmus data from people with nystagmus and seven recordings from a control group were included in the study. Fixation errors during the recording of calibration data from the healthy participants were introduced, simulating fixation errors caused by the oscillatory movements found in nystagmus data. The outlier correction algorithm improved the accuracy for all tested calibration methods. The accuracy and calibration plane distortion performance of the Procrustes analysis calibration method were similar to the top performing mapping functions for the simulated fixation errors. The performance in terms of waveform robustness was superior for the Procrustes analysis calibration compared to the other calibration methods. The overall performance of the Procrustes calibration methods was best for the datasets containing errors during the calibration.","No","eye track nystagmus calibr robust method calibr eye track data record nystagmus eye track tool studi oscillatori eye movement nystagmus oscillatori natur nystagmus problemat calibr introduc uncertainti person render comparison separ record unreli influenc calibr protocol eye movement data peopl nystagmus investig work propos calibr method procrust analysi combin outlier correct algorithm base model calibr data geometri experiment setup propos method compar previous calibr polynomi term accuraci calibr plane distort waveform robust record calibr data valid data optokinet nystagmus data peopl nystagmus record control group includ studi fixat error record calibr data healthi particip introduc simul fixat error caus oscillatori movement found nystagmus data outlier correct algorithm improv accuraci test calibr method accuraci calibr plane distort perform procrust analysi calibr method similar top perform map function simul fixat error perform term waveform robust superior procrust analysi calibr compar calibr method perform procrust calibr method dataset error calibr",1

However, performing a qualitative analysis across a massive social media data set is cumbersome and impractical. Instead, researchers often extract a subset of content to analyze, but a framework to facilitate this process is currently lacking. We present a four-phased framework for improving this extraction process, which blends the capacities of data science techniques to compress large data sets into smaller spaces, with the capabilities of qualitative analysis to address research questions. We demonstrate this framework by investigating the topics of Australian Twitter commentary on climate change, using quantitative (non-negative matrix inter-joint factorization; topic alignment) and qualitative (thematic analysis) techniques. Our approach is useful for researchers seeking to perform qualitative analyses of social media, or researchers wanting to supplement their quantitative work with a qualitative analysis of broader social context and meaning.","No","big data topic model themat analysi twitter climat chang joint matrix factor topic align analyz social media data mixedmethod framework combin comput qualit text analysi qualit research social media offer opportun harvest massiv divers rang content intrus intens data collect procedur perform qualit analysi massiv social media data set cumbersom impract research extract subset content analyz framework facilit process lack present phase framework improv extract process blend capac data scienc techniqu compress larg data set smaller space capabl qualit analysi address research question demonstr framework investig topic australian twitter commentari climat chang quantit negat matrix interjoint factor topic align qualit themat analysi techniqu approach research seek perform qualit analys social media research want supplement quantit work qualit analysi broader social context mean",1
"8","KeywordsAutobiographical memory Text mining Natural language processing ","autobiographical recall of personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails: an automatic analytic approach using e-mail communications","An important question that arises from autobiographical memory research is whether the variables that influence memory in the laboratory also drive memory for autobiographical episodes in real life. We explored this question within the context of e-mail communications and investigated the variables that influence recall for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails. We designed a Web-based program that analyzed each participant’s year-old sent e-mail archive and applied textual analysis algorithms to identify a set of sentences likely to be memorable. These sentences were then used as the stimuli in a cued recall task. Participants saw two sentences from their sent e-mail as a cue and attempted to recall the name of the e-mail recipient. Participants also rated the vividness of recall for the e-mail conversation and estimated the month in which they had written the e-mail. Linear mixed-effect analyses revealed that recipient name recall accuracy decreased with longer retention intervals and increased with greater frequency of contact with the recipient. Also, with longer retention intervals, participants dated e-mails as being more recent than their actual month. This telescoping error was moderately larger for e-mails with greater sentiment. These findings suggest that memory for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails closely follows the patterns for autobiographical memory and proper-name recall found in laboratory settings. This study introduces an innovative, Web-based experimental method for studying the cognitive processes related to autobiographical memories using ecologically valid, naturalistic communications.","No","autobiograph memori text mine natur languag process autobiograph recal person familiar name tempor inform mail automat analyt approach mail communic import question aris autobiograph memori research variabl influenc memori laboratori drive memori autobiograph episod real life explor question context mail communic investig variabl influenc recal person familiar name tempor inform mail design webbas program analyz particip year mail archiv appli textual analysi algorithm identifi set sentenc memor sentenc stimuli cu recal task particip sentenc mail cue attempt recal mail recipi particip rate vivid recal mail convers estim month written mail linear mixedeffect analys reveal recipi recal accuraci decreas longer retent interv increas greater frequenc contact recipi longer retent interv particip date mail recent actual month telescop error moder larger mail greater sentiment find suggest memori person familiar name tempor inform mail close pattern autobiograph memori proper recal found laboratori set studi introduc innov webbas experiment method studi cognit process relat autobiograph memori ecolog valid naturalist communic",1
"9","KeywordsConceptual recurrence analysis Text analysis Semantic similarity Semantic coordination Team communication Interpersonal communication ","beyond frequency counts: novel conceptual recurrence analysis metrics to index semantic coordination in team communications","Semantic alignment is a key process underlying interpersonal and team communication. However, semantic similarity is difficult to quantify, and statistical approaches designed to measure it often rely on methods that make the identification of the relative importance of key words difficult. This study outlines how conceptual recurrence analysis (CRA) can address these issues and can be used to detect conceptual structure in interpersonal communication. We developed several novel CRA metrics to analyze communication data reported previously by Mancuso, Finomore, Rahill, Blair, and Funke (Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 58, 405–409, 2014), gathered from teams who worked cooperatively on a logic puzzle under different cognitive biasing contexts. CRA, like other measures of semantic coordination, relies on parameters whose values affect estimates of semantic alignment. We evaluated how the dimensionality of semantic spaces affects metrics quantifying the conceptual similarity of communicative exchanges, and whether metrics calculated from top-down, a priori semantic spaces or bottom-up semantic spaces empirically derived from each data set were more sensitive to biasing context. We found that the novel CRA measures were sensitive to manipulations of cognitive bias, and that higher-dimensional, bottom-up semantic spaces generally yielded more sensitivity to the experimental manipulations, though when the communication was evaluated with respect to specific key concepts, lower-dimensional, top-down spaces performed nearly as well. We conclude that CRA is sensitive to experimental manipulations in ways consistent with prior findings and that it presents a customizable framework for testing predictions about interpersonal communication patterns and other linguistic exchanges.","No","conceptu recurr analysi text analysi semant similar semant coordin team communic interperson communic frequenc count conceptu recurr analysi metric index semant coordin team communic semant align key process under interperson team communic semant similar difficult quantifi statist approach design measur reli method make identif relat import key word difficult studi outlin conceptu recurr analysi cra address issu detect conceptu structur interperson communic develop cra metric analyz communic data report previous mancuso finomor rahil blair funk proceed human factor ergonom societi annual meet gather team work cooper logic puzzl cognit bias context cra measur semant coordin reli paramet valu affect estim semant align evalu dimension semant space affect metric quantifi conceptu similar communic exchang metric calcul top priori semant space bottom semant space empir deriv data set sensit bias context found cra measur sensit manipul cognit bias higherdimension bottom semant space general yield sensit experiment manipul communic evalu respect specif key concept lowerdimension top space perform conclud cra sensit experiment manipul way consist prior find present customiz framework test predict interperson communic pattern linguist exchang",1

Access to these data can be both complex for novices and difficult to automate for advanced users, however. To address these issues, we introduce childes-db, a database-formatted mirror of CHILDES that improves data accessibility and usability by offering novel interfaces, including browsable web applications and an R application programming interface (API).

Apart from collecting writing latencies, durations, and accuracy, we also compiled 14 lexical variables for each character. Regressions showed that frequency, age of acquisition, and the word context (in which a character appears) are all-around and influential predictors of orthographic access (as reflected in writing latency), motor execution of handwriting (as reflected in writing duration), and accuracy. In addition, phonological factors (phonogram status, spelling regularity, and homophone density) impacted orthographic access but not handwriting execution. Semantic factors (imageability and concreteness) only affected accuracy. These results suggest, among other things, that phonology is consulted in orthographic access while handwriting. As the first of its kind, this database can be used as a source of secondary data analyses and a tool for stimulus construction in handwriting research.","No","handwrit chines databas lexicon phonolog orthographi chines charact handwrit largescal behavior studi databas report psycholinguist databas chines charact handwrit base largescal studi involv particip handwrit charact random sampl cohort charact collect write latenc durat accuraci compil lexic variabl charact regress show frequenc age acquisit word context charact appear influenti predictor orthograph access reflect write latenc motor execut handwrit reflect write durat accuraci addit phonolog factor phonogram status spell regular homophon densiti impact orthograph access handwrit execut semant factor imag concret affect accuraci result suggest thing phonolog consult orthograph access handwrit kind databas sourc secondari data analys tool stimulus construct handwrit research",1
"12","KeywordsMeta-analysis Standardized regression coefficients Effect size ","concealed correlations meta-analysis: a new method for synthesizing standardized regression coefficients","The synthesis of standardized regression coefficients is still a controversial issue in the field of meta-analysis. The difficulty lies in the fact that the standardized regression coefficients belonging to regression models that include different sets of covariates do not represent the same parameter, and thus their direct combination is meaningless. In the present study, a new approach called concealed correlations meta-analysis is proposed that allows for using the common information that standardized regression coefficients from different regression models contain to improve the precision of a combined focal standardized regression coefficient estimate. The performance of this new approach was compared with that of two other approaches: (1) carrying out separate meta-analyses for standardized regression coefficients from studies that used the same regression model, and (2) performing a meta-regression on the focal standardized regression coefficients while including an indicator variable as a moderator indicating the regression model to which each standardized regression coefficient belongs. The comparison was done through a simulation study. The results showed that, as expected, the proposed approach led to more accurate estimates of the combined standardized regression coefficients under both random- and fixed-effect models.","No","metaanalysi standard regress coeffici effect size conceal correl metaanalysi method synthes standard regress coeffici synthesi standard regress coeffici controversi issu field metaanalysi difficulti lie fact standard regress coeffici belong regress model includ set covari repres paramet direct combin meaningless present studi approach call conceal correl metaanalysi propos common inform standard regress coeffici regress model improv precis combin focal standard regress coeffici estim perform approach compar approach carri separ metaanalys standard regress coeffici studi regress model perform metaregress focal standard regress coeffici includ indic variabl moder indic regress model standard regress coeffici belong comparison simul studi result show expect propos approach led accur estim combin standard regress coeffici random fixedeffect model",1

This is particularly clear in the case of prediction models, such as the continuous skip-gram model introduced in Mikolov, Chen, Corrado, and Dean (2013), because these models depend on functionality closely related to the simple Rescorla–Wagner model of discriminant learning in nonhuman animals (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972), which has a rich history within psychology as a model of many animal learning processes.

"14","KeywordsStatistical learning Individual differences Reliability Domain generality Children ","do current statistical learning tasks capture stable individual differences in children? an investigation of task reliability across modality","Do commonly used statistical-learning tasks capture stable individual differences in children? Infants, children, and adults are capable of using statistical learning (SL) to extract information about their environment. Although most studies have looked at group-level performance, a growing literature examines individual differences in SL and their relation to language-learning outcomes: Individuals who are better at SL are expected to show better linguistic abilities. Accordingly, studies have shown positive correlations between SL performance and language outcomes in both children and adults. However, these studies have often used tasks designed to explore group-level performance without modifying them, resulting in psychometric shortcomings that impact reliability in adults (Siegelman, Bogaerts, Christiansen, & Frost in Transactions of the Royal Society B, 372, 20160059, 2017a; Siegelman, Bogaerts, & Frost in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 418–432, 2017b). Even though similar measures are used to assess individual differences in children, no study to date has examined the reliability of these measures in development. This study examined the reliability of common SL measures in both children and adults. It assessed the reliability of three SL tasks (two auditory and one visual) twice (two months apart) in adults and children (mean age 8 years). Although the tasks showed moderate reliability in adults, they did not capture stable individual variation in children. None of the tasks were reliable across sessions, and all showed internal consistency measures well below psychometric standards. These findings raise significant concerns about the use of current SL measures to predict and explain individual differences in development. The article ends with a discussion of possible explanations for the difference in reliability between children and adults.","No","statist learn individu differ reliabl domain general children current statist learn task captur stabl individu differ children investig task reliabl modal common statisticallearn task captur stabl individu differ children infant children adult capabl statist learn sl extract inform environ studi look grouplevel perform grow literatur examin individu differ sl relat languagelearn outcom individu sl expect show linguist abil studi shown posit correl sl perform languag outcom children adult studi task design explor grouplevel perform modifi result psychometr shortcom impact reliabl adult siegelman bogaert christiansen frost transact royal societi a siegelman bogaert frost behavior research method b similar measur assess individu differ children studi date examin reliabl measur develop studi examin reliabl common sl measur children adult assess reliabl sl task auditori visual month adult children age year task show moder reliabl adult captur stabl individu variat children task reliabl session show intern consist measur psychometr standard find rais signific concern current sl measur predict explain individu differ develop articl end discuss explan differ reliabl children adult",1

We reviewed research comparing eye movements during self-categorized episodes of normal versus mindless reading and found little consensus regarding the specific measures that are sensitive to attentional decoupling during mind wandering. To address this issue of inconsistency, we conducted a new, high-powered eye-tracking experiment and considered all previously identified mind-wandering indicators. In our experiment, only three measures (reading time, fixation count, and first-fixation duration) positively predicted self-categorized mindless reading. Aside from these single measures, the word-frequency effect was found to be generally less pronounced during mindless-reading than during normal-reading episodes. To additionally test for convergent validity between the objective and subjective mind-wandering measures, we utilized eye-movement measures as well as thought reports, to examine the effect of metacognitive awareness on mind-wandering behavior. We expected that participants anticipating a difficult comprehension test would mind wander less during reading than would those anticipating an easy test. Although we were able to induce metacognitive expectancies about task difficulty, we found no evidence that these difficulty expectancies affected either subjectively reported or objectively measured mind wandering.","No","mind wander taskunrel thought eye movement read eye give valid studi eyemov measur indic mindless read identifi eyemov measur object indic mind wander work progress review research compar eye movement categor episod normal versus mindless read found consensus specif measur sensit attent decoupl mind wander address issu inconsist conduct highpow eyetrack experi consid previous identifi mindwand indic experi measur read time fixat count fixat durat posit predict categor mindless read singl measur wordfrequ effect found general pronounc mindlessread normalread episod addit test converg valid object subject mindwand measur util eyemov measur thought report examin effect metacognit awar mindwand behavior expect particip anticip difficult comprehens test mind wander read anticip easi test induc metacognit expect task difficulti found evid difficulti expect affect subject report object measur mind wander",1

These feature lists for each concept were then coded into their root word form and affixes (i.e., cat and s for cats) to explore the impact of word form on semantic similarity measures, which are often calculated by comparing concept feature lists (feature overlap). All concept features, coding, and calculated similarity information is provided in a searchable database for easy access and utilization for future researchers when designing experiments that use word stimuli.

A number of unsupervised learning algorithms have been proposed in the last 20 years for these purposes, some of which have been implemented computationally, but whose results remain difficult to compare across papers. We created a tool that is open source, enables reproducible results, and encourages cumulative science in this domain. WordSeg has a modular architecture: It combines a set of corpora description routines, multiple algorithms varying in complexity and cognitive assumptions (including several that were not publicly available, or insufficiently documented), and a rich evaluation package. In the paper, we illustrate the use of this package by analyzing a corpus of child-directed speech in various ways, which further allows us to make recommendations for experimental design of follow-up work. Supplementary materials allow readers to reproduce every result in this paper, and detailed online instructions further enable them to go beyond what we have done. Moreover, the system can be installed within container software that ensures a stable and reliable environment. Finally, by virtue of its modular architecture and transparency, WordSeg can work as an open-source platform, to which other researchers can add their own segmentation algorithms.","No","unsupervis word discoveri languag acquisit natur languag process cumul scienc wordseg standard unsupervis word form segment text basic task languag acquisit involv discov boundari word morphem input basic unit overt segment number unsupervis learn algorithm propos year purpos implement comput result remain difficult compar paper creat tool open sourc enabl reproduc result encourag cumul scienc domain wordseg modular architectur combin set corpora descript routin multipl algorithm vari complex cognit assumpt includ public insuffici document rich evalu packag paper illustr packag analyz corpus childdirect speech way make recommend experiment design follow work supplementari materi reader reproduc result paper detail onlin instruct enabl system instal contain softwar ensur stabl reliabl environ final virtu modular architectur transpar wordseg work opensourc platform research add segment algorithm",1
"19","KeywordsPerceptual strength Norms Regression Psycholinguistic variables ","visual and auditory perceptual strength norms for 3,596 french nouns and their relationship with other psycholinguistic variables","Perceptual experience plays a critical role in the conceptual representation of words. Higher levels of semantic variables such as imageability, concreteness, and sensory experience are generally associated with faster and more accurate word processing. Nevertheless, these variables tend to be assessed mostly on the basis of visual experience. This underestimates the potential contributions of other perceptual modalities. Accordingly, recent evidence has stressed the importance of providing modality-specific perceptual strength norms. In the present study, we developed French Canadian norms of visual and auditory perceptual strength (i.e., the modalities that have major impact on word processing) for 3,596 nouns. We then explored the relationship between these newly developed variables and other lexical, orthographic, and semantic variables. Finally, we demonstrated the contributions of visual and auditory perceptual strength ratings to visual word processing beyond those of other semantic variables related to perceptual experience (e.g., concreteness, imageability, and sensory experience ratings). The ratings developed in this study are a meaningful contribution toward the implementation of new studies that will shed further light on the interaction between linguistic, semantic, and perceptual systems.","No","perceptu strength norm regress psycholinguist variabl visual auditori perceptu strength norm french noun relationship psycholinguist variabl perceptu experi play critic role conceptu represent word higher level semant variabl imag concret sensori experi general faster accur word process variabl tend assess basi visual experi underestim potenti contribut perceptu modal recent evid stress import provid modalityspecif perceptu strength norm present studi develop french canadian norm visual auditori perceptu strength modal major impact word process noun explor relationship newli develop variabl lexic orthograph semant variabl final demonstr contribut visual auditori perceptu strength rate visual word process semant variabl relat perceptu experi concret imag sensori experi rate rate develop studi meaning contribut implement studi shed light interact linguist semant perceptu system",1

Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding how characters should be segmented into logographemes and radicals. This article reports handwriting data for a list of 209 Chinese characters (95 nonphonetic compounds and 114 phonetic compounds) in a copying task. To validate the constituent logographemes and radicals of the target Chinese characters, comparisons among between-radical interstroke intervals (ISIs), between-logographeme ISIs, and within-logographeme ISIs, as well as their interactions with orthographic factors including character frequency, stroke number, and configuration, were conducted using factorial analyses. The results showed that the ISI comparison method is effective in validating the constituent logographemes and radicals in Chinese characters. On the basis of this list of 209 stimuli, another 1,227 Chinese characters that share the same set of radicals with the stimuli were further identified. Their constituent logographemes were deduced accordingly. Altogether, the over 1,000 Chinese characters with validated constituent logographemes will serve as a powerful reference for future psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research. Future potential applications are discussed.","No","databas chines radic logographem valid constitu logographem radic chines charact handwrit data studi shown logographem radic subcharact unit chines charact repres orthograph lexicon function process unit write chines charact consensus charact segment logographem radic articl report handwrit data list chines charact nonphonet compound phonet compound copi task valid constitu logographem radic target chines charact comparison radic interstrok interv isi logographem isi logographem isi interact orthograph factor includ charact frequenc stroke number configur conduct factori analys result show isi comparison method effect valid constitu logographem radic chines charact basi list stimuli chines charact share set radic stimuli identifi constitu logographem deduc altogeth chines charact valid constitu logographem serv power refer futur psycholinguist neurolinguist research futur potenti applic discuss",1

Using comments on the popular social media platform Reddit from January 2006 until September 2017, we showed how changes in the framing of same-sex marriage in public discourse relate to changes in public opinion. We used a topic model to show that the contributions of certain protected-values-based topics to the debate (religious arguments and freedom of opinion) increased prior to the emergence of a public consensus in support of same-sex marriage (Gallup, 2017), and declined afterward. In contrast, the discussion of certain consequentialist topics (the impact of politicians’ stance and same-sex marriage as a matter of policy) showed the opposite pattern. Our results reinforce the meaningfulness of protected values and consequentialism as relevant dimensions for describing public discourse and highlight the usefulness of unsupervised machine-learning methods in tackling questions about social attitude change.","No","protect valu consequenti sex marriag latent dirichlet alloc reddit consequ decad discours sex marriag approach issu len nonnegoti valu increas perceiv intract debat baron spranca organiz behavior human decis process focus concret consequ polici result moder extrem opinion fernbach roger fox sloman psycholog scienc greater likelihood conflict resolut baron leshner journal experiment psycholog appli comment popular social media platform reddit januari septemb show frame sex marriag public discours relat public opinion topic model show contribut protectedvaluesbas topic debat religi argument freedom opinion increas prior emerg public consensus support sex marriag gallup declin afterward contrast discuss consequentialist topic impact politician stanc sex marriag matter polici show opposit pattern result reinforc meaning protect valu consequenti relev dimens describ public discours highlight use unsupervis machinelearn method tackl question social attitud chang",1

Like its predecessor, TAACO 2.0 is a freely available text analysis tool that works on the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems; is housed on a user’s hard drive; is easy to use; and allows for batch processing of text files. TAACO 2.0 includes all the original indices reported for TAACO 1.0, but it adds a number of new indices related to local and global cohesion at the semantic level, reported by latent semantic analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation, and word2vec. The tool also includes a source overlap feature, which calculates lexical and semantic overlap between a source and a response text (i.e., cohesion between the two texts based measures of text relatedness). In the first study in this article, we examined the effects that cohesion features, prompt, essay elaboration, and enhanced cohesion had on expert ratings of text coherence, finding that global semantic similarity as reported by word2vec was an important predictor of coherence ratings. A second study was conducted to examine the source and response indices. In this study we examined whether source overlap between the speaking samples found in the TOEFL-iBT integrated speaking tasks and the responses produced by test-takers was predictive of human ratings of speaking proficiency. The results indicated that the percentage of keywords found in both the source and response and the similarity between the source document and the response, as reported by word2vec, were significant predictors of speaking quality.

Although most listeners seem sensitive to vocal mistuning, little is known about the development of this perceptual ability or how it differs between listeners. Motivated by a lack of suitable preexisting measures, we introduce in this article an adaptive and ecologically valid test of mistuning perception ability. The stimulus material consisted of short excerpts (6 to 12 s in length) from pop music performances (obtained from MedleyDB; Bittner et al., 2014) for which the vocal track was pitch-shifted relative to the instrumental tracks. In a first experiment, 333 listeners were tested on a two-alternative forced choice task that tested discrimination between a pitch-shifted and an unaltered version of the same audio clip. Explanatory item response modeling was then used to calibrate an adaptive version of the test. A subsequent validation experiment applied this adaptive test to 66 participants with a broad range of musical expertise, producing evidence of the test’s reliability, convergent validity, and divergent validity. The test is ready to be deployed as an experimental tool and should make an important contribution to our understanding of the human ability to judge mistuning.","No","pitch percept music abil pitch accuraci goldmsi mistun percept test measur instrument import aspect perceiv qualiti vocal music degre vocalist sing tune listen sensit vocal mistun develop perceptu abil differ listen motiv lack suitabl preexist measur introduc articl adapt ecolog valid test mistun percept abil stimulus materi consist short excerpt length pop music perform obtain medleydb bittner al vocal track pitchshift relat instrument track experi listen test altern forc choic task test discrimin pitchshift unalt version audio clip explanatori item respons model calibr adapt version test subsequ valid experi appli adapt test particip broad rang music expertis produc evid test reliabl converg valid diverg valid test readi deploy experiment tool make import contribut understand human abil judg mistun",1

This involves understanding changes in what words meant, how words were used, and how these changes may have responded to changes in the environment, such as in healthcare, wealth disparity, and war. Here we make available a tool, the Macroscope, for studying historical changes in language over the last two centuries. The Macroscope uses over 155 billion words of historical text, which will grow as we include new historical corpora, and derives word properties from frequency-of-usage and co-occurrence patterns over time. Using co-occurrence patterns, the Macroscope can track changes in semantics, allowing researchers to identify semantically stable and unstable words in historical text and providing quantitative information about changes in a word’s valence, arousal, and concreteness, as well as information about new properties, such as semantic drift. The Macroscope provides information about both the local and global properties of words, as well as information about how these properties change over time, allowing researchers to visualize and download data in order to make inferences about historical psychology. Although quantitative historical psychology represents a largely new field of study, we see this work as complementing a wealth of other historical investigations, offering new insights and new approaches to understanding existing theory.

"27","KeywordsPupillometry Executive functioning Arousal Cognitive load Psychophysics ","the human task-evoked pupillary response function is linear: implications for baseline response scaling in pupillometry","The human task-evoked pupillary response provides a sensitive physiological index of the intensity and online resource demands of numerous cognitive processes (e.g., memory retrieval, problem solving, or target detection). Cognitive pupillometry is a well-established technique that relies upon precise measurement of these subtle response functions. Baseline variability of pupil diameter is a complex artifact that typically necessitates mathematical correction. A methodological paradox within pupillometry is that linear and nonlinear forms of baseline scaling both remain accepted baseline correction techniques, despite yielding highly disparate results. The task-evoked pupillary response (TEPR) could potentially scale nonlinearly, similar to autonomic functions such as heart rate, in which the amplitude of an evoked response diminishes as the baseline rises. Alternatively, the TEPR could scale similarly to the cortical hemodynamic response, as a linear function that is independent of its baseline. However, the TEPR cannot scale both linearly and nonlinearly. Our aim was to adjudicate between linear and nonlinear scaling of human TEPR. We manipulated baseline pupil size by modulating the illuminance in the testing room as participants heard abrupt pure-tone transitions (Exp. 1) or visually monitored word lists (Exp. 2). Phasic pupillary responses scaled according to a linear function across all lighting (dark, mid, bright) and task (tones, words) conditions, demonstrating that the TEPR is independent of its baseline amplitude. We discuss methodological implications and identify a need to reevaluate past pupillometry studies.","No","pupillometri execut function arous cognit load psychophys human taskevok pupillari respons function linear implic baselin respons scale pupillometri human taskevok pupillari respons sensit physiolog index intens onlin resourc demand numer cognit process memori retriev problem solv target detect cognit pupillometri establish techniqu reli precis measur subtl respons function baselin variabl pupil diamet complex artifact typic necessit mathemat correct methodolog paradox pupillometri linear nonlinear form baselin scale remain accept baselin correct techniqu yield high dispar result taskevok pupillari respons tepr potenti scale nonlinear similar autonom function heart rate amplitud evok respons diminish baselin rise altern tepr scale similar cortic hemodynam respons linear function independ baselin tepr scale linear nonlinear aim adjud linear nonlinear scale human tepr manipul baselin pupil size modul illumin test room particip heard abrupt pureton transit exp visual monitor word list exp phasic pupillari respons scale linear function light dark mid bright task tone word condit demonstr tepr independ baselin amplitud discuss methodolog implic identifi reevalu past pupillometri studi",1

The Glasgow Norms are unique in several respects. First, the corpus itself is relatively large, while simultaneously providing norms across a substantial number of lexical dimensions. Second, for any given subset of words, the same participants provided ratings across all nine dimensions (33 participants/word, on average). Third, two novel dimensions—semantic size and gender association—are included. Finally, the corpus contains a set of 379 ambiguous words that are presented either alone (e.g., toast) or with information that selects an alternative sense (e.g., toast (bread), toast (speech)). The relationships between the dimensions of the Glasgow Norms were initially investigated by assessing their correlations. In addition, a principal component analysis revealed four main factors, accounting for 82% of the variance (Visualization, Emotion, Salience, and Exposure). The validity of the Glasgow Norms was established via comparisons of our ratings to 18 different sets of current psycholinguistic norms. The dimension of size was tested with megastudy data, confirming findings from past studies that have explicitly examined this variable. Alternative senses of ambiguous words (i.e., disambiguated forms), when discordant on a given dimension, seemingly led to appropriately distinct ratings. Informal comparisons between the ratings of ambiguous words and of their alternative senses showed different patterns that likely depended on several factors (the number of senses, their relative strengths, and the rating scales themselves). Overall, the Glasgow Norms provide a valuable resource—in particular, for researchers investigating the role of word recognition in language comprehension.","No","psycholinguist norm arous valenc domin concret imag familiar age acquisit semant size gender associ glasgow norm rate word scale glasgow norm set normat rate english word psycholinguist dimens arous valenc domin concret imag familiar age acquisit semant size gender associ glasgow norm uniqu respect corpus larg simultan provid norm substanti number lexic dimens subset word particip provid rate dimens participantsword averag dimens semant size gender associ includ final corpus set ambigu word present toast inform select altern sens toast bread toast speech relationship dimens glasgow norm initi investig assess correl addit princip compon analysi reveal main factor account varianc visual emot salienc exposur valid glasgow norm establish comparison rate set current psycholinguist norm dimens size test megastudi data confirm find past studi explicit examin variabl altern sens ambigu word disambigu form discord dimens seem led appropri distinct rate inform comparison rate ambigu word altern sens show pattern depend factor number sens relat strength rate scale glasgow norm provid valuabl resourc research investig role word recognit languag comprehens",1

The approach offers a way to capture motion adapted from the film industry in which markers placed on the skin of the face can be tracked with a pattern-matching algorithm. The method records and postprocesses raw facial movement data (coordinates per frame) of distinctly placed markers and is intended for use in facial expression research (e.g., microexpressions) in laboratory settings. Due to the explicit use of specifically placed, artificial markers, the procedure offers the simultaneous measurement of several emotionally relevant markers in a (psychometrically) objective and artifact-free way, even for facial regions without natural landmarks (e.g., the cheeks). In addition, the proposed procedure is fully based on open-source software and is transparent at every step of data processing. Two worked examples demonstrate the practicability of the proposed procedure: In Study 1(N= 39), the participants were instructed to show the emotions happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger, and in Study 2 (N= 113), they were asked to present both a neutral face and the emotions happiness, disgust, and fear. Study 2 involved the simultaneous tracking of 14 markers for approximately 12 min per participant with a time resolution of 33 ms. The measured facial movements corresponded closely to the assumptions of established measurement instruments (EMFACS, FACSAID, Friesen & Ekman, 1983; Ekman & Hager, 2002).

Although the lab provides excellent facilities for controlled testing, some questions are best explored by collecting information that is difficult to obtain in the lab. The vast amounts of data now available to researchers can be a valuable resource in this respect. By incorporating this new realm of data and translating it into traditional laboratory methods, we can expand the reach of the lab into the wilderness of human society. This study demonstrates how the troves of linguistic data generated by humans can be used to test theories about cognition and representation. It also suggests how similar interpretations can be made of other research in cognition. The first case tests a long-standing prediction of Gentner’s natural partition hypothesis: that verb meaning is more subject to change due to the textual context in which it appears than is the meaning of nouns. Within a diachronic corpus, verbs and other relational words indeed showed more evidence of semantic change than did concrete nouns. In the second case, corpus statistics were employed to empirically support the existence of phonesthemes—nonmorphemic units of sound that are associated with aspects of meaning. A third study also supported this measure, by demonstrating that it corresponds with performance in a lab experiment. Neither of these questions can be adequately explored without the use of big data in the form of linguistic corpora.","No","corpus statist big data semant chang represent phonesthem tame big data appli experiment method naturalist data set psycholog research tradit focus labbas experi test theori hypothes lab excel facil control test question explor collect inform difficult obtain lab vast amount data research valuabl resourc respect incorpor realm data translat tradit laboratori method expand reach lab wilder human societi studi demonstr trove linguist data generat human test theori cognit represent suggest similar interpret made research cognit case test longstand predict gentner natur partit hypothesi verb mean subject chang due textual context appear mean noun diachron corpus verb relat word show evid semant chang concret noun case corpus statist employ empir support exist phonesthem nonmorphem unit sound aspect mean studi support measur demonstr correspond perform lab experi question adequ explor big data form linguist corpora",1

However, there has been a lack of normed studies describing generalizable principles in gesture production and in comprehension of the mappings of different types of iconic strategies (i.e., modes of representation; Müller, 2013). In Study 1 we elicited silent gestures in order to explore the implementation of different types of iconic representation (i.e., acting, representing, drawing, and personification) to express concepts across five semantic domains. In Study 2 we investigated the degree of meaning transparency (i.e., iconicity ratings) of the gestures elicited in Study 1. We found systematicity in the gestural forms of 109 concepts across all participants, with different types of iconicity aligning with specific semantic domains: Acting was favored for actions and manipulable objects, drawing for nonmanipulable objects, and personification for animate entities. Interpretation of gesture–meaning transparency was modulated by the interaction between mode of representation and semantic domain, with some couplings being more transparent than others: Acting yielded higher ratings for actions, representing for object-related concepts, personification for animate entities, and drawing for nonmanipulable entities. This study provides mapping principles that may extend to all forms of manual communication (gesture and sign). This database includes a list of the most systematic silent gestures in the group of participants, a notation of the form of each gesture based on four features (hand configuration, orientation, placement, and movement), each gesture’s mode of representation, iconicity ratings, and professionally filmed videos that can be used for experimental and clinical endeavors.","No","icon silent gestur mode represent percept icon norm databas systemat map semant categori type icon represent manual modal norm databas silent gestur unpreced number empir studi shown icon gestur mimic sensorimotor attribut refer contribut signific languag acquisit percept process lack norm studi describ generaliz principl gestur product comprehens map type icon strategi mode represent ller studi elicit silent gestur order explor implement type icon represent act repres draw personif express concept semant domain studi investig degre mean transpar icon rate gestur elicit studi found systemat gestur form concept particip type icon align specif semant domain act favor action manipul object draw nonmanipul object personif anim entiti interpret gestur mean transpar modul interact mode represent semant domain coupl transpar act yield higher rate action repres objectrel concept personif anim entiti draw nonmanipul entiti studi map principl extend form manual communic gestur sign databas includ list systemat silent gestur group particip notat form gestur base featur hand configur orient placement movement gestur mode represent icon rate profession film video experiment clinic endeavor",1

This article introduces the spreadr R package, which can implement spreading activation within a specified network structure. The algorithmic method implemented in the spreadr subroutines follows the approach described in Vitevitch, Ercal, and Adagarla (Frontiers in Psychology, 2, 369, 2011), who viewed activation as a fixed cognitive resource that could “spread” among connected nodes in a network. Three sets of simulations were conducted using the package. The first set of simulations successfully reproduced the results reported in Vitevitch et al. (Frontiers in Psychology, 2, 369, 2011), who showed that a simple mechanism of spreading activation could account for the clustering coefficient effect in spoken word recognition. The second set of simulations showed that the same mechanism could be extended to account for higher false alarm rates for low clustering coefficient words in a false memory task.

A rate-limiting factor in answering such questions is the challenge of recruiting rare DP participants. Although self-reported experiences have long played a role in efforts to identify DPs, much remains unknown about how such self-reports can or should contribute to screening or diagnosis. Here, in a large, population-based web sample, we investigated the effectiveness of self-report, used on its own, as a screen to identify individuals who will ultimately fail, at a conventional cutoff, the two types of objective tests that are most commonly used to confirm DP diagnoses: the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) and the famous faces memory test (FFMT). We used a highly reliable questionnaire (alpha = .91), the Cambridge Face Memory Questionnaire (CFMQ), and revealed strong validity via high correlations of .44 with the CFMT and .52 with the FFMT. However, cutoff analyses revealed that no CFMQ score yielded a clinical-grade combination of sensitivity and positive predictive value in enough individuals to support using it alone as a DP diagnostic or screening tool. This result was replicated in an analysis of data from the widely used PI20 questionnaire, a 20-question self-assessment of facial recognition similar in form to the CFMQ. We therefore recommend that screens for DP should, wherever possible, include objective as well as subjective assessment tools.","No","report abil individu differ face recognit screen prosopagnosia metacognit report face recognit high valid high discrimin prosopagnosialevel perform object assess sever development deficit face recognit abil development prosopagnosia dp vigor studi past decad question remain unansw origin natur social consequ ratelimit factor answer question challeng recruit rare dp particip report experi long play role effort identifi dps remain unknown report contribut screen diagnosi larg populationbas web sampl investig effect report screen identifi individu ultim fail convent cutoff type object test common confirm dp diagnos cambridg face memori test cfmt famous face memori test ffmt high reliabl questionnair alpha cambridg face memori questionnair cfmq reveal strong valid high correl cfmt ffmt cutoff analys reveal cfmq score yield clinicalgrad combin sensit posit predict individu support dp diagnost screen tool result replic analysi data wide pi questionnair question assess facial recognit similar form cfmq recommend screen dp includ object subject assess tool",1

The method is based on moving the request for honest responding, often included in the introduction to surveys, to the questioning phase of the survey. Over a quarter of Internet survey participants do not read survey instructions, and therefore, instead of asking respondents to answer honestly, they were asked whether they responded honestly. Posing the honesty message in the form of questions on honest responding draws attention to the message, increases the processing of it, and puts subsequent questions in context with the questions on honest responding. In three studies (nStudy I = 475, nStudy II = 1,015, nStudy III = 899), we tested whether presenting the questions on honest responding before questions on desirable and undesirable behavior could increase the honesty of responses, under the assumption that less attribution of desirable behavior and/or admitting to more undesirable behavior could be taken to indicate more honest responses. In all studies the participants who were presented with the questions on honest responding before questions on the target behavior produced, on average, significantly less socially desirable responses, though the effect sizes were small in all cases (Cohen’s d ranging between 0.02 and 0.28 for single items, and from 0.17 to 0.34 for sum scores). The overall findings and the possible mechanisms behind the influence of the questions concerning honest responding on subsequent questions are discussed, and suggestions are made for future research.","No","question honest respond social desir respond sensit question report internet survey question honest respond articl present method reduc social desir respond internet report desir undesir behavior method base move request honest respond includ introduct survey question phase survey quarter internet survey particip read survey instruct respond answer honest ask respond honest pose honesti messag form question honest respond draw attent messag increas process put subsequ question context question honest respond studi nstudi nstudi ii nstudi iii test present question honest respond question desir undesir behavior increas honesti respons assumpt attribut desir behavior admit undesir behavior honest respons studi particip present question honest respond question target behavior produc averag signific social desir respons effect size small case cohen rang singl item sum score find mechan influenc question honest respond subsequ question discuss suggest made futur research",1

It is unclear, however, how to statistically quantify the amount of signal present in CIs, which limits the interpretability of these images. In this article, we propose a novel metric, infoVal, which assesses informational value relative to a resampled random distribution and can be interpreted like a z score. In the first part, we define the infoVal metric and show, through simulations, that it adheres to typical Type I error rates under various task conditions (internal validity). In the second part, we show that the metric correlates with markers of data quality in empirical reverse-correlation data, such as the subjective recognizability, objective discriminability, and test–retest reliability of the CIs (convergent validity). In the final part, we demonstrate how the infoVal metric can be used to compare the informational value of reverse-correlation datasets, by comparing data acquired online with data acquired in a controlled lab environment. We recommend a new standard of good practice in which researchers assess the infoVal scores of reverse-correlation data in order to ensure that they do not read signal in CIs where no signal is present. The infoVal metric is implemented in the open-source rcicr R package, to facilitate its adoption.","No","revers correl data qualiti reliabl onlin experi social psycholog quantifi inform classif imag revers correl influenti psychophys paradigm particip respons random vari imag build classif imag ci common interpret visual particip mental represent unclear statist quantifi amount signal present cis limit interpret imag articl propos metric infov assess inform relat resampl random distribut interpret score part defin infov metric show simul adher typic type error rate task condit intern valid part show metric correl marker data qualiti empir reversecorrel data subject recogniz object discrimin test retest reliabl cis converg valid final part demonstr infov metric compar inform reversecorrel dataset compar data acquir onlin data acquir control lab environ recommend standard good practic research assess infov score reversecorrel data order ensur read signal cis signal present infov metric implement opensourc rcicr packag facilit adopt",1

Researchers have studied the effects of BOI in order to investigate the relationships between sensorimotor and cognitive processes. Such efforts could be improved, however, by the availability of more extensive BOI norms. In the present work, we collected BOI ratings for over 9,000 words. These new norms show good reliability and validity and have extensive overlap with the words used both in other lexical and semantic norms and in the available behavioral megastudies (e.g., the English Lexicon Project, Balota, Yap, Cortese, Hutchison, Kessler, & Loftis in Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007; and the Calgary Semantic Decision Project, Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017). In analyses using the new BOI norms, we found that high-BOI words tended to be more concrete, more graspable, and more strongly associated with sensory, haptic, and visual experience than are low-BOI words. When we used the new norms to predict response latencies and accuracy data from the behavioral megastudies, we found that BOI was a stronger predictor of responses in the semantic decision task than in the lexical decision task. These findings are consistent with a dynamic, multidimensional account of lexical semantics. The norms described here should be useful for future research examining the effects of sensorimotor experience on performance in tasks involving word stimuli.","No","bodyobject interact lexic decis task semant decis task sensorimotor process word rate word recognit quantifi sensorimotor experi bodi object interact rate english word rate bodi object interact boi measur eas human bodi interact word refer research studi effect boi order investig relationship sensorimotor cognit process effort improv avail extens boi norm present work collect boi rate word norm show good reliabl valid extens overlap word lexic semant norm behavior megastudi english lexicon project balota yap cortes hutchison kessler lofti behavior research method calgari semant decis project pexman heard lloyd yap behavior research method analys boi norm found highboi word tend concret graspabl strong sensori haptic visual experi lowboi word norm predict respons latenc accuraci data behavior megastudi found boi stronger predictor respons semant decis task lexic decis task find consist dynam multidimension account lexic semant norm futur research examin effect sensorimotor experi perform task involv word stimuli",1

Language samples were collected from the social media website Reddit, drawing on posts to discussion groups focusing on different kinds of mental illness (clinical subreddits), as well as on posts to discussion groups focusing on nonmental health topics (nonclinical subreddits). As expected, words drawn from the clinical subreddits could be used to distinguish several kinds of mental illness (ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression). Interestingly, words drawn from the nonclinical subreddits (e.g., travel, cooking, cars) could also be used to distinguish different categories of mental illness, implying that the impact of mental illness spills over into topics unrelated to mental illness. Most importantly, words derived from the nonclinical subreddits predicted future postings to clinical subreddits, implying that everyday language contains signal about the likelihood of future mental illness, possibly before people are aware of their mental health condition. Finally, whereas models trained on clinical subreddits learned to focus on words indicating disorder-specific symptoms, models trained to predict future mental illness learned to focus on words indicating life stress, suggesting that kinds of features that are predictive of mental illness may change over time.

In the present study we collected normative data for 160 Chinese–English word pairs. Participants completed three study–test cycles, followed by metacognitive judgments on their learning experience. For each pair, we report recall performance, recall latency, ease of learning, and judgments of learning. A simultaneous multiple regression analysis with frequency (of both the English word and the Chinese character), word length (English), and number of strokes (Chinese) as predictors revealed that a greater number of strokes (or higher visual complexity) for the Chinese characters predicted lower target recall.","No","pair associ chines english translat cu recal episod memori normat data chineseenglish pair associ pairedassoci learn common paradigm studi human memori studi particip typic told learn foreign languag english translat swahili english lithuanian english pair limit foreign languag english translat norm foreign languag base alphabet write system prevent research general find languag base logograph write system present studi collect normat data chines english word pair particip complet studi test cycl metacognit judgment learn experi pair report recal perform recal latenc eas learn judgment learn simultan multipl regress analysi frequenc english word chines charact word length english number stroke chines predictor reveal greater number stroke higher visual complex chines charact predict lower target recal",1

As listeners, we make use of background knowledge — about the speaker, about entities and concepts, about previous utterances — in order to infer the speaker’s intended meaning. But even if there is consensus that these sources of information are a necessary component of linguistic communication, it is another matter entirely to provide a thorough, quantitative accounting for context’s interaction with language. When does context matter? What kinds of context matter in which kinds of domains? The empirical investigation of these questions is inhibited by a number of factors: the challenge of quantifying language, the boundless combinations of domains and types of context to be measured, and the challenge of selecting and applying a given construct to natural language data. In response to these factors, we introduce and demonstrate a methodological framework for testing the importance of contextual information in inferring speaker intentions from text. We apply Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks, a standard for representing language in its natural, sequential state, and conduct a set of experiments for predicting the persuasive intentions of speakers in political debates using different combinations of text and background information about the speaker.

"44",NA,"introduction to special issue. beyond the lab: using big data to discover principles of cognition","Like many other scientific disciplines, psychological science has felt the impact of the big-data revolution. This impact arises from the meeting of three forces: data availability, data heterogeneity, and data analyzability. In terms of data availability, consider that for decades, researchers relied on the Brown Corpus of about one million words (Kučera & Francis, 1969). Modern resources, in contrast, are larger by six orders of magnitude (e.g., Google’s 1T corpus) and are available in a growing number of languages. About 240 billion photos have been uploaded to Facebook,1 and Instagram receives over 100 million new photos each day.2 The large-scale digitization of these data has made it possible in principle to analyze and aggregate these resources on a previously unimagined scale. Heterogeneity refers to the availability of different types of data. For example, recent progress in automatic image recognition is owed not just to improvements in algorithms and hardware, but arguably more to the ability to merge large collections of images with linguistic labels (produced by crowdsourced human taggers) that serve as training data to the algorithms. Making use of heterogeneous data sources often depends on their standardization. For example, the ability to combine demographic and grammatical data about thousands of languages led to the finding that languages spoken by more people have simpler morphologies (Lupyan & Dale, 2010). The ability to combine these data types would have been substantially more difficult without the existence of standardized language and country codes that could be used to merge the different data sources. Finally, analyzability must be ensured, for without appropriate tools to process and analyze different types of data, the “data” are merely bytes.","No","introduct special issu lab big data discov principl cognit scientif disciplin psycholog scienc felt impact bigdata revolut impact aris meet forc data avail data heterogen data analyz term data avail decad research reli brown corpus million word ku era franci modern resourc contrast larger order magnitud googl t corpus grow number languag billion photo upload facebook instagram receiv million photo day largescal digit data made principl analyz aggreg resourc previous unimagin scale heterogen refer avail type data recent progress automat imag recognit owe improv algorithm hardwar arguabl abil merg larg collect imag linguist label produc crowdsourc human tagger serv train data algorithm make heterogen data sourc depend standard abil combin demograph grammat data thousand languag led find languag spoken peopl simpler morpholog lupyan dale abil combin data type substanti difficult exist standard languag countri code merg data sourc final analyz ensur tool process analyz type data data byte",1

The uncertainty due to sampling variability in the norming phase is ignored. To express uncertainty due to norming, we propose a flexible method that is applicable in continuous norming and allows for a variety of score distributions, using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS; Rigby & Stasinopoulos, 2005). We assessed the performance of this method in a simulation study, by examining the quality of the resulting CIs. We varied the population model, procedure of estimating the CI, confidence level, sample size, value of the predictor, extremity of the test score, and type of variance-covariance matrix. The results showed that good quality of the CIs could be achieved in most conditions. The method is illustrated using normative data of the SON-R 6-40 test. We recommend test developers to use this approach to arrive at CIs, and thus properly express the uncertainty due to norm sampling fluctuations, in the context of continuous norming. Adopting this approach will help (e.g., clinical) practitioners to obtain a fair picture of the person assessed.","No","continu norm gamlss boxcox power exponenti distribut posterior simul psycholog test improv confid interv norm test score includ uncertainti due sampl variabl test publish provid confid interv cis norm test score reflect uncertainti due unreli test uncertainti due sampl variabl norm phase express uncertainti due norm propos flexibl method applic continu norm varieti score distribut general addit model locat scale shape gamlss rigbi stasinopoulo assess perform method simul studi examin qualiti result cis vari popul model procedur estim ci confid level sampl size predictor extrem test score type variancecovari matrix result show good qualiti cis achiev condit method illustr normat data son test recommend test develop approach arriv cis proper express uncertainti due norm sampl fluctuat context continu norm adopt approach clinic practition obtain fair pictur person assess",1

We modeled individual concepts (e.g., banana, bottle) as graph-theoretical networks, in which properties (e.g., yellow, sweet) were represented as nodes and their associations as edges. In this framework, networks capture within-concept statistics that reflect how properties relate to one another across instances of a concept. We extracted formal measures of these networks that capture different aspects of network structure, and explored whether a concept’s network structure relates to its flexibility of use. To do so, we compared network measures to a text-based measure of semantic diversity, as well as to empirical data from a figurative-language task and an alternative-uses task. We found that network-based measures were predictive of the text-based and empirical measures of flexible concept use, highlighting the ability of this approach to formally capture relevant characteristics of conceptual structure. Conceptual flexibility is a fundamental attribute of the cognitive and semantic systems, and in this proof of concept we reveal that variations in concept representation and use can be formally understood in terms of the informational content and topology of concept networks.","No","conceptu knowledg conceptu flexibl network scienc implement concept network model concept thing instanti form depend context suggest degre flexibl conceptu system propos featurebas network model captur predict flexibl model individu concept banana bottl graphtheoret network properti yellow sweet repres node associ edg framework network captur concept statist reflect properti relat instanc concept extract formal measur network captur aspect network structur explor concept network structur relat flexibl compar network measur textbas measur semant divers empir data figurativelanguag task altern task found networkbas measur predict textbas empir measur flexibl concept highlight abil approach formal captur relev characterist conceptu structur conceptu flexibl fundament attribut cognit semant system proof concept reveal variat concept represent formal understood term inform content topolog concept network",1

During group interactions, members take on different roles within the discussion. Roles have distinct patterns of behavioral engagement (i.e., active or passive, leading or following), contribution characteristics (i.e., providing new information or echoing given material), and social orientation (i.e., individual or group). Different combinations of roles can produce characteristically different group outcomes, and thus can be either less or more productive with regard to collective goals. In online collaborative-learning environments, this can lead to better or worse learning outcomes for the individual participants. In this study, we propose and validate a novel approach for detecting emergent roles from participants’ contributions and patterns of interaction. Specifically, we developed a group communication analysis (GCA) by combining automated computational linguistic techniques with analyses of the sequential interactions of online group communication. GCA was applied to three large collaborative interaction datasets (participant N = 2,429, group N = 3,598). Cluster analyses and linear mixed-effects modeling were used to assess the validity of the GCA approach and the influence of learner roles on student and group performance. The results indicated that participants’ patterns of linguistic coordination and cohesion are representative of the roles that individuals play in collaborative discussions. More broadly, GCA provides a framework for researchers to explore the micro intra- and interpersonal patterns associated with participants’ roles and the sociocognitive processes related to successful collaboration.","No","group communic analysi social role group interact comput linguist group communic analysi comput linguist approach detect sociocognit role multiparti interact role import concept understand human sociocognit behavior group interact member role discuss role distinct pattern behavior engag activ passiv lead contribut characterist provid inform echo materi social orient individu group combin role produc characterist group outcom product regard collect goal onlin collaborativelearn environ lead wors learn outcom individu particip studi propos valid approach detect emerg role particip contribut pattern interact specif develop group communic analysi gca combin autom comput linguist techniqu analys sequenti interact onlin group communic gca appli larg collabor interact dataset particip group cluster analys linear mixedeffect model assess valid gca approach influenc learner role student group perform result particip pattern linguist coordin cohes repres role individu play collabor discuss broad gca framework research explor micro intra interperson pattern particip role sociocognit process relat success collabor",1

Processing tends to be facilitated for words with high as compared with low BOI, across a wide variety of tasks. Such effects have been referenced in debates over the nature of semantic representations, but their theoretical import has been limited by the fact that BOI is a fairly coarse measure of sensorimotor experience with words’ referents. In the present study, we collected ratings for 621 words on seven semantic dimensions (graspability, ease of pantomime, number of actions, animacy, size, danger, and usefulness), in order to investigate which attributes are most strongly related to BOI ratings and to lexical–semantic processing. BOI ratings were obtained from previous norming studies (Bennett, Burnett, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 43, 1100–1109, 2011; Tillotson, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 40, 1075–1078, 2008), and measures of lexical–semantic processing were obtained from previous behavioral megastudies involving either the semantic categorization task (concrete/abstract decision; Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017) or the lexical decision task (Balota et al., Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007). The results showed that the motor dimensions of graspability, ease of pantomime, and number of actions were all related to BOI, and that these dimensions together explained more variance in semantic processing than did the BOI ratings alone. These ratings will be useful for researchers who wish to study how different kinds of bodily interactions influence lexical–semantic processing and cognition.","No","bodyobject interact semant decis task lexic decis task motor rate visual word recognit grip sensorimotor effect lexic semant process strategi research investig role sensorimotor inform lexic semant process examin effect word rate bodi object interact boi eas human bodi interact word refer process facilit word high compar low boi wide varieti task effect referenc debat natur semant represent theoret import limit fact boi fair coars measur sensorimotor experi word refer present studi collect rate word semant dimens graspabl eas pantomim number action animaci size danger use order investig attribut strong relat boi rate lexic semant process boi rate obtain previous norm studi bennett burnett siakaluk pexman behavior research method tillotson siakaluk pexman behavior research method measur lexic semant process obtain previous behavior megastudi involv semant categor task concreteabstract decis pexman heard lloyd yap behavior research method lexic decis task balota al behavior research method result show motor dimens graspabl eas pantomim number action relat boi dimens explain varianc semant process boi rate rate research studi kind bodili interact influenc lexic semant process cognit",1

In the present study, we aimed to build on this work and demonstrate that there is a large and systematic bias in the use of personal names in the natural-language environment, such that male names are much more prevalent than female names. This bias holds over an analysis of billions of words of text, subcategorized into different genres within fiction novels, nonfiction books, and subtitles from television and film. Additionally, we showed that this bias holds across time, with more recent work displaying the same patterns as work published tens or hundreds of years previously. Finally, we showed that the main cause of the bias comes from male authors perpetuating the bias toward male names, with female authors showing a much smaller bias.

Moreover, this thresholding is largely left for the end user. Here we present and develop gazeNet, a new framework for creating event detectors that do not require hand-crafted signal features or signal thresholding. It employs an end-to-end deep learning approach, which takes raw eye-tracking data as input and classifies it into fixations, saccades and post-saccadic oscillations. Our method thereby challenges an established tacit assumption that hand-crafted features are necessary in the design of event detection algorithms. The downside of the deep learning approach is that a large amount of training data is required. We therefore first develop a method to augment hand-coded data, so that we can strongly enlarge the data set used for training, minimizing the time spent on manual coding.

It has been proposed that this spread took place alongside with that of Bantu languages. In eastern and southeastern Africa, it is also linked to the Early Iron Age. From the beginning of the last millennium BC, cereal agriculture spread rapidly from the Great Lakes area eastwards to the East African coast, and southwards to northeastern South Africa.

The stability assumptions of the reading process suggest that the cognitive system resolves this switching between two tasks quickly. Here, we present an alternative language-game hypothesis (LGH) of reading that begins by treating reading as a softly-assembled process and that assumes, instead of stability, context-sensitive flexibility of the reading process.

This evidence, however, is based on a specific set of speeches of US members of Congress and UK members of Parliament. This raises the question whether the relationship between ideology and linguistic complexity is a more general phenomenon or specific to this small group of politicians. To address this question, this paper analyzes 381,609 speeches given by politicians from five parliaments, by twelve European prime ministers, as well as speeches from party congresses over time and across countries. Our results replicate and generalize earlier findings: speakers from culturally liberal parties use more complex language than speakers from culturally conservative parties. Economic left-right differences, on the other hand, are not systematically linked to linguistic complexity.

However, the extent to which the lexical and the syntactic levels of representations interact during second language (L2) sentence processing and how those interactions are modulated by L2 proficiency remain unclear. This paper aimed to directly address these issues by using an online technique (eye-tracking) that is highly sensitive to the lexical and syntactic processes involved in sentence reading. To that purpose, native-speakers of European Portuguese (EP) learning English as L2 at intermediate and advanced levels of proficiency were asked to silently read temporally ambiguous L2 relative clause (RC) sentences disambiguated with a High-Attachment (HA) or Low-Attachment (LA) strategy while their eye-movements were monitored.

This is especially so in clinical populations.

Stuttering is often related to issues in the speech production system; however, the presence and extent of a speech perception deficit is less clear. This study aimed to investigate the speech perception of children who stutter (CWS) using the categorical perception paradigm to examine their ability to categorize different acoustic variations of speech sounds into the same or different phonemic categories. In this study, 15 CWS and 16 children who do not stutter (CWNS) completed identification and discrimination tasks involving acoustic variations of Cantonese speech sounds in three stimulus contexts: consonants (voice onset times, VOTs), lexical tones, and vowels.

We ask whether sequential or hierarchical information guides the expectations that a human listener forms about a word‚Äôs part-of-speech when simply listening to every-day language. We compare the predictions of three computational models against electroencephalography signals recorded from human participants who listen passively to an audiobook story.
