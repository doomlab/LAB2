"1","KeywordsNonlinear mixed-effects location scale model Verbal learning Intra-individual variability Bayesian inference ","a bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects location scale model for learning","We present a Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects location scale model (NL-MELSM). The NL-MELSM allows for fitting nonlinear functions to the location, or individual means, and the scale, or within-person variance. Specifically, in the context of learning, this model allows the within-person variance to follow a nonlinear trajectory, where it can be determined whether variability reduces during learning. It incorporates a sub-model that can predict nonlinear parameters for both the location and scale. This specification estimates random effects for all nonlinear location and scale parameters that are drawn from a common multivariate distribution. This allows estimation of covariances among the random effects, within and across the location and the scale. These covariances offer new insights into the interplay between individual mean structures and intra-individual variability in nonlinear parameters. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only for ease of estimation but also for inference because it provides the necessary and consistent information for use in psychological applications, such as model selection and hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model, we use data from 333 individuals, consisting of three age groups, who participated in five learning trials that assessed verbal memory. In an exploratory context, we demonstrate that fitting a nonlinear function to the within-person variance, and allowing for individual variation therein, improves predictive accuracy compared to customary modeling techniques (e.g., assuming constant variance). We conclude by discussing the usefulness, limitations, and future directions of the NL-MELSM.","No"," nonlinear mixed effects location scale model verbal learning intra individual variability bayesian inference bayesian nonlinear mixed effects location scale model learning present bayesian nonlinear mixed effects location scale model nl melsm nl melsm fitting nonlinear functions location individual means scale person variance specifically context learning model person variance follow nonlinear trajectory determined variability reduces learning incorporates model predict nonlinear parameters location scale specification estimates random effects nonlinear location scale parameters drawn common multivariate distribution estimation covariances random effects location scale covariances offer insights interplay individual structures intra individual variability nonlinear parameters fully bayesian approach ease estimation inference consistent information psychological applications model selection hypothesis testing illustrate model data individuals consisting age groups participated learning trials assessed verbal memory exploratory context demonstrate fitting nonlinear function person variance allowing individual variation improves predictive accuracy compared customary modeling techniques assuming constant variance conclude discussing usefulness limitations future directions nl melsm",0

Advancing theories of ambiguity resolution is important for any general theory of language processing, and for resolving inconsistencies in observed ambiguity effects across experimental tasks. Focusing on homonyms (words such as bank with unrelated meanings EDGE OF A RIVER vs. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION), the present work advances theories and methods for estimating the relative frequency of their meanings, a factor that shapes observed ambiguity effects. We develop a new method for estimating meaning frequency based on the meaning of a homonym evoked in lines of movie and television subtitles according to human raters. We also replicate and extend a measure of meaning frequency derived from the classification of free associates. We evaluate the internal consistency of these measures, compare them to published estimates based on explicit ratings of each meaning’s frequency, and compare each set of norms in predicting performance in lexical and semantic decision mega-studies. All measures have high internal consistency and show agreement, but each is also associated with unique variance, which may be explained by integrating cognitive theories of memory with the demands of different experimental methodologies. To derive frequency estimates, we collected manual classifications of 533 homonyms over 50,000 lines of subtitles, and of 357 homonyms across over 5000 homonym–associate pairs. This database—publicly available at: www.blairarmstrong.net/homonymnorms/—constitutes a novel resource for computational cognitive modeling and computational linguistics, and we offer suggestions around good practices for its use in training and testing models on labeled data.","No"," semantic ambiguity homonyms meaning frequency homonym norming methods data movie subtitles free association homonym meaning annotations comparison homonym meaning frequency estimates derived movie television subtitles free association explicit ratings words ambiguous interpretation dependent context advancing theories ambiguity resolution important general theory language processing resolving inconsistencies observed ambiguity effects experimental tasks focusing homonyms words bank unrelated meanings edge river financial institution present work advances theories methods estimating relative frequency meanings factor shapes observed ambiguity effects develop method estimating meaning frequency based meaning homonym evoked lines movie television subtitles human raters replicate extend measure meaning frequency derived classification free associates evaluate internal consistency measures compare published estimates based explicit ratings meaning frequency compare set norms predicting performance lexical semantic decision mega studies measures high internal consistency show agreement unique variance explained integrating cognitive theories memory demands experimental methodologies derive frequency estimates collected manual classifications homonyms lines subtitles homonyms homonym associate pairs database publicly wwwblairarmstrongnethomonymnorms constitutes resource computational cognitive modeling computational linguistics offer suggestions good practices training testing models labeled data",0

We applied the proposed model to a dataset to compare its performance with traditional DCMs for polytomous items. We also conducted a simulation study based on the applied study condition in order to evaluate the parameter recovery of the proposed model. The findings suggest that the proposed model shows promise for (1) accommodating much smaller sample sizes by reducing a large number of parameters for estimation; (2) obtaining item category response probabilities and individual scores very similar to those from a traditional saturated model; and (3) providing general item information that is not available in traditional DCMs for polytomous items.","No"," diagnostic classification model rating scales psychological assessments polytomous item responses nominal response diagnostic model general diagnostic classification model rating scales study proposes evaluates general diagnostic classification model dcm rating scales applied proposed model dataset compare performance traditional dcms polytomous items conducted simulation study based applied study condition order evaluate parameter recovery proposed model findings suggest proposed model shows promise accommodating smaller sample sizes reducing large number parameters estimation obtaining item category response probabilities individual scores similar traditional saturated model providing general item information traditional dcms polytomous items",0
"4","KeywordsDecision-making Evidence accumulation models Random number generation Probability density approximation ","a method, framework, and tutorial for efficiently simulating models of decision-making","Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) have become the dominant models of rapid decision-making. Several variants of these models have been proposed, ranging from the simple linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) to the more complex leaky-competing accumulator (LCA), and further extensions that include time-varying rates of evidence accumulation or decision thresholds. Although applications of the simpler variants have been widespread, applications of the more complex models have been fewer, largely due to their intractable likelihood function and the computational cost of mass simulation. Here, I present a framework for efficiently fitting complex EAMs, which uses a new, efficient method of simulating these models. I find that the majority of simulation time is taken up by random number generation (RNG) from the normal distribution, needed for the stochastic noise of the differential equation. To reduce this inefficiency, I propose using the well-known concept within computer science of “look-up tables” (LUTs) as an approximation to the inverse cumulative density function (iCDF) method of RNG, which I call “LUT-iCDF”. I show that when using an appropriately sized LUT, simulations using LUT-iCDF closely match those from the standard RNG method in R. My framework, which I provide a detailed tutorial on how to implement, includes C code for 12 different variants of EAMs using the LUT-iCDF method, and should make the implementation of complex EAMs easier and faster.","No"," decision making evidence accumulation models random number generation probability density approximation method framework tutorial efficiently simulating models decision making evidence accumulation models eams dominant models rapid decision making variants models proposed ranging simple linear ballistic accumulator lba complex leaky competing accumulator lca extensions include time varying rates evidence accumulation decision thresholds applications simpler variants widespread applications complex models fewer largely due intractable likelihood function computational cost mass simulation present framework efficiently fitting complex eams efficient method simulating models find majority simulation time random number generation rng normal distribution needed stochastic noise differential equation reduce inefficiency propose concept computer science tables luts approximation inverse cumulative density function icdf method rng call lut icdf show appropriately sized lut simulations lut icdf closely match standard rng method framework provide detailed tutorial implement includes code variants eams lut icdf method make implementation complex eams easier faster",0
"5","KeywordsNavigation Route learning Navigation test Cognitive aging ","a novel virtual-reality-based route-learning test suite: assessing the effects of cognitive aging on navigation","Most research groups studying human navigational behavior with virtual environment (VE) technology develop their own tasks and protocols. This makes it difficult to compare results between groups and to create normative data sets for any specific navigational task. Such norms, however, are prerequisites for the use of navigation assessments as diagnostic tools—for example, to support the early and differential diagnosis of atypical aging. Here we start addressing these problems by presenting and evaluating a new navigation test suite that we make freely available to other researchers (https://osf.io/mx52y/). Specifically, we designed three navigational tasks, which are adaptations of earlier published tasks used to study the effects of typical and atypical aging on navigation: a route-repetition task that can be solved using egocentric navigation strategies, and route-retracing and directional-approach tasks that both require allocentric spatial processing. Despite introducing a number of changes to the original tasks to make them look more realistic and ecologically valid, and therefore easy to explain to people unfamiliar with a VE or who have cognitive impairments, we replicated the findings from the original studies. Specifically, we found general age-related declines in navigation performance and additional specific difficulties in tasks that required allocentric processes. These findings demonstrate that our new tasks have task demands similar to those of the original tasks, and are thus suited to be used more widely.","No"," navigation route learning navigation test cognitive aging virtual reality based route learning test suite assessing effects cognitive aging navigation research groups studying human navigational behavior virtual environment ve technology develop tasks protocols makes difficult compare results groups create normative data sets specific navigational task norms prerequisites navigation assessments diagnostic tools support early differential diagnosis atypical aging start addressing problems presenting evaluating navigation test suite make freely researchers httpsosfiomxy specifically designed navigational tasks adaptations earlier published tasks study effects typical atypical aging navigation route repetition task solved egocentric navigation strategies route retracing directional approach tasks require allocentric spatial processing introducing number original tasks make realistic ecologically valid easy explain people unfamiliar ve cognitive impairments replicated findings original studies specifically found general age related declines navigation performance additional specific difficulties tasks required allocentric processes findings demonstrate tasks task demands similar original tasks suited widely",0
"6","KeywordsEye tracking Nystagmus Calibration ","a robust method for calibration of eye tracking data recorded during nystagmus","Eye tracking is a useful tool when studying the oscillatory eye movements associated with nystagmus. However, this oscillatory nature of nystagmus is problematic during calibration since it introduces uncertainty about where the person is actually looking. This renders comparisons between separate recordings unreliable. Still, the influence of the calibration protocol on eye movement data from people with nystagmus has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we propose a calibration method using Procrustes analysis in combination with an outlier correction algorithm, which is based on a model of the calibration data and on the geometry of the experimental setup. The proposed method is compared to previously used calibration polynomials in terms of accuracy, calibration plane distortion and waveform robustness. Six recordings of calibration data, validation data and optokinetic nystagmus data from people with nystagmus and seven recordings from a control group were included in the study. Fixation errors during the recording of calibration data from the healthy participants were introduced, simulating fixation errors caused by the oscillatory movements found in nystagmus data. The outlier correction algorithm improved the accuracy for all tested calibration methods. The accuracy and calibration plane distortion performance of the Procrustes analysis calibration method were similar to the top performing mapping functions for the simulated fixation errors. The performance in terms of waveform robustness was superior for the Procrustes analysis calibration compared to the other calibration methods. The overall performance of the Procrustes calibration methods was best for the datasets containing errors during the calibration.","No"," eye tracking nystagmus calibration robust method calibration eye tracking data recorded nystagmus eye tracking tool studying oscillatory eye movements nystagmus oscillatory nature nystagmus problematic calibration introduces uncertainty person renders comparisons separate recordings unreliable influence calibration protocol eye movement data people nystagmus investigated work propose calibration method procrustes analysis combination outlier correction algorithm based model calibration data geometry experimental setup proposed method compared previously calibration polynomials terms accuracy calibration plane distortion waveform robustness recordings calibration data validation data optokinetic nystagmus data people nystagmus recordings control group included study fixation errors recording calibration data healthy participants introduced simulating fixation errors caused oscillatory movements found nystagmus data outlier correction algorithm improved accuracy tested calibration methods accuracy calibration plane distortion performance procrustes analysis calibration method similar top performing mapping functions simulated fixation errors performance terms waveform robustness superior procrustes analysis calibration compared calibration methods performance procrustes calibration methods datasets errors calibration",0

However, performing a qualitative analysis across a massive social media data set is cumbersome and impractical. Instead, researchers often extract a subset of content to analyze, but a framework to facilitate this process is currently lacking. We present a four-phased framework for improving this extraction process, which blends the capacities of data science techniques to compress large data sets into smaller spaces, with the capabilities of qualitative analysis to address research questions. We demonstrate this framework by investigating the topics of Australian Twitter commentary on climate change, using quantitative (non-negative matrix inter-joint factorization; topic alignment) and qualitative (thematic analysis) techniques. Our approach is useful for researchers seeking to perform qualitative analyses of social media, or researchers wanting to supplement their quantitative work with a qualitative analysis of broader social context and meaning.","No"," big data topic modeling thematic analysis twitter climate change joint matrix factorization topic alignment analyzing social media data mixed methods framework combining computational qualitative text analysis qualitative researchers social media offers opportunity harvest massive diverse range content intrusive intensive data collection procedures performing qualitative analysis massive social media data set cumbersome impractical researchers extract subset content analyze framework facilitate process lacking present phased framework improving extraction process blends capacities data science techniques compress large data sets smaller spaces capabilities qualitative analysis address research questions demonstrate framework investigating topics australian twitter commentary climate change quantitative negative matrix inter joint factorization topic alignment qualitative thematic analysis techniques approach researchers seeking perform qualitative analyses social media researchers wanting supplement quantitative work qualitative analysis broader social context meaning",0
"8","KeywordsAutobiographical memory Text mining Natural language processing ","autobiographical recall of personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails: an automatic analytic approach using e-mail communications","An important question that arises from autobiographical memory research is whether the variables that influence memory in the laboratory also drive memory for autobiographical episodes in real life. We explored this question within the context of e-mail communications and investigated the variables that influence recall for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails. We designed a Web-based program that analyzed each participant’s year-old sent e-mail archive and applied textual analysis algorithms to identify a set of sentences likely to be memorable. These sentences were then used as the stimuli in a cued recall task. Participants saw two sentences from their sent e-mail as a cue and attempted to recall the name of the e-mail recipient. Participants also rated the vividness of recall for the e-mail conversation and estimated the month in which they had written the e-mail. Linear mixed-effect analyses revealed that recipient name recall accuracy decreased with longer retention intervals and increased with greater frequency of contact with the recipient. Also, with longer retention intervals, participants dated e-mails as being more recent than their actual month. This telescoping error was moderately larger for e-mails with greater sentiment. These findings suggest that memory for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails closely follows the patterns for autobiographical memory and proper-name recall found in laboratory settings. This study introduces an innovative, Web-based experimental method for studying the cognitive processes related to autobiographical memories using ecologically valid, naturalistic communications.","No"," autobiographical memory text mining natural language processing autobiographical recall personally familiar names temporal information mails automatic analytic approach mail communications important question arises autobiographical memory research variables influence memory laboratory drive memory autobiographical episodes real life explored question context mail communications investigated variables influence recall personally familiar names temporal information mails designed web based program analyzed participant year mail archive applied textual analysis algorithms identify set sentences memorable sentences stimuli cued recall task participants sentences mail cue attempted recall mail recipient participants rated vividness recall mail conversation estimated month written mail linear mixed effect analyses revealed recipient recall accuracy decreased longer retention intervals increased greater frequency contact recipient longer retention intervals participants dated mails recent actual month telescoping error moderately larger mails greater sentiment findings suggest memory personally familiar names temporal information mails closely patterns autobiographical memory proper recall found laboratory settings study introduces innovative web based experimental method studying cognitive processes related autobiographical memories ecologically valid naturalistic communications",0
"9","KeywordsConceptual recurrence analysis Text analysis Semantic similarity Semantic coordination Team communication Interpersonal communication ","beyond frequency counts: novel conceptual recurrence analysis metrics to index semantic coordination in team communications","Semantic alignment is a key process underlying interpersonal and team communication. However, semantic similarity is difficult to quantify, and statistical approaches designed to measure it often rely on methods that make the identification of the relative importance of key words difficult. This study outlines how conceptual recurrence analysis (CRA) can address these issues and can be used to detect conceptual structure in interpersonal communication. We developed several novel CRA metrics to analyze communication data reported previously by Mancuso, Finomore, Rahill, Blair, and Funke (Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 58, 405–409, 2014), gathered from teams who worked cooperatively on a logic puzzle under different cognitive biasing contexts. CRA, like other measures of semantic coordination, relies on parameters whose values affect estimates of semantic alignment. We evaluated how the dimensionality of semantic spaces affects metrics quantifying the conceptual similarity of communicative exchanges, and whether metrics calculated from top-down, a priori semantic spaces or bottom-up semantic spaces empirically derived from each data set were more sensitive to biasing context. We found that the novel CRA measures were sensitive to manipulations of cognitive bias, and that higher-dimensional, bottom-up semantic spaces generally yielded more sensitivity to the experimental manipulations, though when the communication was evaluated with respect to specific key concepts, lower-dimensional, top-down spaces performed nearly as well. We conclude that CRA is sensitive to experimental manipulations in ways consistent with prior findings and that it presents a customizable framework for testing predictions about interpersonal communication patterns and other linguistic exchanges.","No"," conceptual recurrence analysis text analysis semantic similarity semantic coordination team communication interpersonal communication frequency counts conceptual recurrence analysis metrics index semantic coordination team communications semantic alignment key process underlying interpersonal team communication semantic similarity difficult quantify statistical approaches designed measure rely methods make identification relative importance key words difficult study outlines conceptual recurrence analysis cra address issues detect conceptual structure interpersonal communication developed cra metrics analyze communication data reported previously mancuso finomore rahill blair funke proceedings human factors ergonomics society annual meeting gathered teams worked cooperatively logic puzzle cognitive biasing contexts cra measures semantic coordination relies parameters values affect estimates semantic alignment evaluated dimensionality semantic spaces affects metrics quantifying conceptual similarity communicative exchanges metrics calculated top priori semantic spaces bottom semantic spaces empirically derived data set sensitive biasing context found cra measures sensitive manipulations cognitive bias higher dimensional bottom semantic spaces generally yielded sensitivity experimental manipulations communication evaluated respect specific key concepts lower dimensional top spaces performed conclude cra sensitive experimental manipulations ways consistent prior findings presents customizable framework testing predictions interpersonal communication patterns linguistic exchanges",0

Apart from collecting writing latencies, durations, and accuracy, we also compiled 14 lexical variables for each character. Regressions showed that frequency, age of acquisition, and the word context (in which a character appears) are all-around and influential predictors of orthographic access (as reflected in writing latency), motor execution of handwriting (as reflected in writing duration), and accuracy. In addition, phonological factors (phonogram status, spelling regularity, and homophone density) impacted orthographic access but not handwriting execution. Semantic factors (imageability and concreteness) only affected accuracy. These results suggest, among other things, that phonology is consulted in orthographic access while handwriting. As the first of its kind, this database can be used as a source of secondary data analyses and a tool for stimulus construction in handwriting research.","No"," handwriting chinese database lexicon phonology orthography chinese character handwriting large scale behavioral study database report psycholinguistic database chinese character handwriting based large scale study involved participants handwriting characters randomly sampled cohort characters collecting writing latencies durations accuracy compiled lexical variables character regressions showed frequency age acquisition word context character appears influential predictors orthographic access reflected writing latency motor execution handwriting reflected writing duration accuracy addition phonological factors phonogram status spelling regularity homophone density impacted orthographic access handwriting execution semantic factors imageability concreteness affected accuracy results suggest things phonology consulted orthographic access handwriting kind database source secondary data analyses tool stimulus construction handwriting research",0
"12","KeywordsMeta-analysis Standardized regression coefficients Effect size ","concealed correlations meta-analysis: a new method for synthesizing standardized regression coefficients","The synthesis of standardized regression coefficients is still a controversial issue in the field of meta-analysis. The difficulty lies in the fact that the standardized regression coefficients belonging to regression models that include different sets of covariates do not represent the same parameter, and thus their direct combination is meaningless. In the present study, a new approach called concealed correlations meta-analysis is proposed that allows for using the common information that standardized regression coefficients from different regression models contain to improve the precision of a combined focal standardized regression coefficient estimate. The performance of this new approach was compared with that of two other approaches: (1) carrying out separate meta-analyses for standardized regression coefficients from studies that used the same regression model, and (2) performing a meta-regression on the focal standardized regression coefficients while including an indicator variable as a moderator indicating the regression model to which each standardized regression coefficient belongs. The comparison was done through a simulation study. The results showed that, as expected, the proposed approach led to more accurate estimates of the combined standardized regression coefficients under both random- and fixed-effect models.","No"," meta analysis standardized regression coefficients effect size concealed correlations meta analysis method synthesizing standardized regression coefficients synthesis standardized regression coefficients controversial issue field meta analysis difficulty lies fact standardized regression coefficients belonging regression models include sets covariates represent parameter direct combination meaningless present study approach called concealed correlations meta analysis proposed common information standardized regression coefficients regression models improve precision combined focal standardized regression coefficient estimate performance approach compared approaches carrying separate meta analyses standardized regression coefficients studies regression model performing meta regression focal standardized regression coefficients including indicator variable moderator indicating regression model standardized regression coefficient belongs comparison simulation study results showed expected proposed approach led accurate estimates combined standardized regression coefficients random fixed effect models",0

Infants, children, and adults are capable of using statistical learning (SL) to extract information about their environment. Although most studies have looked at group-level performance, a growing literature examines individual differences in SL and their relation to language-learning outcomes: Individuals who are better at SL are expected to show better linguistic abilities. Accordingly, studies have shown positive correlations between SL performance and language outcomes in both children and adults. However, these studies have often used tasks designed to explore group-level performance without modifying them, resulting in psychometric shortcomings that impact reliability in adults (Siegelman, Bogaerts, Christiansen, & Frost in Transactions of the Royal Society B, 372, 20160059, 2017a; Siegelman, Bogaerts, & Frost in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 418–432, 2017b). Even though similar measures are used to assess individual differences in children, no study to date has examined the reliability of these measures in development. This study examined the reliability of common SL measures in both children and adults. It assessed the reliability of three SL tasks (two auditory and one visual) twice (two months apart) in adults and children (mean age 8 years). Although the tasks showed moderate reliability in adults, they did not capture stable individual variation in children. None of the tasks were reliable across sessions, and all showed internal consistency measures well below psychometric standards. These findings raise significant concerns about the use of current SL measures to predict and explain individual differences in development. The article ends with a discussion of possible explanations for the difference in reliability between children and adults.","No"," statistical learning individual differences reliability domain generality children current statistical learning tasks capture stable individual differences children investigation task reliability modality commonly statistical learning tasks capture stable individual differences children infants children adults capable statistical learning sl extract information environment studies looked group level performance growing literature examines individual differences sl relation language learning outcomes individuals sl expected show linguistic abilities studies shown positive correlations sl performance language outcomes children adults studies tasks designed explore group level performance modifying resulting psychometric shortcomings impact reliability adults siegelman bogaerts christiansen frost transactions royal society a siegelman bogaerts frost behavior research methods b similar measures assess individual differences children study date examined reliability measures development study examined reliability common sl measures children adults assessed reliability sl tasks auditory visual months adults children age years tasks showed moderate reliability adults capture stable individual variation children tasks reliable sessions showed internal consistency measures psychometric standards findings raise significant concerns current sl measures predict explain individual differences development article ends discussion explanations difference reliability children adults",0

We reviewed research comparing eye movements during self-categorized episodes of normal versus mindless reading and found little consensus regarding the specific measures that are sensitive to attentional decoupling during mind wandering. To address this issue of inconsistency, we conducted a new, high-powered eye-tracking experiment and considered all previously identified mind-wandering indicators. In our experiment, only three measures (reading time, fixation count, and first-fixation duration) positively predicted self-categorized mindless reading. Aside from these single measures, the word-frequency effect was found to be generally less pronounced during mindless-reading than during normal-reading episodes. To additionally test for convergent validity between the objective and subjective mind-wandering measures, we utilized eye-movement measures as well as thought reports, to examine the effect of metacognitive awareness on mind-wandering behavior. We expected that participants anticipating a difficult comprehension test would mind wander less during reading than would those anticipating an easy test. Although we were able to induce metacognitive expectancies about task difficulty, we found no evidence that these difficulty expectancies affected either subjectively reported or objectively measured mind wandering.","No"," mind wandering task unrelated thought eye movements reading eyes give validation study eye movement measures indicators mindless reading identifying eye movement measures objective indicators mind wandering work progress reviewed research comparing eye movements categorized episodes normal versus mindless reading found consensus specific measures sensitive attentional decoupling mind wandering address issue inconsistency conducted high powered eye tracking experiment considered previously identified mind wandering indicators experiment measures reading time fixation count fixation duration positively predicted categorized mindless reading single measures word frequency effect found generally pronounced mindless reading normal reading episodes additionally test convergent validity objective subjective mind wandering measures utilized eye movement measures thought reports examine effect metacognitive awareness mind wandering behavior expected participants anticipating difficult comprehension test mind wander reading anticipating easy test induce metacognitive expectancies task difficulty found evidence difficulty expectancies affected subjectively reported objectively measured mind wandering",0

"19","KeywordsPerceptual strength Norms Regression Psycholinguistic variables ","visual and auditory perceptual strength norms for 3,596 french nouns and their relationship with other psycholinguistic variables","Perceptual experience plays a critical role in the conceptual representation of words. Higher levels of semantic variables such as imageability, concreteness, and sensory experience are generally associated with faster and more accurate word processing. Nevertheless, these variables tend to be assessed mostly on the basis of visual experience. This underestimates the potential contributions of other perceptual modalities. Accordingly, recent evidence has stressed the importance of providing modality-specific perceptual strength norms. In the present study, we developed French Canadian norms of visual and auditory perceptual strength (i.e., the modalities that have major impact on word processing) for 3,596 nouns. We then explored the relationship between these newly developed variables and other lexical, orthographic, and semantic variables. Finally, we demonstrated the contributions of visual and auditory perceptual strength ratings to visual word processing beyond those of other semantic variables related to perceptual experience (e.g., concreteness, imageability, and sensory experience ratings).

Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding how characters should be segmented into logographemes and radicals. This article reports handwriting data for a list of 209 Chinese characters (95 nonphonetic compounds and 114 phonetic compounds) in a copying task. To validate the constituent logographemes and radicals of the target Chinese characters, comparisons among between-radical interstroke intervals (ISIs), between-logographeme ISIs, and within-logographeme ISIs, as well as their interactions with orthographic factors including character frequency, stroke number, and configuration, were conducted using factorial analyses. The results showed that the ISI comparison method is effective in validating the constituent logographemes and radicals in Chinese characters. On the basis of this list of 209 stimuli, another 1,227 Chinese characters that share the same set of radicals with the stimuli were further identified. Their constituent logographemes were deduced accordingly. Altogether, the over 1,000 Chinese characters with validated constituent logographemes will serve as a powerful reference for future psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research. Future potential applications are discussed.","No"," database chinese radicals logographemes validation constituent logographemes radicals chinese characters handwriting data studies shown logographemes radicals subcharacter units chinese characters represented orthographic lexicon functional processing units writing chinese characters consensus characters segmented logographemes radicals article reports handwriting data list chinese characters nonphonetic compounds phonetic compounds copying task validate constituent logographemes radicals target chinese characters comparisons radical interstroke intervals isis logographeme isis logographeme isis interactions orthographic factors including character frequency stroke number configuration conducted factorial analyses results showed isi comparison method effective validating constituent logographemes radicals chinese characters basis list stimuli chinese characters share set radicals stimuli identified constituent logographemes deduced altogether chinese characters validated constituent logographemes serve powerful reference future psycholinguistic neurolinguistic research future potential applications discussed",0

TAACO 2.0 includes all the original indices reported for TAACO 1.0, but it adds a number of new indices related to local and global cohesion at the semantic level, reported by latent semantic analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation, and word2vec. The tool also includes a source overlap feature, which calculates lexical and semantic overlap between a source and a response text (i.e., cohesion between the two texts based measures of text relatedness). In the first study in this article, we examined the effects that cohesion features, prompt, essay elaboration, and enhanced cohesion had on expert ratings of text coherence, finding that global semantic similarity as reported by word2vec was an important predictor of coherence ratings. A second study was conducted to examine the source and response indices. In this study we examined whether source overlap between the speaking samples found in the TOEFL-iBT integrated speaking tasks and the responses produced by test-takers was predictive of human ratings of speaking proficiency. The results indicated that the percentage of keywords found in both the source and response and the similarity between the source document and the response, as reported by word2vec, were significant predictors of speaking quality.

Motivated by a lack of suitable preexisting measures, we introduce in this article an adaptive and ecologically valid test of mistuning perception ability. The stimulus material consisted of short excerpts (6 to 12 s in length) from pop music performances (obtained from MedleyDB; Bittner et al., 2014) for which the vocal track was pitch-shifted relative to the instrumental tracks. In a first experiment, 333 listeners were tested on a two-alternative forced choice task that tested discrimination between a pitch-shifted and an unaltered version of the same audio clip. Explanatory item response modeling was then used to calibrate an adaptive version of the test. A subsequent validation experiment applied this adaptive test to 66 participants with a broad range of musical expertise, producing evidence of the test’s reliability, convergent validity, and divergent validity. The test is ready to be deployed as an experimental tool and should make an important contribution to our understanding of the human ability to judge mistuning.","No"," pitch perception musical abilities pitch accuracy gold msi mistuning perception test measurement instrument important aspect perceived quality vocal music degree vocalist sings tune listeners sensitive vocal mistuning development perceptual ability differs listeners motivated lack suitable preexisting measures introduce article adaptive ecologically valid test mistuning perception ability stimulus material consisted short excerpts length pop music performances obtained medleydb bittner al vocal track pitch shifted relative instrumental tracks experiment listeners tested alternative forced choice task tested discrimination pitch shifted unaltered version audio clip explanatory item response modeling calibrate adaptive version test subsequent validation experiment applied adaptive test participants broad range musical expertise producing evidence test reliability convergent validity divergent validity test ready deployed experimental tool make important contribution understanding human ability judge mistuning",0

This involves understanding changes in what words meant, how words were used, and how these changes may have responded to changes in the environment, such as in healthcare, wealth disparity, and war. Here we make available a tool, the Macroscope, for studying historical changes in language over the last two centuries. The Macroscope uses over 155 billion words of historical text, which will grow as we include new historical corpora, and derives word properties from frequency-of-usage and co-occurrence patterns over time. Using co-occurrence patterns, the Macroscope can track changes in semantics, allowing researchers to identify semantically stable and unstable words in historical text and providing quantitative information about changes in a word’s valence, arousal, and concreteness, as well as information about new properties, such as semantic drift. The Macroscope provides information about both the local and global properties of words, as well as information about how these properties change over time, allowing researchers to visualize and download data in order to make inferences about historical psychology. Although quantitative historical psychology represents a largely new field of study, we see this work as complementing a wealth of other historical investigations, offering new insights and new approaches to understanding existing theory.

"27","KeywordsPupillometry Executive functioning Arousal Cognitive load Psychophysics ","the human task-evoked pupillary response function is linear: implications for baseline response scaling in pupillometry","The human task-evoked pupillary response provides a sensitive physiological index of the intensity and online resource demands of numerous cognitive processes (e.g., memory retrieval, problem solving, or target detection). Cognitive pupillometry is a well-established technique that relies upon precise measurement of these subtle response functions. Baseline variability of pupil diameter is a complex artifact that typically necessitates mathematical correction. A methodological paradox within pupillometry is that linear and nonlinear forms of baseline scaling both remain accepted baseline correction techniques, despite yielding highly disparate results. The task-evoked pupillary response (TEPR) could potentially scale nonlinearly, similar to autonomic functions such as heart rate, in which the amplitude of an evoked response diminishes as the baseline rises. Alternatively, the TEPR could scale similarly to the cortical hemodynamic response, as a linear function that is independent of its baseline. However, the TEPR cannot scale both linearly and nonlinearly. Our aim was to adjudicate between linear and nonlinear scaling of human TEPR. We manipulated baseline pupil size by modulating the illuminance in the testing room as participants heard abrupt pure-tone transitions (Exp. 1) or visually monitored word lists (Exp. 2). Phasic pupillary responses scaled according to a linear function across all lighting (dark, mid, bright) and task (tones, words) conditions, demonstrating that the TEPR is independent of its baseline amplitude.

The Glasgow Norms are unique in several respects. First, the corpus itself is relatively large, while simultaneously providing norms across a substantial number of lexical dimensions. Second, for any given subset of words, the same participants provided ratings across all nine dimensions (33 participants/word, on average). Third, two novel dimensions—semantic size and gender association—are included. Finally, the corpus contains a set of 379 ambiguous words that are presented either alone (e.g., toast) or with information that selects an alternative sense (e.g., toast (bread), toast (speech)). The relationships between the dimensions of the Glasgow Norms were initially investigated by assessing their correlations. In addition, a principal component analysis revealed four main factors, accounting for 82% of the variance (Visualization, Emotion, Salience, and Exposure). The validity of the Glasgow Norms was established via comparisons of our ratings to 18 different sets of current psycholinguistic norms. The dimension of size was tested with megastudy data, confirming findings from past studies that have explicitly examined this variable. Alternative senses of ambiguous words (i.e., disambiguated forms), when discordant on a given dimension, seemingly led to appropriately distinct ratings. Informal comparisons between the ratings of ambiguous words and of their alternative senses showed different patterns that likely depended on several factors (the number of senses, their relative strengths, and the rating scales themselves). Overall, the Glasgow Norms provide a valuable resource—in particular, for researchers investigating the role of word recognition in language comprehension.","No"," psycholinguistic norms arousal valence dominance concreteness imageability familiarity age acquisition semantic size gender association glasgow norms ratings words scales glasgow norms set normative ratings english words psycholinguistic dimensions arousal valence dominance concreteness imageability familiarity age acquisition semantic size gender association glasgow norms unique respects corpus large simultaneously providing norms substantial number lexical dimensions subset words participants provided ratings dimensions participantsword average dimensions semantic size gender association included finally corpus set ambiguous words presented toast information selects alternative sense toast bread toast speech relationships dimensions glasgow norms initially investigated assessing correlations addition principal component analysis revealed main factors accounting variance visualization emotion salience exposure validity glasgow norms established comparisons ratings sets current psycholinguistic norms dimension size tested megastudy data confirming findings past studies explicitly examined variable alternative senses ambiguous words disambiguated forms discordant dimension seemingly led appropriately distinct ratings informal comparisons ratings ambiguous words alternative senses showed patterns depended factors number senses relative strengths rating scales glasgow norms provide valuable resource researchers investigating role word recognition language comprehension",0

The approach offers a way to capture motion adapted from the film industry in which markers placed on the skin of the face can be tracked with a pattern-matching algorithm. The method records and postprocesses raw facial movement data (coordinates per frame) of distinctly placed markers and is intended for use in facial expression research (e.g., microexpressions) in laboratory settings. Due to the explicit use of specifically placed, artificial markers, the procedure offers the simultaneous measurement of several emotionally relevant markers in a (psychometrically) objective and artifact-free way, even for facial regions without natural landmarks (e.g., the cheeks). In addition, the proposed procedure is fully based on open-source software and is transparent at every step of data processing. Two worked examples demonstrate the practicability of the proposed procedure: In Study 1(N= 39), the participants were instructed to show the emotions happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger, and in Study 2 (N= 113), they were asked to present both a neutral face and the emotions happiness, disgust, and fear. Study 2 involved the simultaneous tracking of 14 markers for approximately 12 min per participant with a time resolution of 33 ms. The measured facial movements corresponded closely to the assumptions of established measurement instruments (EMFACS, FACSAID, Friesen & Ekman, 1983; Ekman & Hager, 2002).

Although the lab provides excellent facilities for controlled testing, some questions are best explored by collecting information that is difficult to obtain in the lab. The vast amounts of data now available to researchers can be a valuable resource in this respect. By incorporating this new realm of data and translating it into traditional laboratory methods, we can expand the reach of the lab into the wilderness of human society. This study demonstrates how the troves of linguistic data generated by humans can be used to test theories about cognition and representation. It also suggests how similar interpretations can be made of other research in cognition. The first case tests a long-standing prediction of Gentner’s natural partition hypothesis: that verb meaning is more subject to change due to the textual context in which it appears than is the meaning of nouns. Within a diachronic corpus, verbs and other relational words indeed showed more evidence of semantic change than did concrete nouns. In the second case, corpus statistics were employed to empirically support the existence of phonesthemes—nonmorphemic units of sound that are associated with aspects of meaning. A third study also supported this measure, by demonstrating that it corresponds with performance in a lab experiment.

However, there has been a lack of normed studies describing generalizable principles in gesture production and in comprehension of the mappings of different types of iconic strategies (i.e., modes of representation; Müller, 2013). In Study 1 we elicited silent gestures in order to explore the implementation of different types of iconic representation (i.e., acting, representing, drawing, and personification) to express concepts across five semantic domains. In Study 2 we investigated the degree of meaning transparency (i.e., iconicity ratings) of the gestures elicited in Study 1. We found systematicity in the gestural forms of 109 concepts across all participants, with different types of iconicity aligning with specific semantic domains: Acting was favored for actions and manipulable objects, drawing for nonmanipulable objects, and personification for animate entities. Interpretation of gesture–meaning transparency was modulated by the interaction between mode of representation and semantic domain, with some couplings being more transparent than others: Acting yielded higher ratings for actions, representing for object-related concepts, personification for animate entities, and drawing for nonmanipulable entities. This study provides mapping principles that may extend to all forms of manual communication (gesture and sign).

The algorithmic method implemented in the spreadr subroutines follows the approach described in Vitevitch, Ercal, and Adagarla (Frontiers in Psychology, 2, 369, 2011), who viewed activation as a fixed cognitive resource that could “spread” among connected nodes in a network. Three sets of simulations were conducted using the package. The first set of simulations successfully reproduced the results reported in Vitevitch et al. (Frontiers in Psychology, 2, 369, 2011), who showed that a simple mechanism of spreading activation could account for the clustering coefficient effect in spoken word recognition. The second set of simulations showed that the same mechanism could be extended to account for higher false alarm rates for low clustering coefficient words in a false memory task. The final set of simulations demonstrated how spreading activation could be applied to a semantic network to account for semantic priming effects.

A rate-limiting factor in answering such questions is the challenge of recruiting rare DP participants. Although self-reported experiences have long played a role in efforts to identify DPs, much remains unknown about how such self-reports can or should contribute to screening or diagnosis. Here, in a large, population-based web sample, we investigated the effectiveness of self-report, used on its own, as a screen to identify individuals who will ultimately fail, at a conventional cutoff, the two types of objective tests that are most commonly used to confirm DP diagnoses: the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) and the famous faces memory test (FFMT). We used a highly reliable questionnaire (alpha = .91), the Cambridge Face Memory Questionnaire (CFMQ), and revealed strong validity via high correlations of .44 with the CFMT and .52 with the FFMT. However, cutoff analyses revealed that no CFMQ score yielded a clinical-grade combination of sensitivity and positive predictive value in enough individuals to support using it alone as a DP diagnostic or screening tool. This result was replicated in an analysis of data from the widely used PI20 questionnaire, a 20-question self-assessment of facial recognition similar in form to the CFMQ. We therefore recommend that screens for DP should, wherever possible, include objective as well as subjective assessment tools.","No"," report ability individual differences face recognition screening prosopagnosia meta cognition reported face recognition highly valid highly discriminative prosopagnosia level performance objective assessments severe developmental deficits face recognition ability developmental prosopagnosia dp vigorously studied past decade questions remain unanswered origins nature social consequences rate limiting factor answering questions challenge recruiting rare dp participants reported experiences long played role efforts identify dps remains unknown reports contribute screening diagnosis large population based web sample investigated effectiveness report screen identify individuals ultimately fail conventional cutoff types objective tests commonly confirm dp diagnoses cambridge face memory test cfmt famous faces memory test ffmt highly reliable questionnaire alpha cambridge face memory questionnaire cfmq revealed strong validity high correlations cfmt ffmt cutoff analyses revealed cfmq score yielded clinical grade combination sensitivity positive predictive individuals support dp diagnostic screening tool result replicated analysis data widely pi questionnaire question assessment facial recognition similar form cfmq recommend screens dp include objective subjective assessment tools",0

The method is based on moving the request for honest responding, often included in the introduction to surveys, to the questioning phase of the survey. Over a quarter of Internet survey participants do not read survey instructions, and therefore, instead of asking respondents to answer honestly, they were asked whether they responded honestly. Posing the honesty message in the form of questions on honest responding draws attention to the message, increases the processing of it, and puts subsequent questions in context with the questions on honest responding. In three studies (nStudy I = 475, nStudy II = 1,015, nStudy III = 899), we tested whether presenting the questions on honest responding before questions on desirable and undesirable behavior could increase the honesty of responses, under the assumption that less attribution of desirable behavior and/or admitting to more undesirable behavior could be taken to indicate more honest responses. In all studies the participants who were presented with the questions on honest responding before questions on the target behavior produced, on average, significantly less socially desirable responses, though the effect sizes were small in all cases (Cohen’s d ranging between 0.02 and 0.28 for single items, and from 0.17 to 0.34 for sum scores).

It is unclear, however, how to statistically quantify the amount of signal present in CIs, which limits the interpretability of these images. In this article, we propose a novel metric, infoVal, which assesses informational value relative to a resampled random distribution and can be interpreted like a z score. In the first part, we define the infoVal metric and show, through simulations, that it adheres to typical Type I error rates under various task conditions (internal validity). In the second part, we show that the metric correlates with markers of data quality in empirical reverse-correlation data, such as the subjective recognizability, objective discriminability, and test–retest reliability of the CIs (convergent validity). In the final part, we demonstrate how the infoVal metric can be used to compare the informational value of reverse-correlation datasets, by comparing data acquired online with data acquired in a controlled lab environment. We recommend a new standard of good practice in which researchers assess the infoVal scores of reverse-correlation data in order to ensure that they do not read signal in CIs where no signal is present. The infoVal metric is implemented in the open-source rcicr R package, to facilitate its adoption.","No"," reverse correlation data quality reliability online experiments social psychology quantifying informational classification images reverse correlation influential psychophysical paradigm participant responses randomly varying images build classification image ci commonly interpreted visualization participant mental representation unclear statistically quantify amount signal present cis limits interpretability images article propose metric infoval assesses informational relative resampled random distribution interpreted score part define infoval metric show simulations adheres typical type error rates task conditions internal validity part show metric correlates markers data quality empirical reverse correlation data subjective recognizability objective discriminability test retest reliability cis convergent validity final part demonstrate infoval metric compare informational reverse correlation datasets comparing data acquired online data acquired controlled lab environment recommend standard good practice researchers assess infoval scores reverse correlation data order ensure read signal cis signal present infoval metric implemented open source rcicr package facilitate adoption",0

Researchers have studied the effects of BOI in order to investigate the relationships between sensorimotor and cognitive processes. Such efforts could be improved, however, by the availability of more extensive BOI norms. In the present work, we collected BOI ratings for over 9,000 words. These new norms show good reliability and validity and have extensive overlap with the words used both in other lexical and semantic norms and in the available behavioral megastudies (e.g., the English Lexicon Project, Balota, Yap, Cortese, Hutchison, Kessler, & Loftis in Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007; and the Calgary Semantic Decision Project, Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017). In analyses using the new BOI norms, we found that high-BOI words tended to be more concrete, more graspable, and more strongly associated with sensory, haptic, and visual experience than are low-BOI words. When we used the new norms to predict response latencies and accuracy data from the behavioral megastudies, we found that BOI was a stronger predictor of responses in the semantic decision task than in the lexical decision task. These findings are consistent with a dynamic, multidimensional account of lexical semantics. The norms described here should be useful for future research examining the effects of sensorimotor experience on performance in tasks involving word stimuli.","No"," body object interaction lexical decision task semantic decision task sensorimotor processes word ratings word recognition quantifying sensorimotor experience body object interaction ratings english words ratings body object interaction boi measure ease human body interact word referent researchers studied effects boi order investigate relationships sensorimotor cognitive processes efforts improved availability extensive boi norms present work collected boi ratings words norms show good reliability validity extensive overlap words lexical semantic norms behavioral megastudies english lexicon project balota yap cortese hutchison kessler loftis behavior research methods calgary semantic decision project pexman heard lloyd yap behavior research methods analyses boi norms found high boi words tended concrete graspable strongly sensory haptic visual experience low boi words norms predict response latencies accuracy data behavioral megastudies found boi stronger predictor responses semantic decision task lexical decision task findings consistent dynamic multidimensional account lexical semantics norms future research examining effects sensorimotor experience performance tasks involving word stimuli",0

As expected, words drawn from the clinical subreddits could be used to distinguish several kinds of mental illness (ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression). Interestingly, words drawn from the nonclinical subreddits (e.g., travel, cooking, cars) could also be used to distinguish different categories of mental illness, implying that the impact of mental illness spills over into topics unrelated to mental illness. Most importantly, words derived from the nonclinical subreddits predicted future postings to clinical subreddits, implying that everyday language contains signal about the likelihood of future mental illness, possibly before people are aware of their mental health condition. Finally, whereas models trained on clinical subreddits learned to focus on words indicating disorder-specific symptoms, models trained to predict future mental illness learned to focus on words indicating life stress, suggesting that kinds of features that are predictive of mental illness may change over time.

In many of these studies, participants are typically told to learn foreign language–English translations, such as Swahili–English or Lithuanian–English pairs. One limitation of these currently available foreign language–English translation norms is that their foreign languages are based on the alphabetic writing system, thereby preventing researchers from generalizing their findings to languages based on logographic writing systems. In the present study we collected normative data for 160 Chinese–English word pairs. Participants completed three study–test cycles, followed by metacognitive judgments on their learning experience. For each pair, we report recall performance, recall latency, ease of learning, and judgments of learning. A simultaneous multiple regression analysis with frequency (of both the English word and the Chinese character), word length (English), and number of strokes (Chinese) as predictors revealed that a greater number of strokes (or higher visual complexity) for the Chinese characters predicted lower target recall.","No"," paired associates chinese english translations cued recall episodic memory normative data chinese english paired associates paired associate learning commonly paradigms study human memory studies participants typically told learn foreign language english translations swahili english lithuanian english pairs limitation foreign language english translation norms foreign languages based alphabetic writing system preventing researchers generalizing findings languages based logographic writing systems present study collected normative data chinese english word pairs participants completed study test cycles metacognitive judgments learning experience pair report recall performance recall latency ease learning judgments learning simultaneous multiple regression analysis frequency english word chinese character word length english number strokes chinese predictors revealed greater number strokes higher visual complexity chinese characters predicted lower target recall",0

As listeners, we make use of background knowledge — about the speaker, about entities and concepts, about previous utterances — in order to infer the speaker’s intended meaning. But even if there is consensus that these sources of information are a necessary component of linguistic communication, it is another matter entirely to provide a thorough, quantitative accounting for context’s interaction with language. When does context matter? What kinds of context matter in which kinds of domains? The empirical investigation of these questions is inhibited by a number of factors: the challenge of quantifying language, the boundless combinations of domains and types of context to be measured, and the challenge of selecting and applying a given construct to natural language data. In response to these factors, we introduce and demonstrate a methodological framework for testing the importance of contextual information in inferring speaker intentions from text. We apply Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks, a standard for representing language in its natural, sequential state, and conduct a set of experiments for predicting the persuasive intentions of speakers in political debates using different combinations of text and background information about the speaker.

"44",NA,"introduction to special issue. beyond the lab: using big data to discover principles of cognition","Like many other scientific disciplines, psychological science has felt the impact of the big-data revolution. This impact arises from the meeting of three forces: data availability, data heterogeneity, and data analyzability. In terms of data availability, consider that for decades, researchers relied on the Brown Corpus of about one million words (Kučera & Francis, 1969). Modern resources, in contrast, are larger by six orders of magnitude (e.g., Google’s 1T corpus) and are available in a growing number of languages. About 240 billion photos have been uploaded to Facebook,1 and Instagram receives over 100 million new photos each day.2 The large-scale digitization of these data has made it possible in principle to analyze and aggregate these resources on a previously unimagined scale. Heterogeneity refers to the availability of different types of data. For example, recent progress in automatic image recognition is owed not just to improvements in algorithms and hardware, but arguably more to the ability to merge large collections of images with linguistic labels (produced by crowdsourced human taggers) that serve as training data to the algorithms. Making use of heterogeneous data sources often depends on their standardization. For example, the ability to combine demographic and grammatical data about thousands of languages led to the finding that languages spoken by more people have simpler morphologies (Lupyan & Dale, 2010). The ability to combine these data types would have been substantially more difficult without the existence of standardized language and country codes that could be used to merge the different data sources. Finally, analyzability must be ensured, for without appropriate tools to process and analyze different types of data, the “data” are merely bytes.","No"," introduction special issue lab big data discover principles cognition scientific disciplines psychological science felt impact big data revolution impact arises meeting forces data availability data heterogeneity data analyzability terms data availability decades researchers relied brown corpus million words ku era francis modern resources contrast larger orders magnitude google t corpus growing number languages billion photos uploaded facebook instagram receives million photos day large scale digitization data made principle analyze aggregate resources previously unimagined scale heterogeneity refers availability types data recent progress automatic image recognition owed improvements algorithms hardware arguably ability merge large collections images linguistic labels produced crowdsourced human taggers serve training data algorithms making heterogeneous data sources depends standardization ability combine demographic grammatical data thousands languages led finding languages spoken people simpler morphologies lupyan dale ability combine data types substantially difficult existence standardized language country codes merge data sources finally analyzability ensured tools process analyze types data data bytes",0

The uncertainty due to sampling variability in the norming phase is ignored. To express uncertainty due to norming, we propose a flexible method that is applicable in continuous norming and allows for a variety of score distributions, using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS; Rigby & Stasinopoulos, 2005). We assessed the performance of this method in a simulation study, by examining the quality of the resulting CIs. We varied the population model, procedure of estimating the CI, confidence level, sample size, value of the predictor, extremity of the test score, and type of variance-covariance matrix. The results showed that good quality of the CIs could be achieved in most conditions. The method is illustrated using normative data of the SON-R 6-40 test. We recommend test developers to use this approach to arrive at CIs, and thus properly express the uncertainty due to norm sampling fluctuations, in the context of continuous norming. Adopting this approach will help (e.g., clinical) practitioners to obtain a fair picture of the person assessed.","No"," continuous norming gamlss box cox power exponential distribution posterior simulation psychological tests improving confidence intervals normed test scores include uncertainty due sampling variability test publishers provide confidence intervals cis normed test scores reflect uncertainty due unreliability tests uncertainty due sampling variability norming phase express uncertainty due norming propose flexible method applicable continuous norming variety score distributions generalized additive models location scale shape gamlss rigby stasinopoulos assessed performance method simulation study examining quality resulting cis varied population model procedure estimating ci confidence level sample size predictor extremity test score type variance covariance matrix results showed good quality cis achieved conditions method illustrated normative data son test recommend test developers approach arrive cis properly express uncertainty due norm sampling fluctuations context continuous norming adopting approach clinical practitioners obtain fair picture person assessed",0

In this framework, networks capture within-concept statistics that reflect how properties relate to one another across instances of a concept. We extracted formal measures of these networks that capture different aspects of network structure, and explored whether a concept’s network structure relates to its flexibility of use. To do so, we compared network measures to a text-based measure of semantic diversity, as well as to empirical data from a figurative-language task and an alternative-uses task. We found that network-based measures were predictive of the text-based and empirical measures of flexible concept use, highlighting the ability of this approach to formally capture relevant characteristics of conceptual structure. Conceptual flexibility is a fundamental attribute of the cognitive and semantic systems, and in this proof of concept we reveal that variations in concept representation and use can be formally understood in terms of the informational content and topology of concept networks.","No"," conceptual knowledge conceptual flexibility network science implementing concept network model concept things instantiated forms depending context suggesting degree flexibility conceptual system propose feature based network model capture predict flexibility modeled individual concepts banana bottle graph theoretical networks properties yellow sweet represented nodes associations edges framework networks capture concept statistics reflect properties relate instances concept extracted formal measures networks capture aspects network structure explored concept network structure relates flexibility compared network measures text based measure semantic diversity empirical data figurative language task alternative task found network based measures predictive text based empirical measures flexible concept highlighting ability approach formally capture relevant characteristics conceptual structure conceptual flexibility fundamental attribute cognitive semantic systems proof concept reveal variations concept representation formally understood terms informational content topology concept networks",0

During group interactions, members take on different roles within the discussion. Roles have distinct patterns of behavioral engagement (i.e., active or passive, leading or following), contribution characteristics (i.e., providing new information or echoing given material), and social orientation (i.e., individual or group). Different combinations of roles can produce characteristically different group outcomes, and thus can be either less or more productive with regard to collective goals. In online collaborative-learning environments, this can lead to better or worse learning outcomes for the individual participants. In this study, we propose and validate a novel approach for detecting emergent roles from participants’ contributions and patterns of interaction. Specifically, we developed a group communication analysis (GCA) by combining automated computational linguistic techniques with analyses of the sequential interactions of online group communication. GCA was applied to three large collaborative interaction datasets (participant N = 2,429, group N = 3,598). Cluster analyses and linear mixed-effects modeling were used to assess the validity of the GCA approach and the influence of learner roles on student and group performance. The results indicated that participants’ patterns of linguistic coordination and cohesion are representative of the roles that individuals play in collaborative discussions. More broadly, GCA provides a framework for researchers to explore the micro intra- and interpersonal patterns associated with participants’ roles and the sociocognitive processes related to successful collaboration.","No"," group communication analysis social roles group interaction computational linguistics group communication analysis computational linguistics approach detecting sociocognitive roles multiparty interactions roles important concepts understanding human sociocognitive behavior group interactions members roles discussion roles distinct patterns behavioral engagement active passive leading contribution characteristics providing information echoing material social orientation individual group combinations roles produce characteristically group outcomes productive regard collective goals online collaborative learning environments lead worse learning outcomes individual participants study propose validate approach detecting emergent roles participants contributions patterns interaction specifically developed group communication analysis gca combining automated computational linguistic techniques analyses sequential interactions online group communication gca applied large collaborative interaction datasets participant group cluster analyses linear mixed effects modeling assess validity gca approach influence learner roles student group performance results participants patterns linguistic coordination cohesion representative roles individuals play collaborative discussions broadly gca framework researchers explore micro intra interpersonal patterns participants roles sociocognitive processes related successful collaboration",0

Processing tends to be facilitated for words with high as compared with low BOI, across a wide variety of tasks. Such effects have been referenced in debates over the nature of semantic representations, but their theoretical import has been limited by the fact that BOI is a fairly coarse measure of sensorimotor experience with words’ referents. In the present study, we collected ratings for 621 words on seven semantic dimensions (graspability, ease of pantomime, number of actions, animacy, size, danger, and usefulness), in order to investigate which attributes are most strongly related to BOI ratings and to lexical–semantic processing. BOI ratings were obtained from previous norming studies (Bennett, Burnett, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 43, 1100–1109, 2011; Tillotson, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 40, 1075–1078, 2008), and measures of lexical–semantic processing were obtained from previous behavioral megastudies involving either the semantic categorization task (concrete/abstract decision; Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017) or the lexical decision task (Balota et al., Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007). The results showed that the motor dimensions of graspability, ease of pantomime, and number of actions were all related to BOI, and that these dimensions together explained more variance in semantic processing than did the BOI ratings alone.

Moreover, this thresholding is largely left for the end user. Here we present and develop gazeNet, a new framework for creating event detectors that do not require hand-crafted signal features or signal thresholding. It employs an end-to-end deep learning approach, which takes raw eye-tracking data as input and classifies it into fixations, saccades and post-saccadic oscillations. Our method thereby challenges an established tacit assumption that hand-crafted features are necessary in the design of event detection algorithms. The downside of the deep learning approach is that a large amount of training data is required. We therefore first develop a method to augment hand-coded data, so that we can strongly enlarge the data set used for training, minimizing the time spent on manual coding. Using this extended hand-coded data, we train a neural network that produces eye-movement event classification from raw eye-movement data without requiring any predefined feature extraction or post-processing steps. The resulting classification performance is at the level of expert human coders.

Based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, every single word is related to a set of topics with different weight. The weights are further estimated in order to determine the semantic relation between the words and the rest of the documents. Apparently the chief drawback of topic modeling techniques, specifically LDA, lies on their incapability in clustering short texts in which semantic relation between words is neglected.

Their diachronic invariance or survival over time in one language and their ability to discriminate against other languages will be analized. In order to do so, we will examine a total of 101 languages of which 261 texts have been taken. All of them are very diverse in style and time, taking us through a wide linguistic and temporal spectrum that will cover the period from the 6th century BC to the present day.
