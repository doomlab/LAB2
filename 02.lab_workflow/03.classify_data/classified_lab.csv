The Flickr frequency norms: What 17 years of images tagged online tell us about lexical processing,2022,10.3758/s13428-022-02031-y,Behavior Research Methods,Marco A.

Mandarin Chinese modality exclusivity norms,2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0211336,PLoS ONE,I-Hsuan Chen; Qingqing Zhao; Yunfei Long; Lu Qin; Chu‐Ren Huang,"Modality exclusivity norms have been developed in different languages for research on the relationship between perceptual and conceptual systems. This paper sets up the first modality exclusivity norms for Chinese, a Sino-Tibetan language with semantics as its orthographically relevant level. The norms are collected through two studies based on Chinese sensory words. The experimental designs take into consideration the morpho-lexical and orthographic structures of Chinese. Study 1 provides a set of norms for Mandarin Chinese single-morpheme words in mean ratings of the extent to which a word is experienced through the five sense modalities. The degrees of modality exclusivity are also provided. The collected norms are further analyzed to examine how sub-lexical orthographic representations of sense modalities in Chinese characters affect speakers' interpretation of the sensory words. In particular, we found higher modality exclusivity rating for the sense modality explicitly represented by a semantic radical component, as well as higher auditory dominant modality rating for characters with transparent phonetic symbol components. Study 2 presents the mean ratings and modality exclusivity of coordinate disyllabic compounds involving multiple sense modalities. These studies open new perspectives in the study of modality exclusivity. First, links between modality exclusivity and writing systems have been established which has strengthened previous accounts of the influence of orthography in the processing of visual information in reading. Second, a new set of modality exclusivity norms of compounds is proposed to show the competition of influence on modality exclusivity from different linguistic factors and potentially allow such norms to be linked to studies on synesthesia and semantic transparency.","['Modality (human–computer interaction)', 'Mandarin Chinese', 'Computer science', 'Computational biology', 'Biology', 'Linguistics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W2915194119,True,60,10.1371/journal.pone.0211336,modality humancomputer interaction mandarin chinese computer science computational biology biology linguistics artificial intelligence philosophy mandarin chinese modality exclusivity norms modality exclusivity norms developed different languages research relationship perceptual conceptual systems paper sets modality exclusivity norms chinese sino tibetan language semantics orthographically relevant level norms collected studies based chinese sensory words experimental designs consideration morpho lexical orthographic structures chinese study provides set norms mandarin chinese single morpheme words mean ratings extent word experienced sense modalities degrees modality exclusivity provided collected norms analyzed examine sub lexical orthographic representations sense modalities chinese characters affect speakers interpretation sensory words particular higher modality exclusivity rating sense modality explicitly represented semantic radical component higher auditory dominant modality rating characters transparent phonetic symbol components study presents mean ratings modality exclusivity coordinate disyllabic compounds involving multiple sense modalities studies open new perspectives study modality exclusivity links modality exclusivity writing systems established strengthened previous accounts influence orthography processing visual information reading second new set modality exclusivity norms compounds proposed competition influence modality exclusivity different linguistic factors potentially allow norms linked studies synesthesia semantic transparency,1

Quantifying social semantics: An inclusive definition of socialness and ratings for 8388 English words,2022,10.3758/s13428-022-01810-x,Behavior Research Methods,Veronica Diveica; Penny M. Pexman; Richard J. Binney,"It has been proposed that social experience plays an important role in the grounding of concepts, and socialness has been proffered as a fundamental organisational principle underpinning semantic representation in the human brain. However, the empirical support for these hypotheses is limited by inconsistencies in the way socialness has been defined and measured. To further advance theory, the field must establish a clearer working definition, and research efforts could be facilitated by the availability of an extensive set of socialness ratings for individual concepts. Therefore, in the current work, we employed a novel and inclusive definition to test the extent to which socialness is reliably perceived as a broad construct, and we report socialness norms for over 8000 English words, including nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Our inclusive socialness measure shows good reliability and validity, and our analyses suggest that the socialness ratings capture aspects of word meaning which are distinct to those measured by other pertinent semantic constructs, including concreteness and emotional valence. Finally, in a series of regression analyses, we show for the first time that the socialness of a word's meaning explains unique variance in participant performance on lexical tasks. Our dataset of socialness norms has considerable item overlap with those used in both other lexical/semantic norms and in available behavioural mega-studies. They can help target testable predictions about brain and behaviour derived from multiple representation theories and neurobiological accounts of social semantics.","['Concreteness', 'Noun', 'Psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Semantics (computer science)', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Psychotherapist', 'Programming language']",https://openalex.org/W4221022654,True,55,10.3758/s13428-022-01810-x,concreteness noun psychology cognitive psychology semantics computer science meaning existential computer science natural language processing linguistics philosophy psychotherapist programming language quantifying social semantics inclusive definition socialness ratings english words proposed social experience plays important role grounding concepts socialness proffered fundamental organisational principle underpinning semantic representation human brain empirical support hypotheses limited inconsistencies way socialness defined measured advance theory field establish clearer working definition research efforts facilitated availability extensive set socialness ratings individual concepts current work employed novel inclusive definition test extent socialness reliably perceived broad construct report socialness norms english words including nouns verbs adjectives inclusive socialness measure shows good reliability validity analyses suggest socialness ratings capture aspects word meaning distinct measured pertinent semantic constructs including concreteness emotional valence finally series regression analyses time socialness word meaning explains unique variance participant performance lexical tasks dataset socialness norms considerable item overlap used lexical semantic norms available behavioural mega studies help target testable predictions brain behaviour derived multiple representation theories neurobiological accounts social semantics,1
Italian Age of Acquisition Norms for a Large Set of Words (ItAoA),2019,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00278,Frontiers in Psychology,Maria Montefinese; David Vinson; Gabriella Vigliocco; Ettore Ambrosini,"Age of acquisition (AoA) is an important psycholinguistic variable that affects the performance of healthy individuals and patients in a large variety of cognitive tasks. For this reason, it becomes more and more compelling to collect new AoA norms for a large set of stimuli in order to allow better control and manipulation of AoA in future research. An important motivation of the present study is to extend previous Italian norms by collecting AoA ratings for a much larger range of Italian words for which concreteness and semantic-affective norms are now available thus ensuring greater coverage of words varying along these dimensions. In the present study, we collected AoA ratings for 1,957 Italian content words (adjectives, nouns and verbs), by asking healthy adult participants to estimate the age at which they thought they had learnt the word in a Web survey procedure. First, we found high split-half correlation within our sample, suggesting strong internal reliability. Second, our data indicate that the ratings collected in this study are as valid and reliable as those collected in previous studies for Italian across different age populations (adult and children) and other languages. Finally, we analyzed the relation between AoA ratings and other lexical-semantic variables (e.g. word frequency, imageability, valence, arousal) and showed that these correlations were generally consistent with the correlations reported in other normative studies for Italian and other languages. Therefore, our new AoA norms are a valuable source of information for future research in the Italian language.

The Children’s Picture Books Lexicon (CPB-Lex): A large-scale lexical database from children’s picture books,2023,10.3758/s13428-023-02198-y,Behavior Research Methods,Clarence Green; Kathleen Keogh; He Sun; Beth A. O’Brien,"This article presents CPB-LEX, a large-scale database of lexical statistics derived from children's picture books (age range 0-8 years). Such a database is essential for research in psychology, education and computational modelling, where rich details on the vocabulary of early print exposure are required. CPB-LEX was built through an innovative method of computationally extracting lexical information from automatic speech-to-text captions and subtitle tracks generated from social media channels dedicated to reading picture books aloud. It consists of approximately 25,585 types (wordforms) and their frequency norms (raw and Zipf-transformed), a lexicon of bigrams (two-word sequences and their transitional probabilities) and a document-term matrix (which shows the importance of each word in the corpus in each book). Several immediate contributions of CPB-LEX to behavioural science research are reported, including that the new CPB-LEX frequency norms strongly predict age of acquisition and outperform comparable child-input lexical databases. The database allows researchers and practitioners to extract lexical statistics for high-frequency words which can be used to develop word lists. The paper concludes with an investigation of how CPB-LEX can be used to extend recent modelling research on the lexical diversity children receive from picture books in addition to child-directed speech. Our model shows that the vocabulary input from a relatively small number of picture books can dramatically enrich vocabulary exposure from child-directed speech and potentially assist children with vocabulary input deficits.

Stealing Cookies in the Twenty-First Century: Measures of Spoken Narrative in Healthy Versus Speakers With Aphasia,2018,10.1044/2018_ajslp-17-0131,American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology,Shauna Berube; Jodi Nonnemacher; Cornelia Demsky; Shenly Glenn; Sadhvi Saxena; Amy Wright; Donna Tippett; Argye E. Hillis,"Purpose Our goal was to evaluate an updated version of the “Cookie Theft” picture by obtaining norms based on picture descriptions by healthy controls for total content units (CUs), syllables per CU, and the ratio of left–right CUs. In addition, we aimed to compare these measures from healthy controls to picture descriptions obtained from individuals with poststroke aphasia and primary progressive aphasia (PPA) to assess whether these measures can capture impairments in content and efficiency of communication. Method Using an updated version of this picture, we analyzed descriptions from 50 healthy controls to develop norms for numbers of syllables, total CUs, syllables per CU, and left–right CU. We provide preliminary data from 44 individuals with aphasia (19 with poststroke aphasia and 25 with PPA). Results A total of 96 CUs were established based on the written transcriptions of spoken picture descriptions of the 50 control participants. There was a significant effect of group on total CUs, syllables, syllables per CU, and left–right CUs. The poststroke participants produced significantly fewer total CU and syllables than those with PPA. Each aphasic group produced significantly fewer total CUs, fewer syllables, more syllables per CU, and lower left–right CUs (indicating a right-sided bias) compared to controls. Conclusions Results show that the measures of numbers of syllables, total CUs, syllables per CU, and left–right CUs can distinguish language output of individuals with aphasia from controls and capture impairments in content and efficiency of communication. A limitation of this study is that we evaluated only 44 individuals with aphasia. In the future, we will evaluate other measures, such as CUs per minute, lexical variability, grammaticality, and ratio of nouns to verbs.

The LITMUS Cross-Linguistic Lexical Tasks (CLT) provides a framework for assessing the vocabulary of monolingual and bilingual children using a standardized procedure and comparable stimuli across languages. All language versions of CLT include picture naming and picture recognition tasks, using both nouns and verbs as target words. The present study demonstrates high reliability (internal consistency) and convergent validity of the Polish CLT (CLT-PL) in a monolingual sample of children between 3 and 6 years of age. We present data collected from 479 participants. Based on the analysis of the impact of children’s demographic characteristics on CLT scores, we developed a set of monolingual norms for children aged 3;0 to 5;11. We conclude that the CLT-PL is a reliable and valid tool for assessing vocabulary in monolingual children that could be applied in research and has the potential to serve as a diagnostic tool in the future.

German in childhood and Latin in adolescence: On the bidialectal nature of lexical access in English,2021,10.1057/s41599-021-00836-4,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,Arturo E. Hernández; Juliana Ronderos; Jean Philippe Bodet; Hannah Claussenius‐Kalman; My Viet Ha Nguyen; Ferenc Bunta,"Abstract The nature of word etymology, long a topic of interest in linguistics, has been considered to a much lesser extent in the word recognition literature. The present study created a database of overlapping words from the English Lexicon Project (ELP) and a database with the age of acquisition (AoA) norms which were categorized as either Germanic or Latin-based. Results revealed that Germanic words were learned earlier than Latin-based words. Germanic words also showed slower reaction times and higher accuracy relative to Latin-based words even when controlling for AoA, word frequency, and length. Additionally, analyses were conducted using a publicly available database that used the English Crowdsourcing Project (ECP) data with native and second language (L2) English speakers. The results with native speakers were similar to those collected with the ELP. However, nonnative speakers showed better accuracy and faster reaction times for Latin-based words compared to Germanic words. The findings support a bidialectal view of English in that Germanic words serve as the base of lexical processing during childhood, whereas Latin-based words fill in the lexical space across adolescence and into early adulthood. Furthermore, L2 speakers appear to acquire English via more advanced Latin-based vocabulary relative to native speakers. These results carry implications for theories of word recognition and the processing of lexical items in populations that come from linguistically diverse backgrounds.","['Lexicon', 'German', 'Linguistics', 'Vocabulary', 'Etymology', 'Computer science', 'Cognate', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W3175200980,True,10,10.1057/s41599-021-00836-4,lexicon german linguistics vocabulary etymology computer science cognate natural language processing artificial intelligence psychology philosophy german childhood latin adolescence bidialectal nature lexical access english abstract nature word etymology long topic linguistics considered lesser extent word recognition literature present study created database overlapping words english lexicon project elp database age acquisition aoa norms categorized germanic latin based results revealed germanic words learned earlier latin based words germanic words showed slower reaction times higher accuracy relative latin based words controlling aoa word frequency length additionally analyses conducted using publicly available database used english crowdsourcing project ecp data native second language l english speakers results native speakers similar collected elp nonnative speakers showed better accuracy faster reaction times latin based words compared germanic words findings support bidialectal view english germanic words serve base lexical processing childhood latin based words lexical space adolescence early adulthood furthermore l speakers appear acquire english advanced latin based vocabulary relative native speakers results carry implications theories word recognition processing lexical items populations come linguistically diverse backgrounds,1
Child-oriented word associations improve models of early word learning,2022,10.3758/s13428-022-01790-y,Behavior Research Methods,Christopher R. Cox; Eileen Haebig,"Abstract How words are associated within the linguistic environment conveys semantic content; however, different contexts induce different linguistic patterns. For instance, it is well known that adults speak differently to children than to other adults. We present results from a new word association study in which adult participants were instructed to produce either unconstrained or child-oriented responses to each cue, where cues included 672 nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other word forms from the McArthur–Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI; Fenson et al., 2006). Child-oriented responses consisted of higher frequency words with fewer letters, earlier ages of acquisition, and higher contextual diversity. Furthermore, the correlations among the responses generated for each pair of cues differed between unconstrained (adult-oriented) and child-oriented responses, suggesting that child-oriented associations imply different semantic structure. A comparison of growth models guided by a semantic network structure revealed that child-oriented associations are more predictive of early lexical growth. Additionally, relative to a growth model based on a corpus of naturalistic child-directed speech, the child-oriented associations explain added unique variance to lexical growth. Thus, these new child-oriented word association norms provide novel insight into the semantic context of young children and early lexical development.","['Psychology', 'Lexical diversity', 'Vocabulary development', 'Association (psychology)', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Noun', 'Word Association', 'Language acquisition', 'Linguistics', 'Age of Acquisition', 'Word (group theory)', 'Mental lexicon', 'Lexicon', 'BATES', 'Language development', 'Vocabulary', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Cognition', 'Paleontology', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics education', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Engineering', 'Psychotherapist', 'Biology', 'Aerospace engineering']",https://openalex.org/W4220686168,True,12,10.3758/s13428-022-01790-y,psychology lexical diversity vocabulary development association psychology context archaeology noun word association language acquisition linguistics age acquisition word group theory mental lexicon lexicon bates language development vocabulary cognitive psychology developmental psychology cognition paleontology philosophy mathematics education neuroscience psychoanalysis engineering psychotherapist biology aerospace engineering child oriented word associations improve models early word learning abstract words associated linguistic environment conveys semantic content different contexts induce different linguistic patterns instance known adults speak differently children adults present results new word association study adult participants instructed produce unconstrained child oriented responses cue cues included nouns verbs adjectives word forms mcarthurbates communicative development inventory cdi fenson et al child oriented responses consisted higher frequency words fewer letters earlier ages acquisition higher contextual diversity furthermore correlations responses generated pair cues differed unconstrained adult oriented child oriented responses suggesting child oriented associations imply different semantic structure comparison growth models guided semantic network structure revealed child oriented associations predictive early lexical growth additionally relative growth model based corpus naturalistic child directed speech child oriented associations explain added unique variance lexical growth new child oriented word association norms provide novel insight semantic context young children early lexical development,1

Aligned with this need, we conducted several studies to propose an adaptation of ""The Comprehensive Aphasia Test"" (CAT) into Turkish.Methods During this adaptation process; (a) lexical/linguistic and visual stimuli in CAT's Language Battery subtests were evaluated by examining their imageability, familiarity, and name agreement features through rating studies, and two pilot studies for (b) Cognitive Screening and (c) Language Battery sections were carried out. In the stimuli norming studies, 71 undergraduate students (aged 20–24) rated 236 words in the Imageability and Familiarity tasks; 40 participants (aged 30–60) named 244 pictures in the Name Agreement task. Two sections of the CAT-TR were administered to different groups of subjects with aphasia (PWA) and matched controls. Fourteen PWA (and 14 controls) were presented the Cognitive Screening section, and a different group (PWA = 20, controls = 20) completed the Language Battery section.Results The imageability and familiarity ratings of 236 words and name agreement (% – H statistic) values of 244 pictures were calculated. Imageability and familiarity ratings of the words had a positive strong correlation with each other. Items with a name agreement of 85% or more were considered high name agreement. As anticipated, the control groups both in the Cognitive Screening and the Language Battery sections performed better than the PWA group. As a result, no further adaptive changes were suggested for these sections.Conclusion Results of these studies have shown that the Comprehensive Aphasia Test-Turkish is culturally and linguistically appropriate for Turkish speakers with aphasia.

Italian norms and naming latencies for 357 high quality color images,2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0209524,PLoS ONE,Eduardo Navarrete; Giorgio Arcara; Sara Mondini; Barbara Penolazzi,"In the domain of cognitive studies on the lexico-semantic representational system, one of the most important means of ensuring effective experimental designs is using ecological stimulus sets accompanied by normative data on the most relevant variables affecting the processing of their items. In the context of image sets, color photographs are particularly suited to this purpose as they reduce the difficulty of visual decoding processes that may emerge with traditional image sets of line drawings. This is especially so in clinical populations. In this study we provide Italian norms for a set of 357 high quality image-items belonging to 23 semantic subcategories from the Moreno-Martínez and Montoro database. Data from several variables affecting image processing were collected from a sample of 255 Italian-speaking participants: age of acquisition, familiarity, lexical frequency, manipulability, name agreement, typicality and visual complexity. Lexical frequency data were derived from the CoLFIS corpus. Furthermore, we collected data on image oral naming latencies to explore how the variance in these latencies could be explained by these critical variables. Multiple regression analyses on the naming latencies show classical psycholinguistic phenomena, such as the effects of age of acquisition and name agreement. In addition, manipulability was also a significant predictor.

Properties of Lexical Diversity in the Narratives of Children With Typical Language Development and Developmental Language Disorder,2020,10.1044/2020_ajslp-19-00176,American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology,Monique Charest; Melissa J.

The purpose was to document the properties of each measure with respect to variations in utterance and sample length, developmental trends, and group differences. Method The sample consisted of 377 picture-elicited, story generation transcripts from children with TLD ( n = 300) and DLD ( n = 77) aged 4–9 years. We extracted the moving-average type–token ratio (MATTR) and the number of different words from the full sample, from samples equated for the number of utterances, and from samples equated for the total number of words. Results MATTR was the only measure to show no relationships to utterance or sample length. All measures showed significant positive growth with age and significant groupwise differences between children with TLD and DLD. However, the magnitude of age effects and differentiation between groups varied considerably across measures. Across measures, there were significant differences in the number of children with DLD who were identified with low lexical diversity relative to their same-age peers in the TLD group. Conclusion The results of this study support the view that different measures of lexical diversity may be appropriate for different clinical purposes. It is important for clinicians to understand how measures of lexical diversity function in order to make educated choices among measures and ensure appropriate interpretation.","['Lexical diversity', 'Narrative', 'Psychology', 'Diversity (politics)', 'Sample (material)', 'Normative', 'Utterance', 'Mean length of utterance', 'Developmental psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Language development', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Chemistry', 'Epistemology', 'Chromatography', 'Vocabulary', 'Anthropology']",https://openalex.org/W3043090057,False,25,10.1044/2020_ajslp-19-00176,lexical diversity narrative psychology diversity politics sample material normative utterance mean length utterance developmental psychology linguistics language development sociology philosophy chemistry epistemology chromatography vocabulary anthropology properties lexical diversity narratives children typical language development developmental language disorder purpose examined measures lexical diversity narratives children typical language development tld developmental language disorder dld comprised normative sample edmonton narrative norms instrument schneider et al purpose document properties measure respect variations utterance sample length developmental trends group differences method sample consisted picture elicited story generation transcripts children tld n dld n aged years extracted moving average typetoken ratio mattr number different words sample samples equated number utterances samples equated total number words results mattr measure relationships utterance sample length measures showed significant positive growth age significant groupwise differences children tld dld magnitude age effects differentiation groups varied considerably measures measures significant differences number children dld identified low lexical diversity relative age peers tld group conclusion results study support view different measures lexical diversity appropriate different clinical purposes important clinicians understand measures lexical diversity function order make educated choices measures ensure appropriate interpretation,1
Category production norms for 117 concrete and abstract categories,2022,10.3758/s13428-021-01787-z,Behavior Research Methods,Briony Banks; Louise Connell,"Abstract We present a database of category production (aka semantic fluency) norms collected in the UK for 117 categories (67 concrete and 50 abstract). Participants verbally named as many category members as possible within 60 seconds, resulting in a large variety of over 2000 generated member concepts. The norms feature common measures of category production (production frequency, mean ordinal rank, first-rank frequency), as well as response times for all first-named category members, and typicality ratings collected from a separate participant sample. We provide two versions of the dataset: a referential version that groups together responses that relate to the same referent (e.g., hippo, hippopotamus ) and a full version that retains all original responses to enable future lexical analysis. Correlational analyses with previous norms from the USA and UK demonstrate both consistencies and differences in English-language norms over time and between geographical regions. Further exploration of the norms reveals a number of structural and psycholinguistic differences between abstract and concrete categories.

While the corpus features a range of single Vietnamese lexical items in otherwise English discourse, kin terms, as in the example below, are overwhelmingly the most frequent (accounting for 84%, 164/196, of single Vietnamese words in an English context).

Discourse distribution of the kin terms in terms of person reference and syntactic role are used as cross-language 'conflict sites', to determine the level of integration of such items as a test of their status as code-switches or borrowings. This reveals that the distribution of Vietnamese kin terms in an otherwise English context mirrors that of Vietnamese kin terms in monolingual Vietnamese, and is distinct from that of English kin terms. This measure of integration suggests that these may be single-word code-switches. Nonetheless, the high frequency of use and their diffusion across the community are suggestive of borrowings. Follow-up interviews with the participants reveal specific community norms that underlie the use of these terms, namely as a linguistic resource to retain, promote and conform to community cultural practice. While the paper acknowledges the difficulty in determining the exact status of these forms based on existing criteria, it demonstrates how judicious application of empirical methodology enables us to pinpoint such strategies in studying language in contact.","['Vietnamese', 'Code-switching', 'Linguistics', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Speech community', 'Code (set theory)', 'Computer science', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Archaeology', 'Philosophy', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Programming language']",https://openalex.org/W2896996371,False,10,10.1080/07268602.2018.1510727,vietnamese code switching linguistics context archaeology speech community code set theory computer science sociology psychology history archaeology philosophy set abstract data type programming language borrowing code switching traces community norms vietnamese english speech study explores use kin terms corpus vietnameseenglish bilingual spontaneous conversation corpus features range single vietnamese lexical items english discourse kin terms example overwhelmingly frequent accounting single vietnamese words english context borrowing code switching traces community norms vietnamese english speechall authorsli nguyen http orcid org https doi org published online october table download csvdisplay table study puts forward empirical attempt determining items considered code switches borrowings role pragmatic norms play shaping linguistic behaviour discourse distribution kin terms terms person reference syntactic role used cross language conflict sites determine level integration items test status code switches borrowings reveals distribution vietnamese kin terms english context mirrors vietnamese kin terms monolingual vietnamese distinct english kin terms measure integration suggests single word code switches nonetheless high frequency use diffusion community suggestive borrowings follow interviews participants reveal specific community norms underlie use terms linguistic resource retain promote conform community cultural practice paper acknowledges difficulty determining exact status forms based existing criteria demonstrates judicious application empirical methodology enables pinpoint strategies studying language contact,1

This study presents subjective ratings of age-of-acquisition (AoA), familiarity, imageability, concreteness, and semantic radical transparency in 4376 Chinese characters. The single Chinese characters were rated individually on the five dimensions by 20 native Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong to form the Hong Kong Chinese Character Psycholinguistic Norms (HKCCPN). The split-half reliability and intra-class correlations testified to the high internal reliability of the ratings. Their convergent and discriminant patterns in relations to other psycholinguistic measures echoed previous findings reported on Chinese. There were high correlations for semantic radical transparency, imageability and concreteness, and moderate-to-high correlations for AoA and familiarity among subsets of items that had been collected in previous studies. Concurrent validity analyses showed convergence in predicting behavioral response times in various tasks (lexical decision, naming, and writing-to-dictation) when compared with other Chinese character databases. High predictive validity was shown in writing-to-dictation data from an independent sample of 20 native Cantonese speakers. Several objective psycholinguistic measures (character frequency, stroke number, number of words formed, number of homophones and number of meanings) were included in this database to facilitate its use.

The first resource, the Concepticon, is a reference catalog for standardized concepts from linguistic research. While curating the Concepticon, we found that a variety of studies in distinct research fields collected information on word properties. However, until recently, no resource existed that contained these data to enable the comparison of the different word properties across languages. This gap was filled by the Database of Norms, Ratings, and Relations (NoRaRe), which is an extension of the Concepticon. Here, we present the major release of both resources - Concepticon Version 3.0 and NoRaRe Version 1.0 - which represents an important step in our data development. We show that extending and adapting the data curation workflow in Concepticon to NoRaRe is useful for the standardization of cross-linguistic datasets. In addition, combining datasets from different research fields enables studies grounded in language comparison. Concepticon and NoRaRe include lexical data for various languages, tools for test-driven data curation, and the possibility for data reuse. The first major release of NoRaRe is also accompanied by a new web application that allows convenient access to the data.","['Computer science', 'Standardization', 'Workflow', 'Variety (cybernetics)', 'Word (group theory)', 'Resource (disambiguation)', 'Reuse', 'Natural language processing', 'Information retrieval', 'Database', 'Data science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Linguistics', 'Computer network', 'Philosophy', 'Operating system', 'Ecology', 'Biology']",https://openalex.org/W4377984285,True,4,10.12688/openreseurope.15380.3,computer science standardization workflow variety cybernetics word group theory resource disambiguation reuse natural language processing information retrieval database data science artificial intelligence linguistics computer network philosophy operating ecology biology curating extending data language comparison concepticon norare language comparison requires user friendly tools facilitate standardization linguistic data present resources built basis standardized cross linguistic format data curated extended resource concepticon reference catalog standardized concepts linguistic research curating concepticon variety studies distinct research fields collected information word properties recently resource existed contained data enable comparison different word properties languages gap filled database norms ratings relations norare extension concepticon present major release resources concepticon version norare version represents important step data development extending adapting data curation workflow concepticon norare useful standardization cross linguistic datasets addition combining datasets different research fields enables studies grounded language comparison concepticon norare include lexical data various languages tools test driven data curation possibility data reuse major release norare accompanied new web application allows convenient access data,1
Sensorimotor norms for Chinese nouns and their relationship with orthographic and semantic variables,2022,10.1080/23273798.2022.2035416,Language Cognition and Neuroscience,Yin Zhong; Mingyu Wan; Kathleen Ahrens; Chu‐Ren Huang,"Sensorimotor information is vital to the conceptual representation of our knowledge system.

Semantic Relationships Between Representational Gestures and Their Lexical Affiliates Are Evaluated Similarly for Speech and Text,2020,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.575991,Frontiers in Psychology,Sarah S. Hughes-Berheim; Laura M.

In two studies, adult native English speakers rated the similarity of the meanings of representational gesture-word pairs presented via speech and text. Gesture-word pairs in each modality consisted of gestures and words matching in meaning (semantically-congruent pairs) as well as gestures and words mismatching in meaning (semantically-incongruent pairs). The results revealed that ratings differed by semantic congruency but not language modality. These findings provide the first evidence that semantic relationships between representational gestures and their lexical affiliates are evaluated similarly regardless of language modality.

Can large language models help augment English psycholinguistic datasets?,2024,10.3758/s13428-024-02337-z,Behavior Research Methods,Sean Trott,"Research on language and cognition relies extensively on psycholinguistic datasets or ""norms"". These datasets contain judgments of lexical properties like concreteness and age of acquisition, and can be used to norm experimental stimuli, discover empirical relationships in the lexicon, and stress-test computational models. However, collecting human judgments at scale is both time-consuming and expensive. This issue of scale is compounded for multi-dimensional norms and those incorporating context. The current work asks whether large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to augment the creation of large, psycholinguistic datasets in English. I use GPT-4 to collect multiple kinds of semantic judgments (e.g., word similarity, contextualized sensorimotor associations, iconicity) for English words and compare these judgments against the human ""gold standard"". For each dataset, I find that GPT-4's judgments are positively correlated with human judgments, in some cases rivaling or even exceeding the average inter-annotator agreement displayed by humans. I then identify several ways in which LLM-generated norms differ from human-generated norms systematically. I also perform several ""substitution analyses"", which demonstrate that replacing human-generated norms with LLM-generated norms in a statistical model does not change the sign of parameter estimates (though in select cases, there are significant changes to their magnitude). I conclude by discussing the considerations and limitations associated with LLM-generated norms in general, including concerns of data contamination, the choice of LLM, external validity, construct validity, and data quality. Additionally, all of GPT-4's judgments (over 30,000 in total) are made available online for further analysis.","['Concreteness', 'Computer science', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Lexicon', 'Cognition', 'Scale (ratio)', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Natural language processing', 'Age of Acquisition', 'Semantics (computer science)', 'Psychology', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Paleontology', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience', 'Biology', 'Programming language']",https://openalex.org/W4391132527,True,14,10.3758/s13428-024-02337-z,concreteness computer science cognitive psychology psycholinguistics lexicon cognition scale ratio context archaeology natural language processing age acquisition semantics computer science psychology artificial intelligence paleontology physics quantum mechanics neuroscience biology programming language large language models help augment english psycholinguistic datasets research language cognition relies extensively psycholinguistic datasets norms datasets contain judgments lexical properties like concreteness age acquisition used norm experimental stimuli discover empirical relationships lexicon stress test computational models collecting human judgments scale time consuming expensive issue scale compounded multi dimensional norms incorporating context current work asks large language models llms leveraged augment creation large psycholinguistic datasets english use gpt collect multiple kinds semantic judgments e g word similarity contextualized sensorimotor associations iconicity english words compare judgments human gold standard dataset gpt judgments positively correlated human judgments cases rivaling exceeding average inter annotator agreement displayed humans identify ways llm generated norms differ human generated norms systematically perform substitution analyses demonstrate replacing human generated norms llm generated norms statistical model does change sign parameter estimates select cases significant changes magnitude conclude discussing considerations limitations associated llm generated norms general including concerns data contamination choice llm external validity construct validity data quality additionally gpt judgments total available online analysis,1

We gathered and examined subjective ratings of emojis from 138 German speakers along five essential dimensions: valence, arousal, familiarity, clarity, and visual complexity. Additionally, we provide absolute frequency counts of emoji use, drawn from an extensive Twitter corpus, as well as a much smaller WhatsApp database. Our results replicate the well-established quadratic relationship between arousal and valence of lexical items, also known for words. We also report associations among the variables: for example, the subjective familiarity of an emoji is strongly correlated with its usage frequency, and positively associated with its emotional valence and clarity of meaning. We establish the meanings associated with face emojis, by asking participants for up to three descriptions for each emoji. Using this linguistic data, we computed vector embeddings for each emoji, enabling an exploration of their distribution within the semantic space. Our description-based emoji vector embeddings not only capture typical meaning components of emojis, such as their valence, but also surpass simple definitions and direct emoji2vec models in reflecting the semantic relationship between emojis and words. Our dataset stands out due to its robust reliability and validity.

This research aims to analyze the level of shift and change in the meaning of the lexicon for traditional technology systems in the Tolaki community in Konawe Regency, Southeast Sulawesi. The method is qualitative descriptive. The data are taken from written sources, literature studies, by examining and recording some lexicons from the book “Tolaki Culture” by Abdurrauf Tarimana related to the lexicon in the traditional technology system of the Tolaki community. The validation of the data is then substantiated by questionnaire distribution in which the informants fill in lexicon data about agricultural technology systems and imply them in Tolaki language.

""Englishes"" symbolizes variation in form and function, use in linguistically and culturally distinct contexts, and a range of variety in literary creativity.' As far as Chinese English is concerned, Kirkpatrick & Xu (2002: 278) suggest that since 'the great majority of the estimated 350 million Chinese' who have been learning English are far more likely to use it with other speakers of world Englishes, the development of Chinese English 'with Chinese characteristics' will be 'an inevitable result'. Kirkpatrick & Xu also predict that such a variety of English will be characterized by linguistic and cultural norms derived from Chinese. This chapter will review the definitions of Chinese English, and then identify a selection of lexical, syntactic, discourse and pragmatic features of Chinese English based on an analysis of a variety of data including interviews, newspaper articles, and literary works.

An Analysis of Lexico-Semantic Variations in Pakistani English Newspaper Corpus,2023,10.5430/wjel.v13n6p371,World Journal of English Language,Mahvish Nawaz Mokal; Hasliza Abd Halim,"The present study focuses on the corpus-based lexico-semantic analysis of Pakistani English to identify the variations in the language of newspapers. It also investigates how Pakistani English newspapers consider their readers' cultural and social ideals for intelligible contact while selecting language posts. As a result, they often deviate from the native norms of the language adopting many indigenous linguistic features and emerging new varieties of New English to define their tasks easier in order not only to facilitate but to attract people’s attention. Therefore, Moag’s model on New Englishes, Boas’s theory of cultural relativism, and Kachru’s Theory of Nativisation and Acculturation with the conception of the Outer Circle (1986) mainly connected to institutionalize Second Varieties of English have been used for the theoretical analysis within Pakistani context dependent socio-cultural scenario. The usage of these lexical items shows that Pakistani English is derived from the source, namely, Standard British English, for example, shadi hall, Jihadi outfits, etc. These lexical item categories followed in coinage, borrowing, idiomatic collocations, and semantic shift. This study also attempts to create lexicographical entries to represent the diverse Pakistani English and become available to society's educational and global communication. The study purposively compiled the 2 million corpora from the websites of two major Pakistani English Newspapers, The Nation and The News, and then analyzed it by using corpus software tools Antconc 3.5.8w to search for the key terms and to identify these elements of the stance. The study's finding highlights the New English variety of Pakistani English Newspapers and the adapted lexemes used in the local sociolinguistics context. One of the study's most significant findings shows that the New Englishes lexemes are infused with Islamic, historical, and social culture, highlighting the diverse local colours adapted to the Pakistani setting.

Concreteness effects have been found at both the brain and the behavioral levels, but they may vary depending on the constraints of the context and task demands. In this study, we collected concreteness norms for English and Italian words presented in different context sentences to allow better control and manipulation of concreteness in future psycholinguistic research. First, we observed high split-half correlations and Cronbach's alpha coefficients, suggesting that our ratings were highly reliable and can be used in Italian- and English-speaking populations. Second, our data indicate that the concreteness ratings are related to the lexical density and accessibility of the sentence in both English and Italian. We also found that the concreteness of words in isolation was highly correlated with that of words in context. Finally, we analyzed differences between nouns and verbs in concreteness ratings without significant effects. Our new concreteness norms of words in context are a valuable source of information for future research in both the English and Italian language.

Nymph piss and gravy orgies: Local and global contrast effects in relational humor.,2022,10.1037/xlm0001120,Journal of Experimental Psychology Learning Memory and Cognition,Cynthia S. Q. Siew; Tomas Engelthaler; Thomas T. Hills,"How does the relation between two words create humor? In this article, we investigated the effect of global and local contrast on the humor of word pairs. We capitalized on the existence of psycholinguistic lexical norms by examining violations of expectations set up by typical patterns of English usage (global contrast) and within the local context of the words within the word pairs (local contrast). Global contrast was operationalized as lexical-semantic norms for single-words and local contrast was operationalized as the orthographic, phonological, and semantic distance between the two words in the pair. Through crowd-sourced (Study 1) and best-worst (Study 2) ratings of the humor of a large set of word pairs (i.e., compounds), we find evidence of both global and local contrast on compound-word humor. Specifically, we find that humor arises when there is a violation of expectations at the local level, between the individual words that make up the word pair, even after accounting for violations at the global level relative to the entire language. Semantic variables (arousal, dominance, and concreteness) were stronger predictors of word pair humor whereas form-related variables (number of letters, phonemes, and letter frequency) were stronger predictors of single-word humor. Moreover, we also find that semantic dissimilarity increases humor, by defusing the impact of low-valence words-making them seem more amusing-and by enhancing the incongruence of highly imageable pairs of concrete words.

"Subjective age of acquisition norms for 1604 English words by Spanish L2 speakers of English and their relationship with lexico-semantic, affective, sociolinguistic and proficiency variables",2022,10.3758/s13428-022-02026-9,Behavior Research Methods,Sara Rodríguez‐Cuadrado; José Antonio Hinojosa; Marc Guasch; Carlos Romero-Rivas; Lucía Sabater; Paz Suárez‐Coalla; Pilar Ferré,"Psycholinguistic studies have shown that there are many variables implicated in language comprehension and production. At the lexical level, subjective age of acquisition (AoA), the estimate of the age at which a word is acquired, is key for stimuli selection in psycholinguistic studies. AoA databases in English are often used when testing a variety of phenomena in second language (L2) speakers of English. However, these have limitations, as the norms are not provided by the target population (L2 speakers of English) but by native English speakers. In this study, we asked native Spanish L2 speakers of English to provide subjective AoA ratings for 1604 English words, and investigated whether factors related to 14 lexico-semantic and affective variables, both in Spanish and English, and to the speakers' profile (i.e., sociolinguistic variables and L2 proficiency), were related to the L2 AoA ratings.

"English Verbs Semantic Norms Database: Concreteness, Embodiment, Imageability, Valence and Arousal Ratings for 2,900 Verbs",2024,10.31234/osf.io/wqsjc,,Emiko J. Muraki; Penny M. Pexman,"Semantic ratings studies have resulted in significant methodological advances towards understanding the importance of experiential information to lexical-semantic processing. Yet, the existing norms are biased towards nouns, with fewer ratings available for verbs. In the present study we collected new semantic rating norms for 2,937 verbs on the dimensions of concreteness, embodiment, imageability, valence, and arousal. The resulting ratings provide the largest database of verb-specific rating norms across multiple semantic dimensions. They show good reliability and validity on four of five dimensions, with some evident challenges rating arousal for the verb stimuli. We demonstrate that the norms account for variance in response latencies and accuracy in a lexical decision task, word recognition task, and recognition memory, above and beyond dimensions such as length, frequency, orthographic Levenshtein distance, and age of acquisition, and suggests that semantic richness effects are observed in verb processing. The norms described here should be a useful resource for researchers interested in verb lexical-semantic processing.","['Concreteness', 'Valence (chemistry)', 'Psychology', 'Arousal', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Emotional valence', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Computer science', 'Social psychology', 'Cognition', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience']",https://openalex.org/W4393375535,True,3,10.31234/osf.io/wqsjc,concreteness valence chemistry psychology arousal natural language processing linguistics emotional valence cognitive psychology computer science social psychology cognition philosophy physics quantum mechanics neuroscience english verbs semantic norms database concreteness embodiment imageability valence arousal ratings verbs semantic ratings studies resulted significant methodological advances understanding importance experiential information lexical semantic processing existing norms biased nouns fewer ratings available verbs present study collected new semantic rating norms verbs dimensions concreteness embodiment imageability valence arousal resulting ratings provide largest database verb specific rating norms multiple semantic dimensions good reliability validity dimensions evident challenges rating arousal verb stimuli demonstrate norms account variance response latencies accuracy lexical decision task word recognition task recognition memory dimensions length frequency orthographic levenshtein distance age acquisition suggests semantic richness effects observed verb processing norms described useful resource researchers interested verb lexical semantic processing,1
Perceptual modality norms for 1121 Italian words: a comparison with concreteness and imageability scores and an analysis of their impact in word processing tasks.,2019,10.31234/osf.io/zhcy4,,Alessandra Vergallito; Marco A. Petilli; Marco Marelli,"Normative measures of verbal material are fundamental in psycholinguistic and cognitive research to control for confounding in experimental procedures and achieve a better comprehension of our conceptual system. Traditionally, normative studies focused on classical psycholinguistic variables, such as concreteness and imageability. Recent works shifted researchers’ focus to perceptual strength, in which items are separately rated for each of the five senses.We present a resource including perceptual norms for 1121 Italian words extracted from the Italian version of ANEW. Norms were collected from 57 native-speakers. For each word, participants provided perceptual strength ratings for each of the five perceptual modalities. Perceptual norms performance in predicting human behavior was tested in two novel experiments, a lexical decision and a naming task. Concreteness, imageability and different composite variables representing perceptual strength scores were considered as competing predictors in a series of linear regressions, evaluating the goodness-of-fit of each model.For both tasks, the model with imageability as predictor was found to be the best fitting model according to AIC, while the model with the separately considered five modalities better described data according to the explained variance. These results differ from the ones previously reported for English, in which maximum perceptual strength emerged as the best predictor of behavior. We investigated this discrepancy by comparing Italian and English data on the same set of translated items, thus confirming a genuine cross-linguistic effect. We conclude confirming that perceptual experience influences linguistic processing, even though evaluations from different languages are needed to generalize this claim.","['Concreteness', 'Normative', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Psychology', 'Perception', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Age of Acquisition', 'Modalities', 'Lexical decision task', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Comprehension', 'Cognition', 'Linguistics', 'Computer science', 'Social science', 'Philosophy', 'Epistemology', 'Neuroscience', 'Sociology', 'Programming language']",https://openalex.org/W4239681910,True,4,10.31234/osf.io/zhcy4,concreteness normative cognitive psychology psychology perception psycholinguistics age acquisition modalities lexical decision task set abstract data type comprehension cognition linguistics computer science social science philosophy epistemology neuroscience sociology programming language perceptual modality norms italian words comparison concreteness imageability scores analysis impact word processing tasks normative measures verbal material fundamental psycholinguistic cognitive research control confounding experimental procedures achieve better comprehension conceptual traditionally normative studies focused classical psycholinguistic variables concreteness imageability recent works shifted researchers focus perceptual strength items separately rated senses present resource including perceptual norms italian words extracted italian version anew norms collected native speakers word participants provided perceptual strength ratings perceptual modalities perceptual norms performance predicting human behavior tested novel experiments lexical decision naming task concreteness imageability different composite variables representing perceptual strength scores considered competing predictors series linear regressions evaluating goodness fit model tasks model imageability predictor best fitting model according aic model separately considered modalities better described data according explained variance results differ ones previously reported english maximum perceptual strength emerged best predictor behavior investigated discrepancy comparing italian english data set translated items confirming genuine cross linguistic effect conclude confirming perceptual experience influences linguistic processing evaluations different languages needed generalize claim,1

While curating the Concepticon, we found that a variety of studies in distinct research fields collected information on word properties. However, until recently, no resource existed that contained these data to enable the comparison of the different word properties across languages.

Accordingly, the first database of Serbian homonyms was constructed containing subjective meanings of homonymous nouns along with the estimated meaning probabilities, as well as a number of meanings, redundancy and entropy of the distribution of meaning probabilities, word familiarity and word concreteness. The processing disadvantage of homonymous nouns over unambiguous nouns was replicated in the visual lexical decision task. Additionally, the processing of homonymous nouns was linked with redundancy: the information theory measure of the balance of meaning probabilities. The results revealed that homonyms with higher redundancy of the meaning probability distribution (i.e., unbalanced meaning probabilities) were processed faster. This finding was in accordance with the hypothesis derived from the Semantic Settling Dynamics account of the processing of ambiguous words, according to which the competition among the unrelated meanings derived the processing disadvantage in homonymy. However, the same pattern was not observed for the number of meanings and entropy, inviting for further research of the processing of ambiguous words.","['Concreteness', 'Noun', 'Lexical decision task', 'Linguistics', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Psychology', 'Serbian', 'Adjective', 'Redundancy (engineering)', 'Ambiguity', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Cognition', 'Philosophy', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychotherapist', 'Operating system']",https://openalex.org/W2978621721,True,5,10.19090/pp.2019.3.283-304,concreteness noun lexical decision task linguistics meaning existential psychology serbian adjective redundancy engineering ambiguity natural language processing artificial intelligence computer science cognitive psychology cognition philosophy neuroscience psychotherapist operating balance meaning probabilities processing serbian homonymy research deals set serbian homonymous nouns nouns multiple unrelated meanings presented norming study visual lexical decision task experiment native speakers listed meanings homonymous words provided word familiarity word concreteness ratings accordingly database serbian homonyms constructed containing subjective meanings homonymous nouns estimated meaning probabilities number meanings redundancy entropy distribution meaning probabilities word familiarity word concreteness processing disadvantage homonymous nouns unambiguous nouns replicated visual lexical decision task additionally processing homonymous nouns linked redundancy information theory measure balance meaning probabilities results revealed homonyms higher redundancy meaning probability distribution e unbalanced meaning probabilities processed faster finding accordance hypothesis derived semantic settling dynamics account processing ambiguous words according competition unrelated meanings derived processing disadvantage homonymy pattern observed number meanings entropy inviting research processing ambiguous words,1
"Quantifying Social Semantics: An Inclusive Definition of Socialness and Ratings for 8,388 English Words",2021,10.31234/osf.io/6xnzg,,Veronica Diveica; Penny M. Pexman; Richard J. Binney,"It has been proposed that social experience plays an important role in the grounding of concepts, and socialness has been proffered as a fundamental organisational principle underpinning semantic representation in the human brain. However, the empirical support for these hypotheses is limited by inconsistencies in the way socialness has been defined and measured. To further advance theory, the field must establish a clearer working definition, and research efforts could be facilitated by the availability of an extensive set of socialness ratings for individual concepts. Therefore, in the current work we employed a novel and inclusive definition to test the extent to which socialness is reliably perceived as a broad construct, and we report socialness norms for over 8,000 English words, including nouns, verbs and adjectives. Our inclusive socialness measure shows good reliability and validity, and our analyses suggest that the socialness ratings capture aspects of word meaning which are distinct to those measured by other pertinent semantic constructs, including concreteness and emotional valence. Finally, in a series of regression analyses, we show for the first time that the socialness of a word's meaning explains unique variance in participant performance on lexical tasks. Our dataset of socialness norms has considerable item overlap with those used both in other lexical/semantic norms and in available behavioural mega-studies.

Category Exemplar Production Norms for Hong Kong Cantonese: Instance Probabilities and Word Familiarity,2021,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.657706,Frontiers in Psychology,Bing Li; Qiduo Lin; Hoi Yan Mak; Ovid J. L. Tzeng; Chih‐Mao Huang; Feng‐Ying Huang,"The lexical system of Hong Kong Cantonese has been heavily shaped by the local trilingual environment. The development of cultural- and language-specific norms for Hong Kong Cantonese is fundamental for understanding how the speaker population organize semantic memory, how they utilize their semantic resources, and what information processing strategies they use for the retrieval of semantic knowledge. This study presents a normative database of 72 lexical categories in Hong Kong Cantonese produced by native speakers in a category exemplar production task. Exemplars are enlisted under a category label, along with the instance probabilities and word familiarity scores. Possible English equivalents are given to the exemplars for the convenience of non-HKC speaker researchers. Statistics on categories were further extracted to capture the heterogeneity of the categories: the total number of valid exemplars, the number of exemplars covering 90% of the occurrence and the probabilities of the most frequent exemplars in each category. The database offers a direct lexical sketch of the vocabulary of modern Hong Kong Cantonese in a categorical structure. The category-exemplar lists and the comparative statistics together lay the foundations for further investigations on the Hong Kong Cantonese speaking population from multiple disciplines, such as the structure of semantic knowledge, the time-course of knowledge access, and the processing strategies of young adults. Results of this norm can be also used as a benchmark for other age groups. The database can serve as a crucial resource for establishing initial screening tests to assess the cognitive and psychological functioning of the Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong population in both educational and clinical settings.

In this study, we expanded Tse et al.’s (Behav Res Methods 49:1503–1519, 2017; Behav Res Methods 55:4382–4402, 2023) Chinese Lexicon Project by norming five word dimensions (valence, arousal, familiarity, concreteness, and imageability) for over 25,000 two-character Chinese words presented in traditional script. Through regression models that controlled for other variables, we examined the relationships among these dimensions. We included ambiguity, quantified by the standard deviation of the ratings of a given lexical variable across different raters, as separate variables (e.g., valence ambiguity) to explore their connections with other variables. The intensity–ambiguity relationships (i.e., between normed variables and their ambiguities, like valence with valence ambiguity) were also examined. In these analyses with a large pool of words and controlling for other lexical variables, we replicated the asymmetric U-shaped valence–arousal relationship, which was moderated by valence and arousal ambiguities. We also observed a curvilinear relationship between valence and familiarity and between valence and concreteness. Replicating Brainerd et al.’s (J Exp Psychol Gen 150:1476–1499, 2021; J Mem Lang 121:104286, 2021) quadratic intensity–ambiguity relationships, we found that the ambiguity of valence, arousal, concreteness, and imageability decreases as the value of these variables is extremely low or extremely high, although this was not generalized to familiarity. While concreteness and imageability were strongly correlated, they displayed different relationships with arousal, valence, familiarity, and valence ambiguity, suggesting their distinct conceptual nature.

"The development of a novel, standardized, norm‐referenced Arabic Discourse Assessment Tool (ADAT), including an examination of psychometric properties of discourse measures in aphasia",2024,10.1111/1460-6984.13083,International Journal of Language & Communication Disorders,Reem S. W. Alyahya,"Abstract Background People with aphasia (PWA) typically exhibit deficits in spoken discourse. Discourse analysis is the gold standard approach to assess language deficits beyond sentence level. However, the available discourse assessment tools are biased towards English and European languages and Western culture. Additionally, there is a lack of consensus on which discourse measures to use and limited evidence of the psychometric properties of published discourse measurements. Aims (1) To develop a standardized, norm‐referenced, culturally and linguistically appropriate Arabic Discourse Assessment Tool (ADAT); and (2) to examine the psychometric properties of content and construct validity and interrater reliability of different discourse measures elicited using three discourse genres (descriptive, narrative and procedural) in neurotypical control adults and matched PWA. Methods &amp; Procedures Discourse samples were collected using three novel discourse stimuli that are sensitive to the Arabic language and culture from 70 neurotypical control adults and a matched group of 50 PWA. Transcription agreement was assessed. A standard approach was used to evaluate construct validity and interrater reliability for 16 discourse measures that assess fluency, language productivity, information content, lexical–semantics, lexical diversity, grammatical category, grammatical structure and syntactic complexity. Strong measures were identified based on their psychometric properties, and normative data were established on these measures. Discourse performance of PWA was then examined using the newly developed tool (ADAT). Outcomes &amp; Results Transcription agreement was extremely high for all discourse stimuli in both groups. Eight discourse measures were proven to have consistently very high construct validity and consistently very good to excellent reliability across the three stimuli in both neurotypical control and aphasia groups: lexical information units, content information units, words per minute, discourse duration, number of different words, number of complete sentences and proportion of open and closed class words. Norms were established on these measures, and cut‐off scores of impairments were determined. Other measures showed low construct validity and variable or poor reliability across the two groups. Conclusions &amp; Implications The newly developed, standardized, and norm‐referenced tool (ADAT) consist of three discourse stimuli and eight high‐quality discourse measures that assess multiple aspects of spoken discourse and were able to differentiate PWA from neurotypical adults consistently. ADAT also includes normative data and cut‐off impairment scores. The tool has great potential to enhance clinical practice and research with Arabic speakers. Evidence was provided that not all discourse measures are of high quality, as some are vulnerable to differences between raters, discourse stimuli and groups. Clinicians and researchers can use ADAT for accurate aphasia assessments, better management plans and to monitor therapy effectiveness. ADAT can be further validated in other clinical populations with language impairments. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS What is already known on the subject Discourse analysis is the gold standard approach to assess language deficits beyond sentence level. However, existing discourse assessment tools are biased towards English and European languages and Western culture. Additionally, there is a lack of consensus on which discourse measures to use in aphasia, and limited evidence of the psychometric properties of published discourse measurements. What this paper adds to existing knowledge A novel, standardized, norm‐referenced Arabic Discourse Assessment Tool (ADAT) was developed and validated in this study. ADAT was further validated among PWA. The study provides evidence that not all discourse measures are of high quality and thus should not be used with confidence. Specific measures are vulnerable to the type of stimuli, the rater and/or the tested group. On the other hand, eight discourse measures were identified to be reliable between different raters and across different stimuli for the two groups, and they were able to differentiate the discourse performance of PWA from neurotypical control adults. Normative data derived from neurotypical control adults were established on these strong measures, and the performance of PWA was classified as impaired based on these norms. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The present study provides a novel, standardized, norm‐referenced, validated discourse assessment tool that is culturally and linguistically appropriate for use by Arabic speakers (ADAT). ADAT holds immense potential to enhance clinical practice and research with Arabic speakers. The study also identified strong discourse measures that can be used to assess language productivity, information content, lexical–semantics, lexical diversity, grammatical category, and syntactic complexity for accurate and comprehensive assessments. This will lead to better rehabilitation management by guiding the development of tailored client‐centred interventions. ADAT can be utilized in clinical and research settings in PWA and has the potential to be further validated with other clinical populations.","['Psychology', 'Inter-rater reliability', 'Linguistics', 'Construct validity', 'Aphasia', 'Discourse analysis', 'Normative', 'Content validity', 'Neurotypical', 'Psychometrics', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Rating scale', 'Autism spectrum disorder', 'Philosophy', 'Epistemology', 'Autism']",https://openalex.org/W4399785527,True,3,10.1111/1460-6984.13083,psychology inter rater reliability linguistics construct validity aphasia discourse analysis normative content validity neurotypical psychometrics cognitive psychology developmental psychology rating scale autism spectrum disorder philosophy epistemology autism development novel standardized normreferenced arabic discourse assessment tool adat including examination psychometric properties discourse measures aphasia abstract background people aphasia pwa typically exhibit deficits spoken discourse discourse analysis gold standard approach assess language deficits sentence level available discourse assessment tools biased english european languages western culture additionally lack consensus discourse measures use limited evidence psychometric properties published discourse measurements aims develop standardized normreferenced culturally linguistically appropriate arabic discourse assessment tool adat examine psychometric properties content construct validity interrater reliability different discourse measures elicited using discourse genres descriptive narrative procedural neurotypical control adults matched pwa methods amp procedures discourse samples collected using novel discourse stimuli sensitive arabic language culture neurotypical control adults matched group pwa transcription agreement assessed standard approach used evaluate construct validity interrater reliability discourse measures assess fluency language productivity information content lexicalsemantics lexical diversity grammatical category grammatical structure syntactic complexity strong measures identified based psychometric properties normative data established measures discourse performance pwa examined using newly developed tool adat outcomes amp results transcription agreement extremely high discourse stimuli groups discourse measures proven consistently high construct validity consistently good excellent reliability stimuli neurotypical control aphasia groups lexical information units content information units words minute discourse duration number different words number complete sentences proportion open closed class words norms established measures cutoff scores impairments determined measures showed low construct validity variable poor reliability groups conclusions amp implications newly developed standardized normreferenced tool adat consist discourse stimuli highquality discourse measures assess multiple aspects spoken discourse able differentiate pwa neurotypical adults consistently adat includes normative data cutoff impairment scores tool great potential enhance clinical practice research arabic speakers evidence provided discourse measures high quality vulnerable differences raters discourse stimuli groups clinicians researchers use adat accurate aphasia assessments better management plans monitor therapy effectiveness adat validated clinical populations language impairments paper adds known subject discourse analysis gold standard approach assess language deficits sentence level existing discourse assessment tools biased english european languages western culture additionally lack consensus discourse measures use aphasia limited evidence psychometric properties published discourse measurements paper adds existing knowledge novel standardized normreferenced arabic discourse assessment tool adat developed validated study adat validated pwa study provides evidence discourse measures high quality used confidence specific measures vulnerable type stimuli rater tested group hand discourse measures identified reliable different raters different stimuli groups able differentiate discourse performance pwa neurotypical control adults normative data derived neurotypical control adults established strong measures performance pwa classified impaired based norms potential actual clinical implications work present study provides novel standardized normreferenced validated discourse assessment tool culturally linguistically appropriate use arabic speakers adat adat holds immense potential enhance clinical practice research arabic speakers study identified strong discourse measures used assess language productivity information content lexicalsemantics lexical diversity grammatical category syntactic complexity accurate comprehensive assessments lead better rehabilitation management guiding development tailored clientcentred interventions adat utilized clinical research settings pwa potential validated clinical populations,1
Category Production Norms for 117 Concrete and Abstract Categories,2021,10.31234/osf.io/7peqx,,Briony Banks; Louise Connell,"We present a database of category production (aka semantic fluency) norms collected in the UK for 117 categories (67 concrete and 50 abstract). Participants verbally named as many category members as possible within 60 seconds, resulting in a large variety of over 2000 generated member concepts. The norms feature common measures of category production (production frequency, mean ordinal rank, first rank frequency), as well as response times for all first-named category members, and typicality ratings collected from a separate participant sample. We provide two versions of the dataset: a referential version that groups together responses that relate to the same referent (e.g., hippo, hippopotamus) and a full version that retains all original responses to enable future lexical analysis. Correlational analyses with previous norms from the US and UK demonstrate both consistencies and differences in English-language norms over time and between geographical regions.

ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF EFFECTIVE ACADEMIC WRITING IN ENGLISH,2021,10.31718/mep.2021.25.1-2.10,The Medical and Ecological Problems,Yu. V. Lysanets; Олена Миколаївна Бєляєва; Л. Б. Сліпченко; K. H. Havrylieva; Halyna Yu. Morokhovets,"The article discusses the features of academic writing in English based on the recommendations from the British Council in Ukraine in the framework of the “Researcher Connect” project, aiming to facilitate the transition to academic standards of English and improve the academic discourse produced by non-native language users. The authors outline major tendencies in the modern English language as pertains to written discourse and provide recommendations for rendering academic writing persuasive. It is a well-established fact that academic writing in English possesses unique features, which must be respected and taken into account. Hence, a transfer of academic norms from a person's mother tongue to English can be a challenge, which may impair the quality of academic writing. Presenting the research results without consideration of academic norms, grammar, and lexical features of English academic writing can lead to mistakes and misunderstanding, and result in a written work of poor quality, even if the research findings are valid. The mechanisms of improving the academic writing skills during the study of English for Academic Communication with due account for relevant grammar and lexical peculiarities have been explored. Therefore, the major challenge for researchers is the difficulty in transition to academic standards of a foreign language. The article discusses the surface and the deeper purposes in any academic writing; the significance of understanding one’s audience; the concepts of persuasion, clarity, and conciseness, as well as grammar and lexical means for achieving them. Developing the communication skills of Ukrainian scientists is crucial for successful international communication and cooperation. The study of potential difficulties, which the Ukrainian medical professionals may face in the process of academic writing in English, is important for developing the guidelines to eliminate possible mistakes and avoid misunderstanding in a medical setting. Further study of the peculiarities of academic writing in English will contribute to the optimization of international professional communication, the expansion of inter-institutional dialogue, and the integration of Ukraine into the world community.","['Academic writing', 'Grammar', 'English for academic purposes', 'CLARITY', 'Professional writing', 'Foreign language', 'English studies', 'Standard English', 'Linguistics', 'Persuasion', 'Computer science', 'Psychology', 'Mathematics education', 'Pedagogy', 'Biochemistry', 'Philosophy', 'Chemistry']",https://openalex.org/W3157603393,True,5,10.31718/mep.2021.25.1-2.10,academic writing grammar english academic purposes clarity professional writing foreign language english studies standard english linguistics persuasion computer science psychology mathematics education pedagogy biochemistry philosophy chemistry essential features effective academic writing english article discusses features academic writing english based recommendations british council ukraine framework researcher connect project aiming facilitate transition academic standards english improve academic discourse produced non native language users authors outline major tendencies modern english language pertains written discourse provide recommendations rendering academic writing persuasive established fact academic writing english possesses unique features respected taken account transfer academic norms person mother tongue english challenge impair quality academic writing presenting research results consideration academic norms grammar lexical features english academic writing lead mistakes misunderstanding result written work poor quality research findings valid mechanisms improving academic writing skills study english academic communication account relevant grammar lexical peculiarities explored major challenge researchers difficulty transition academic standards foreign language article discusses surface deeper purposes academic writing significance understanding ones audience concepts persuasion clarity conciseness grammar lexical means achieving developing communication skills ukrainian scientists crucial successful international communication cooperation study potential difficulties ukrainian medical professionals face process academic writing english important developing guidelines eliminate possible mistakes avoid misunderstanding medical setting study peculiarities academic writing english contribute optimization international professional communication expansion inter institutional dialogue integration ukraine world community,1

Lexical connectivity effects in immediate serial recall of words.,2021,10.1037/xlm0001089,Journal of Experimental Psychology Learning Memory and Cognition,Matthew HC Mak; Yaling Hsiao; Kate Nation,"In six experiments, we tested whether immediate serial recall is influenced by a word's degree centrality, an index of lexical connectivity. Words of high degree centrality are associated with more words in free association norms than those of low degree centrality. Experiment 1 analyzed secondary data to explore the effect of degree centrality in wordlists containing a mixture of high- and low-degree words. High-degree words were advantaged across all serial positions, independently of other variables including word frequency. Experiment 2 replicated this finding using an expanded stimulus set. Experiment 3 used pure lists with each list containing high- or low-degree words only (e.g., HHHHHH vs. LLLLLL). Once again, high-degree words were better recalled across all serial positions. In Experiment 4, each wordlist alternated between high and low-degree words (e.g., HLHLHL and LHLHLH). Recall of low-degree words was facilitated by the neighboring high-degree words, abolishing the overall high-degree advantage. Experiment 5 used a within-participant design and replicated the findings from Experiments 3 and 4 such that the high-degree advantage in pure lists disappeared in alternating lists. Experiment 6 compared high and low frequency words in pure lists while controlling for degree centrality between the item sets. A high-frequency advantage emerged, suggesting that the effects of frequency and degree centrality are separable. We conclude that degree centrality is a distinct psycholinguistic variable that affects serial recall as both (a) an item-level characteristic such that high (vs. low) degree words have greater accessibility in the lexicon and (b) an interitem property such that high-degree words facilitate the recall of neighboring words by enhancing the formation of associative links.

A Descriptive Analysis of Non-obligatory Shifts in Three Disney Animated Films Dubbed into Modern Standard Arabic,2022,10.31235/osf.io/u8njp,,Dana Sulaiman AlSuhaim,"This qualitative quantitative descriptive-analytical study aimed to describe the non-obligatory shifts employed in three English Disney animated films dubbed into MSA by applying Toury’s (1995/2012) normative model and shifts introduced in the course of his applied case studies. The researcher described and analyzed preliminary, initial and operational norms (non-obligatory shifts) employed on the level of three textual segments: the lexical-semantic, the stylistic, and the prosodic. The researcher compared those shifts with the original choices in the English versions of three selected Disney animated films. In the light of Toury’s theory (1995/2012), the current study investigated the hypothesis that the accepted socio-cultural, ideological, and linguistic norms of the Arabic culture directed the choices of the non-obligatory shifts chosen by the Arabic dubbers of English Disney animations dubbed into MSA. This investigation was conducted in application to three case studies, namely, Tangled (2010), Frozen (2013) and Big Hero 6 (2014). In order to decide the most frequently used shifts in the process of dubbing, the frequency rate of each non-obligatory shift was calculated to determine the highest frequently used shift. The study came to the conclusion that there is a direct relationship between the non-obligatory shifts (operational norms) applied during dubbing on the one hand and the socio-cultural, ideological, and linguistic norms imposed by the target culture on the other hand. Those target culture norms governed not only the operational choices but also the preliminary choices of the three selected Disney animated films dubbed into MSA. Affected by the preliminary and operational norms, Arab dubbers’ tendency towards producing acceptable rather than adequate translations decided the initial norms.","['Ideology', 'Normative', 'Linguistics', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Arabic', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Philosophy', 'Archaeology', 'Politics']",https://openalex.org/W4226378557,True,1,10.31235/osf.io/u8njp,ideology normative linguistics context archaeology arabic sociology psychology history political science law philosophy archaeology politics descriptive analysis non obligatory shifts disney animated films dubbed modern standard arabic qualitative quantitative descriptive analytical study aimed non obligatory shifts employed english disney animated films dubbed msa applying tourys normative model shifts introduced course applied case studies researcher described analyzed preliminary initial operational norms non obligatory shifts employed level textual segments lexical semantic stylistic prosodic researcher compared shifts original choices english versions selected disney animated films light tourys theory current study investigated hypothesis accepted socio cultural ideological linguistic norms arabic culture directed choices non obligatory shifts chosen arabic dubbers english disney animations dubbed msa investigation conducted application case studies tangled frozen big hero order decide frequently used shifts process dubbing frequency rate non obligatory shift calculated determine highest frequently used shift study came conclusion direct relationship non obligatory shifts operational norms applied dubbing hand socio cultural ideological linguistic norms imposed target culture hand target culture norms governed operational choices preliminary choices selected disney animated films dubbed msa affected preliminary operational norms arab dubbers tendency producing acceptable adequate translations decided initial norms,1
The Canto-Lexicon Project: A Preliminary Report,2019,10.3389/conf.fnhum.2019.01.00061,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,Dustin Kai-Yan Lau; I-Fan Su; Yen Na Yum,"Event Abstract Back to Event The Canto-Lexicon Project: A Preliminary Report Kai-Yan Dustin Lau1*, I-Fan Su2 and Yen-Na Cherry Yum3 1 Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, SAR China 2 The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR China 3 The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR China Introduction. There are subtle differences in the orthographic and phonological forms of the Chinese language used in Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, traditional characters and Cantonese are used. Previous database projects conducted in Mainland China (Liu, Shu, & Li, 2007) and Taiwan (Chang, Hsu, Tsai, Chen & Lee, 2016) have documented the significance of different psycholinguistic variables in predicting character recognition. In the current study, preliminary data of the Canto-Lexicon Project conducted using traditional characters and Cantonese are reported. Methods. In the Canto-Lexicon Project, a total of 4376 most frequently found traditional characters (3327 of them are phonetic compounds [PC] and 1049 are non-phonetic compounds [nonPC]) in newspapers in Hong Kong (Leung & Lau, 2010) were selected as stimuli. An equal number of pseudo-characters were constructed by shuffling the constituent radicals of the target characters for a lexical decision task. Twenty undergraduates (age ranged from 19 to 22 years old, gender balanced, with no prior linguistic training and literacy problem reported) were recruited for both a lexical decision task and a character naming task. Another twenty undergraduates were recruited to give ratings of (1) Imageability (IMG), (2) Age of Acquisition (AoA), (3) Concreteness, and (4) Familiarity of each of the real characters. Measures of character frequency, radical frequency, phonetic regularity, phonetic consistency, homophone number and stroke number of each selected character were obtained from the Hong Kong Corpus of Chinese News-Paper (Leung & Lau, 2010). In this study, the data of 14 participants in the lexical decision task together with the rating data of IMG and AoA were analyzed using linear mixed effects modeling. Two models were fitted: Model 1 using RT data of both PC and nonPC and Model 2 using RT data of PC only. Results. Results showed that in Model 1, after controlling for the session order and the within-session presentation order, effects of stroke number, frequency, AoA and IMG, and two-way interactions between frequency and AoA, AoA and IMG, and frequency and IMG significantly predicted the RT. In Model 2, after controlling for the session order and the within-session presentation order, similar effects to Model 1 in addition to phonetic regularity and interactions among frequency, AoA and phonetic regularity significantly predicted the RT. Discussion. Results of Model 1 indicated that in the lexical decision task, character recognition is affected by both lexical and semantic factors. Results of Model 2 added that a phonological effect is significant in lexical decision for Chinese phonetic compounds. In general, results of both models are consistent with previous reports regarding the roles of different psycholinguistic variables in character recognition. Data collection is still in progress and results of additional analyses will be presented. Implications for theories of lexical processing in Chinese will also be discussed.

The pragmatic view on dual character concepts and expressions,2024,10.1111/mila.12505,Mind & Language,Lucien Baumgartner,"This article introduces a new pragmatic framework for dual character concepts and their expressions, offering an alternative to the received lexical‐semantic view. On the prevalent lexical‐semantic view, expressions such as “philosopher” or “scientist” are construed as lexical polysemes, comprising both a descriptive and a normative dimension. Thereby, this view prioritizes established norms, neglecting normative expressions emerging in specific contexts. In contrast, the pragmatic view integrates pragmatic modulation as a central element in explaining context‐dependent dual character concepts and expressions. This not only accounts for a wider range of phenomena but also addresses several theoretical shortcomings of the lexical view.","['Character (mathematics)', 'Dual (grammatical number)', 'Epistemology', 'Computer science', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'Geometry']",https://openalex.org/W4393407475,True,2,10.1111/mila.12505,character mathematics dual grammatical number epistemology computer science psychology linguistics philosophy mathematics geometry pragmatic view dual character concepts expressions article introduces new pragmatic framework dual character concepts expressions offering alternative received lexicalsemantic view prevalent lexicalsemantic view expressions philosopher scientist construed lexical polysemes comprising descriptive normative dimension view prioritizes established norms neglecting normative expressions emerging specific contexts contrast pragmatic view integrates pragmatic modulation central element explaining contextdependent dual character concepts expressions accounts wider range phenomena addresses theoretical shortcomings lexical view,1
A Comparative Study of Pejoration in English and Egyptian Vernacular Arabic from a Historical-Sociolinguistic Approach,2022,10.1155/2022/6813219,Education Research International,Sayed M. Ismail; Lafai bin Lafi Alsulami; Tahereh Heydarnejad,"Pejoration is an under-researched topic in the Arabic language. This study intends to examine pejoration in Egyptian Arabic, as well as its domains and causes. The study employs a socio-semantic approach for pursuing in-depth investigations of pejoration in Egyptian Arabic. Pejoration was contextually traced with the purpose of revealing how contextual realities, including historical, social, cultural, and even ethical norms, could contribute to the pejorative meaning of given linguistic expressions. The present used a mixed methodology combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. It has been discovered that pejoration in Egyptian Arabic has fallen into several domains such as morphological, prosodic, lexical, metaphorical, and pragmatic through conversational implicature and through slurs. The metaphorical extension of meaning has largely influenced the pejoration process in Egyptian Arabic, and it was found to be high in lexical items charged with sexual connotations. Nouns are more prone to pejoration than adjectives and verbs. Pejoration is largely represented in the vernacular discourse, which contributes to the notable gap between Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian colloquialism.","['Linguistics', 'Pejorative', 'Vernacular', 'Noun', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Arabic', 'Sociolinguistics', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Psychotherapist']",https://openalex.org/W4283075800,True,1,10.1155/2022/6813219,linguistics pejorative vernacular noun meaning existential arabic sociolinguistics sociology history psychology philosophy psychotherapist comparative study pejoration english egyptian vernacular arabic historical sociolinguistic approach pejoration researched topic arabic language study intends examine pejoration egyptian arabic domains causes study employs socio semantic approach pursuing depth investigations pejoration egyptian arabic pejoration contextually traced purpose revealing contextual realities including historical social cultural ethical norms contribute pejorative meaning given linguistic expressions present used mixed methodology combining qualitative quantitative approaches discovered pejoration egyptian arabic fallen domains morphological prosodic lexical metaphorical pragmatic conversational implicature slurs metaphorical extension meaning largely influenced pejoration process egyptian arabic high lexical items charged sexual connotations nouns prone pejoration adjectives verbs pejoration largely represented vernacular discourse contributes notable gap modern standard arabic egyptian colloquialism,1
Survival and loss of Old English religious vocabulary between 1150 and 1350,2018,10.1017/s1360674318000114,English Language and Linguistics,Olga Timofeeva,"Middle English religious vocabulary is radically different from that of the previous period: while Old English is characterised more by lexical pattern replication of Latin (and Greek) etyma, Middle English is the period of matter replication. Due to the intake of new French religious words, English lexemes and also whole word families undergo semantic transformation and lexical replacement. Other terms, however, survive from the Old English period into the present day, resisting contact-induced pressure. This study shows that the survival of old lexemes into Middle English is largely determined by the extent of their diffusion and frequency of occurrence before the Norman Conquest. It is postulated that two kinds of inherited Old English lexis should be distinguished in the Middle English period: (i) established terms that had belonged to the West Saxon standard and were still preserved in general use by the lower regular clergy, parish priests and the faithful at large, and (ii) terms of limited currency that had failed to spread outside local communities with strong ties and survived for a short time after the Conquest in smaller religious foundations. The innovation and spread of new francophone religious lexis was conditioned by the new preaching practices that began to develop in Europe in the wake of the Fourth Lateran Council and the emergence of mendicant orders. Preachers of the new type were the multilingual innovators who generated new lexis in English and at the same time were instrumental in its diffusion, serving as weak ties between the various levels of the medieval society. Urban middle classes, on the other hand, were the most likely English-speaking early adopters of new norms.","['Lexis', 'Old English', 'Middle English', 'Period (music)', 'History', 'Linguistics', 'Vocabulary', 'CONQUEST', 'Literature', 'Multilingualism', 'Sociology', 'Classics', 'Art', 'Ancient history', 'Philosophy', 'Aesthetics']",https://openalex.org/W2822566429,True,5,10.1017/s1360674318000114,lexis old english middle english period music history linguistics vocabulary conquest literature multilingualism sociology classics art ancient history philosophy aesthetics survival loss old english religious vocabulary middle english religious vocabulary radically different previous period old english characterised lexical pattern replication latin greek etyma middle english period matter replication intake new french religious words english lexemes word families undergo semantic transformation lexical replacement terms survive old english period present day resisting contact induced pressure study shows survival old lexemes middle english largely determined extent diffusion frequency occurrence norman conquest postulated kinds inherited old english lexis distinguished middle english period established terms belonged west saxon standard preserved general use lower regular clergy parish priests faithful large ii terms limited currency failed spread outside local communities strong ties survived short time conquest smaller religious foundations innovation spread new francophone religious lexis conditioned new preaching practices began develop europe wake fourth lateran council emergence mendicant orders preachers new type multilingual innovators generated new lexis english time instrumental diffusion serving weak ties various levels medieval society urban middle classes hand likely english speaking early adopters new norms,1
Italian age of acquisition norms for a large set of words (ItAoA),2018,10.31234/osf.io/br54j,,Maria Montefinese; David Vinson; Gabriella Vigliocco; Ettore Ambrosini,"Age of acquisition (AoA) is an important psycholinguistic variable that affects the performance of healthy individuals and patients in a large variety of cognitive tasks. For this reason, it becomes more and more compelling to collect new AoA norms for a large set of stimuli in order to allow better control and manipulation of AoA in future research. An important motivation of the present study is to extend previous Italian norms by collecting AoA ratings for a much larger range of Italian words for which concreteness and semantic-affective norms are now available thus ensuring greater coverage of words varying along these dimensions. In the present study, we collected AoA ratings for 1,957 Italian content words (adjectives, nouns and verbs), by asking healthy adult participants to estimate the age at which they thought they had learnt the word in a Web survey procedure. First, we found high split-half correlation within our sample, suggesting strong internal reliability. Second, our data indicate that the ratings collected in this study are as valid and reliable as those collected in previous studies for Italian across different age populations (adult and children) and other languages.

"Contextualized Sensorimotor Norms: multi-dimensional measures of sensorimotor strength for ambiguous English words, in context",2022,10.48550/arxiv.2203.05648,arXiv (Cornell University),Sean Trott; Benjamin Bergen,"Most large language models are trained on linguistic input alone, yet humans appear to ground their understanding of words in sensorimotor experience. A natural solution is to augment LM representations with human judgments of a word's sensorimotor associations (e.g., the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms), but this raises another challenge: most words are ambiguous, and judgments of words in isolation fail to account for this multiplicity of meaning (e.g., ""wooden table"" vs. ""data table""). We attempted to address this problem by building a new lexical resource of contextualized sensorimotor judgments for 112 English words, each rated in four different contexts (448 sentences total). We show that these ratings encode overlapping but distinct information from the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms, and that they also predict other measures of interest (e.g., relatedness), above and beyond measures derived from BERT. Beyond shedding light on theoretical questions, we suggest that these ratings could be of use as a ""challenge set"" for researchers building grounded language models.","['Psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Isolation (microbiology)', 'Linguistics', 'Context (archaeology)', 'Computer science', 'Paleontology', 'Philosophy', 'Microbiology', 'Psychotherapist', 'Biology', 'Programming language']",https://openalex.org/W4226178651,True,1,10.48550/arxiv.2203.05648,psychology cognitive psychology meaning existential set abstract data type isolation microbiology linguistics context archaeology computer science paleontology philosophy microbiology psychotherapist biology programming language contextualized sensorimotor norms multi dimensional measures sensorimotor strength ambiguous english words context large language models trained linguistic input humans appear ground understanding words sensorimotor experience natural solution augment lm representations human judgments word sensorimotor associations e g lancaster sensorimotor norms raises challenge words ambiguous judgments words isolation fail account multiplicity meaning e g wooden table vs data table attempted address problem building new lexical resource contextualized sensorimotor judgments english words rated different contexts sentences total ratings encode overlapping distinct information lancaster sensorimotor norms predict measures e g relatedness measures derived bert shedding light theoretical questions suggest ratings use challenge set researchers building grounded language models,1

This section also points to some aspects of Klára Buzássyová’s research on lexis and word­formation that have enriched the functional­structuralist paradigm. The second section shows other theoretical and methodological frameworks, such as linguistic pragmatics, cognitive linguistics and corpus linguistics (all of them departing in some respect from the structuralism and, in other aspects, being complementary with it) that can enhance the structuralist basis of the model. The third section outlines an extended model of lexical meaning that represents a synthesis of all those theoretical frameworks and, at the same time, represents a reflection of three language constituents: 1. The social constituent is present in consideration of communicative functions of utterances, naming functions of lexical units, functional styles and registers, language norms, and situational contexts; 2. The psychological component takes the form of consideration of the prototype effect, the abolition of boundaries between linguistic meaning and other parts of cognition; 3. Thanks to the structural/systematic component, a description of paradigmatic and syntagmatic behaviour of words can be performed, and an inventory of formal­content units and categories (lexemes, lexies, word­forming and grammatical structures) can be provided. In our dictionary practice, the above­mentioned model is reflected in the methodological procedures as follows: 1. Systemization of repetitive (regular, standardized) phenomena; 2. Prototypicalization of meaning description; 3. Contextualization/encyclopedization of meaning description; 4. Pragmatization of meaning description; 5. Continualized presentation of language phenomena, i.e., introduction of numerous phenomena of transient and indeterminate nature and indicating the existence of a semantic­pragmatic and lexical­grammatical continuum; 6. “Discretization” of combinatorial continuum, i.e., identification and description of entrenched word combinations with naming functions.","['Linguistics', 'Lexis', 'Syntagmatic analysis', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Lexical item', 'Structuralism (philosophy of science)', 'Cognitive linguistics', 'Slovak', 'Section (typography)', 'Structural linguistics', 'Pragmatics', 'Psychology', 'Computer science', 'Cognition', 'Applied linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Epistemology', 'Contrastive linguistics', 'Czech', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychotherapist', 'Operating system']",https://openalex.org/W2922352180,False,1,10.2478/jazcas-2019-0011,linguistics lexis syntagmatic analysis meaning existential lexical item structuralism philosophy science cognitive linguistics slovak section typography structural linguistics pragmatics psychology computer science cognition applied linguistics philosophy epistemology contrastive linguistics czech neuroscience psychotherapist operating pohlad pomenovanie cez prizmu teoretickych ramcov slovnikoveho hesla abstract paper outlines relevant aspects functional structuralism serving lexicographers departure point building model lexical meaning useable dictionary contemporary slovak language section points aspects klara buzassyovas research lexis wordformation enriched functionalstructuralist paradigm second section shows theoretical methodological frameworks linguistic pragmatics cognitive linguistics corpus linguistics departing respect structuralism aspects complementary enhance structuralist basis model section outlines extended model lexical meaning represents synthesis theoretical frameworks time represents reflection language constituents social constituent present consideration communicative functions utterances naming functions lexical units functional styles registers language norms situational contexts psychological component takes form consideration prototype effect abolition boundaries linguistic meaning parts cognition thanks structural systematic component description paradigmatic syntagmatic behaviour words performed inventory formalcontent units categories lexemes lexies wordforming grammatical structures provided dictionary practice abovementioned model reflected methodological procedures follows systemization repetitive regular standardized phenomena prototypicalization meaning description contextualization encyclopedization meaning description pragmatization meaning description continualized presentation language phenomena e introduction numerous phenomena transient indeterminate nature indicating existence semanticpragmatic lexicalgrammatical continuum discretization combinatorial continuum e identification description entrenched word combinations naming functions,1
Dialectally-sensitive norms of the Spanish version of Main Concept Analysis (Span-MCA) for quantifying neurogenically impaired spoken discourse,2021,10.5209/rlog.69932,Revista de Investigación en Logopedia,Anthony Pak‐Hin Kong,"Aphasia is an acquired language impairment caused by damage in the regions of the brain that support language. The Main Concept Analysis (MCA; Kong, 2016b) is a published formal assessment battery that allows the quantification of the presence, accuracy, completeness, and efficiency of content in spoken discourse produced by persons with aphasia (PWA). It utilizes a sequential picture description task (with four sets of pictures) for language sample elicitation. The MCA results can also be used clinically for targeting appropriate interventions of aphasic output. The purpose of this research is to develop a Spanish adaptation of the MCA (i.e., Span-MCA) by establishing normative data based on native unimpaired speakers of Spanish from four different dialect origins (Central American Caribbean, Andean-Pacific, Mexican, and Central-Southern Peninsular regions). A total of 91 unimpaired participants that consisted of different age groups, education levels, and dialect origins were recruited to establish four sets of dialect-specific norms and scoring criteria of Span-MCA, including target main concepts and corresponding lexical items related to the picture sets. The Span-MCA was also applied to one pilot native Spanish PWA. The normative data suggested that speakers who were younger or with a higher level of education levels produced significantly more accurate and complete main concepts in their spoken discourse. The application of Span-MCA to the pilot native Spanish PWA successfully identified impaired performance, as compared to the dialectally-sensitive norms established in this study. This study highlighted the clinical value of Span-MCA as a supplement to evaluate spoken discourse and target intervention by speech-language pathologists and related healthcare practitioners.","['Normative', 'Aphasia', 'Psychology', 'Life span', 'Spoken language', 'Linguistics', 'Span (engineering)', 'First language', 'Computer science', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Natural language processing', 'Medicine', 'Gerontology', 'Philosophy', 'Civil engineering', 'Epistemology', 'Engineering']",https://openalex.org/W3161203376,True,5,10.5209/rlog.69932,normative aphasia psychology life span spoken language linguistics span engineering language computer science cognitive psychology natural language processing medicine gerontology philosophy civil engineering epistemology engineering dialectally sensitive norms spanish version main concept analysis span mca quantifying neurogenically impaired spoken discourse aphasia acquired language impairment caused damage regions brain support language main concept analysis mca kong b published formal assessment battery allows quantification presence accuracy completeness efficiency content spoken discourse produced persons aphasia pwa utilizes sequential picture description task sets pictures language sample elicitation mca results used clinically targeting appropriate interventions aphasic output purpose research develop spanish adaptation mca e span mca establishing normative data based native unimpaired speakers spanish different dialect origins central american caribbean andean pacific mexican central southern peninsular regions total unimpaired participants consisted different age groups education levels dialect origins recruited establish sets dialect specific norms scoring criteria span mca including target main concepts corresponding lexical items related picture sets span mca applied pilot native spanish pwa normative data suggested speakers younger higher level education levels produced significantly accurate complete main concepts spoken discourse application span mca pilot native spanish pwa successfully identified impaired performance compared dialectally sensitive norms established study study highlighted clinical value span mca supplement evaluate spoken discourse target intervention speech language pathologists related healthcare practitioners,1
How well do similarity measures predict priming in abstract and concrete concepts?,2018,10.31234/osf.io/ypvgw,,Maria Montefinese; Erin Michelle Buchanan; David Vinson,"Models of semantic representation predict that automatic priming is determined by associative and co-occurrence relations (i.e., spreading activation accounts), or to similarity in words' semantic features (i.e., featural models). Although, these three factors are correlated in characterizing semantic representation, they seem to tap different aspects of meaning. We designed two lexical decision experiments to dissociate these three different types of meaning similarity. For unmasked primes, we observed priming only due to association strength and not the other two measures; and no evidence for differences in priming for concrete and abstract concepts. For masked primes there was no priming regardless of the semantic relation. These results challenge theoretical accounts of automatic priming. Rather, they are in line with the idea that priming may be due to participants’ controlled strategic processes. These results provide important insight about the nature of priming and how association strength, as determined from word-association norms, relates to the nature of semantic representation.","['Priming (agriculture)', 'Associative property', 'Semantic relation', 'Similarity (geometry)', 'Lexical decision task', 'Representation (politics)', 'Association (psychology)', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Semantic similarity', 'Psychology', 'Word Association', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Semantic memory', 'Relation (database)', 'Natural language processing', 'Linguistics', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Cognition', 'Mathematics', 'Neuroscience', 'Botany', 'Germination', 'Politics', 'Political science', 'Pure mathematics', 'Law', 'Image (mathematics)', 'Psychotherapist', 'Biology', 'Philosophy', 'Database']",https://openalex.org/W4249927222,True,4,10.31234/osf.io/ypvgw,priming agriculture associative property semantic relation similarity geometry lexical decision task representation politics association psychology meaning existential semantic similarity psychology word association cognitive psychology semantic memory relation database natural language processing linguistics computer science artificial intelligence cognition mathematics neuroscience botany germination politics political science pure mathematics law image mathematics psychotherapist biology philosophy database similarity measures predict priming abstract concrete concepts models semantic representation predict automatic priming determined associative occurrence relations e spreading activation accounts similarity words semantic features e featural models factors correlated characterizing semantic representation tap different aspects meaning designed lexical decision experiments dissociate different types meaning similarity unmasked primes observed priming association strength measures evidence differences priming concrete abstract concepts masked primes priming regardless semantic relation results challenge theoretical accounts automatic priming line idea priming participants controlled strategic processes results provide important insight nature priming association strength determined word association norms relates nature semantic representation,1

Dutch modality exclusivity norms for 336 properties and 411 concepts,2020,10.31234/osf.io/s2c5h,,Pablo Bernabeu,"This study is a cross-linguistic, conceptual replication of Lynott and Connell’s (2009, 2013) modality exclusivity norms. Their English properties and concepts were translated into Dutch, then independently tested as follows. Forty-two respondents rated the auditory, haptic, and visual strength of those words. Mean scores were then computed, with a high interrater reliability and interitem consistency. Based on the three modalities, each word also features a specific modality exclusivity, and a dominant modality. The norms also include external measures of word frequency, length, distinctiveness, age of acquisition, and known percentage. Starting with the results, unimodal, bimodal, and tri-modal words appear. Visual and haptic experience are quite related, leaving a more independent auditory experience. These different relations are important because they may correlate with different levels of detail in word comprehension (Louwerse &amp;amp; Connell, 2011). Auditory and visual words tend toward unimodality, whereas haptic words tend toward multimodality. Likewise, properties are more unimodal than concepts. Last, the 'sound symbolism' hypothesis was tested by means of a regression: Auditory strength predicts lexical properties of the words (e.g., frequency, distinctiveness) better than the other modalities do, or else with a different polarity.

Getting a Grip on Sensorimotor Effects in Lexical-Semantic Processing,2018,10.31234/osf.io/z5njg,,Alison Heard; Christopher R. Madan; Andrea B. Protzner; Penny M. Pexman,"One of the strategies that researchers have used to investigate the role of sensorimotor information in lexical-semantic processing is to examine effects of words’ rated body-object interaction (BOI; the ease with which the human body can interact with a word’s referent). Processing tends to be facilitated for words with high BOI compared to words with low BOI, across a wide variety of tasks. Such effects have been referenced in debates over the nature of semantic representations, but their theoretical import has been limited by the fact that BOI is a fairly coarse measure of sensorimotor experience with words’ referents. In the present study we collected ratings for 621 words on seven semantic dimensions (graspability, ease of pantomime, number of actions, animacy, size, danger, and usefulness) in order to investigate which attributes are most strongly related to BOI ratings, and to lexical-semantic processing. BOI ratings were obtained from previous norming studies (Bennett, Burnett, Siakaluk, &amp;amp; Pexman, 2011; Tillotson, Siakaluk, &amp;amp; Pexman, 2008) and measures of lexical-semantic processing were obtained from previous behavioural megastudies involving the semantic categorization task (concrete/abstract decision; Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, &amp;amp; Yap, 2017) and the lexical decision task (Balota et al., 2007). Results showed that the motor dimension of graspability, ease of pantomime, and number of actions were all related to BOI and that these dimensions together explained more variance in semantic processing than did BOI ratings alone. These ratings will be useful for researchers who wish to study how different kinds of bodily interactions influence lexical-semantic processing and cognition.","['Categorization', 'Semantic memory', 'Psychology', 'Lexical decision task', 'Dimension (graph theory)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Task (project management)', 'Cognition', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Mathematics', 'Management', 'Neuroscience', 'Pure mathematics', 'Economics']",https://openalex.org/W4254008268,True,2,10.31234/osf.io/z5njg,categorization semantic memory psychology lexical decision task dimension graph theory cognitive psychology task project management cognition computer science artificial intelligence mathematics management neuroscience pure mathematics economics getting grip sensorimotor effects lexical semantic processing strategies researchers used investigate role sensorimotor information lexical semantic processing examine effects words rated body object interaction boi ease human body interact words referent processing tends facilitated words high boi compared words low boi wide variety tasks effects referenced debates nature semantic representations theoretical import limited fact boi fairly coarse measure sensorimotor experience words referents present study collected ratings words seven semantic dimensions graspability ease pantomime number actions animacy size danger usefulness order investigate attributes strongly related boi ratings lexical semantic processing boi ratings obtained previous norming studies bennett burnett siakaluk amp amp pexman tillotson siakaluk amp amp pexman measures lexical semantic processing obtained previous behavioural megastudies involving semantic categorization task concrete abstract decision pexman heard lloyd amp amp yap lexical decision task balota et al results showed motor dimension graspability ease pantomime number actions related boi dimensions explained variance semantic processing did boi ratings ratings useful researchers wish study different kinds bodily interactions influence lexical semantic processing cognition,1

JALEX: Japanese version of lexical decision database,2025,10.3389/flang.2024.1506509,Frontiers in Language Sciences,Naoto Ota; Masaya Mochizuki,"Several lexical databases have been developed in both English-speaking countries and other countries, leading to numerous studies using these resources. A prominent example is the English Lexicon Project (ELP; Balota et al., 2007), a large-scale database containing behavioral data on English word processing. The ELP provides data for two main tasks: the lexical decision task (LDT) and the speeded naming task. Among these, the LDT is the most commonly utilized in word-processing research, largely because 1) it is easy to implement, and 2) it can be conducted online with relative ease (Lieber et al., 2014).In the LDT, participants are asked to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether a visually presented string of letters forms a real word or a non-word. By analyzing the response time from when the string is presented until the participant makes a decision, researchers can evaluate the speed of word access and semantic processing. The LDT has been employed not only to assess word processing efficiency and cognitive load but also to investigate the structure of the mental lexicon and concept representation. For example, researchers have examined the relationship between LDT response times and various word properties, including the frequency effect, where more frequent words are processed faster and reexamined using the LDT data (Brysbaert et al., 2011).Numerous psycholinguistic studies have explored the semantic properties of word recognition using LDT data. Recently, LDT databases have expanded beyond English, with resources available in languages such as Chinese (Tse et al., 2017), French (Ferrand et al., 2017), and Spanish (Aguasvivas et al., 2018), allowing for more efficient research across languages. For example, researchers have tested hypotheses involving grounded cognition and embodied cognition (Barsalou, 2008) in word recognition and explored the relationship between word recognition and sensorimotor information across various languages, e.g., English (Pexman et al., 2019; Sidhu et al., 2014), French (Lalancette et al., 2024), and Spanish (Alonso et al., 2018). They further examined theoretical predictions with large-scale survey data, often using lexical decision task (LDT) reaction times as the dependent variable in regression analyses. While earlier findings have supported these theories by showing consistent trends across languages, recent discussions have highlighted cross-linguistic variability in these effects (Alonso et al., 2018; Lalancette et al., 2024). Such hypothesis testing using a database reduces stimulus bias by incorporating many words (see Dymarska et al., 2023) and enables new discoveries through cross-linguistic comparisons.In Japanese, several databases are available, as will be discussed later. For example, databases exist for attributes such as word imageability (Sakuma et al., 2005) and familiarity (Asahara, 2020), each containing evaluative data for tens of thousands of words. These databases have long been used in various ways, such as serving as control variables in numerous Japanese word recognition studies (e.g., Mizuno and Matsui, 2018; Mochizuki and Ota, 2020, 2024). However, no LDT database currently exists for Japanese, posing a challenge to psycholinguistic research on the Japanese language as a result of limited resources. Of course, lexical decision tasks have been widely used in Japanese word recognition studies (e.g., Kawakami, 2002; Kusunose et al., 2013). However, the number of stimulus words used in these studies is significantly smaller compared to databases such as the ELP (Balota et al., 2007). Furthermore, the data are not always publicly available, which limits their utility as resources. Given the increasing emphasis on cross-linguistic validation—particularly in studies of abstract concepts shaped by language and culture (Dove, 2018)—developing a large-scale Japanese LDT database would not only aid Japanese researchers but also contribute to the broader field. Therefore, this study aimed to construct a Japanese version of LDT database.It is important to note that individual differences in LDT response times exist (e.g., Hawker and Ferraro, 2007; Yates and Slattery, 2019; Lim et al., 2020). To enhance the database, we collected data on participants' individual characteristics following the LDT. Specifically, participants completed the ENDCOREs, which measures interpersonal communication skills (Fujimoto and Daibo, 2007), and the Japanese version of the Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (Psi-Q) (Fukui and Aoki, 2022). The ENDCOREs assesses six dimensions of communication: self-control, expressiveness, comprehension, assertiveness, acceptance of others, and relational adjustment. The Psi-Q evaluates the vividness of mental imagery across sensory modalities (i.e., vision, sound, smell, taste, touch, body, and emotion), capturing individual differences in multisensory imagery.Although we do not hypothesize a direct relationship between these individual difference variables and simple LDT response times (e.g., the higher/lower a score, the slower/faster the response time), they may serve as possible predictors for validating certain content. For instance, the grounded or embodied cognition framework (Barsalou, 2020, 2008) posits that processing words or concepts involves simulating the sensory modalities through which they are acquired. Consistent with this, processing words rich in sensorimotor information tends to be more efficient (Lynott et al., 2020; Siakaluk et al., 2008; Sidhu et al., 2014; Sidhu and Pexman, 2016; Tillotson et al., 2008). Individual differences in sensitivity to sensory and motor modalities may interact with word characteristics and influence LDT performance. Furthermore, the ""Words as Social Tools"" (WAT) perspective (Borghi and Binkofski, 2014) posits that simulating social and linguistic information is crucial for understanding abstract concepts (Borghi et al., 2019). Therefore, words with a stronger social nature may be processed more efficiently (Diveica et al., 2023), and the interaction between verbal sociality and individual sociality may affect LDT response times. Since ENDCOREs reflect an individual's communication skills, individuals with high social interaction skills may find it easier to simulate socially relevant words. Consequently, they might be more efficient in processing abstract words with strong social characteristics. While the present study did not specifically examine the relationship between individual differences and LDT response times, future research could benefit from incorporating these variables into the database.This report introduces the Japanese LDT database (JALEX), which incorporates individual differences among participants. The response time and accuracy data can be used for future psycholinguistic studies involving Japanese participants. Additionally, while no hypotheses were tested, future research may explore the role of individual differences as needed.In the development of psycholinguistic norms, approximately 30 to 40 observations per word are typically required (Balota et al., 2007; Ferrand et al., 2017). However, we recruited a relatively large number of participants to account for potential dropouts, as this was an online study, and to develop more reliable norms.Participants were recruited through a crowdsourcing service Yahoo! Crowdsourcing (https://crowdsourcing.yahoo.co.jp/). A total of 2,689 individuals accessed the task. However, 1,037 either did not start, failed to complete the task, or provided no responses. Ultimately, 1,652 participants completed the task. All participants self-reported as native Japanese speakers. Among them, 1,226 were men, 407 were women, two identified as other genders, and 17 chose not to respond. The mean age was 51.07 years (SD = 11.91), with a range from 18 to 85 years. The participants' highest levels of education were as follows: 26 had completed doctoral programs, 119 had master's degrees, 1,069 were college graduates, 21 had finished high school, 28 had completed junior high school, and 26 chose not to respond. As detailed below, the words were divided into 38 lists. With 1,652 participants, this resulted in approximately 43 participants per list. To develop JALEX databases, we selected words with semantic properties listed in multiple extant databases (DBs). This approach ensured consistency with previous word recognition studies and supported continuity in future research. We followed a specific selection procedure. First, we used the Word List by Semantic Principles, revised and enlarged edition (WLSP, National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics, 2004) as the master list. From this, we selected words that appeared in all eight of the following DBs: the word familiarity DB (Asahara, 2020), an alternate word familiarity DB (Fujita and Kobayashi, 2020), the word frequency DB (Amano and Kondo, 2000), the NINJAL-LWP for TWC word frequency DB (University of Tsukuba et al., 2013), the word difficulty DB (Kajiwara et al., 2020), the imageability DB for visual words (Sakuma et al., 2005), the semantic orientations DB (Takamura et al., 2005), and the abstractness DB for Japanese words (The Social Computing Laboratory, 2021). Following this procedure, we selected 5,736 Japanese words as stimuli. These included 4,977 nouns, 648 verbs, and 111 adjectives.For each word, linguistic characteristics such as orthographic neighborhood size (ONS), phonological neighborhood size (PNS), orthographic Levenshtein distance 20 (OLD20, Yarkoni et al., 2008), the number of letters, and the number of morae (a rhythmic unit of sound) were calculated. The PNS was computed by decomposing the 'phonetic' (読み) variable in the WLSP (National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics, 2004) by mora and calculating how many words in the WLSP had one mora replaced. Similarly, the ONS was calculated by decomposing the 'letter (見出し本体)' variable in the WLSP into individual characters and determining how many words had one letter replaced. OLD20 was calculated using the old20 function in the vwr package (Keuleers, 2013) in R (R Core Team, 2022), based on the 'letter (見出し本体)' variable in the WLSP.In addition, non-words were constructed as filler items for the LDT. First, from the WLSP, we excluded words with one mora, words containing spaces, symbols, or particles, homophones, and items with repetitive morae (e.g., ha-ha-ha [ha/ha/ha]), as these could not be transformed into non-words using the procedure described below. The remaining items were then decomposed into morae, and each mora was randomly shuffled. If the resulting item was not found in the WLSP, it was considered a non-word candidate. This process yielded 63,305 non-word candidates, from which we randomly selected 5,736 to serve as fillers for the LDT. The authors reviewed these candidates, and those deemed too similar to real words were replaced with different non-word candidates. All non-word stimuli are available for reference on Open Science Framework (OSF).The words and non-words were randomly divided into 38 lists, each containing 150 or 151 words (150 × 2 + 151 × 36 = 5,736) with an equal number of non-words.The LDT task was conducted online, and participants accessed the LDT program via their own PCs. The program was created using PsychoPy (Peirce et al., 2019) and hosted on Pavlovia (https://pavlovia.org/). After obtaining informed consent from the participants, they were instructed to begin the task. In the LDT, a blank screen appeared for 200 ms, followed by a fixation point in the center of the screen for 300 ms. A string of characters was then presented, and participants had to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether the string represented a real Japanese word. The string remained on the screen until a response was made or for up to 2,000 ms. Participants pressed the 'L' key for words and the 'S' key for non-words. If the response was correct, the task proceeded to the next trial; if incorrect, a feedback message (""Wrong"") appeared in red. If no response was given within 2,000 ms, the feedback message (""Too late"") was displayed in red for 300 ms. Words and non-words were presented in random order. Participants completed 20 practice trials before starting the actual task. The practice trials used different stimuli from those in the actual task.During the task, participants were allowed to take a break for a maximum of 60 seconds between the 100th and 200th trials. During the break, their percentage of correct answers was displayed to encourage them to continue. Upon completing the LDT, participants answered the ENDCOREs (Fujimoto and Daibo, 2007) and Psi-Q (Fukui and Aoki, 2022) questionnaires. Additionally, they provided demographic information, including gender, age, dominant hand, highest level of education, and native language. Data were collected on May 20 and May 21, 2024. We calculated the accuracy rate for each participant, and the lowest percentage of correct responses exceeded 75%. Since no participants demonstrated an exceptionally low accuracy rate, data from all participants were retained for analysis.The procedure for processing the response time data followed that employed in ELP (Balota et al., 2007). First, we extracted only correct trials, where the ""L"" key was pressed for word stimuli, and excluded any trials with response times below 200 ms. Second, we removed trials that deviated by ±3 SD from the participant's mean response time. This resulted in the exclusion of 1.96% of trials as outliers.The distribution of response times averaged by item is showed in Figure 1. We presented the partial correlations with existing DB variables referenced in stimulus selection to examine the convergent validity of the response time data (Figure 2). These findings confirmed the phenomena predicted in prior studies. Specifically, we confirmed the frequency effect (Rubenstein et al., 1971) and familiarity effect (Connine et al., 1990), where lexical decision times decrease as word frequency and familiarity increase. We also observed the imageability effect (Balota et al., 2004), where higher imageability leads to faster lexical decisions, and the orthographic similarity effect (Yarkoni et al., 2008), where greater Levenshtein distance results in longer response times. While few studies have reported simple or partial correlations with these variables in Japanese, several experimental studies using Japanese words as stimuli have observed effects similar to those identified in the present study. For instance, Japanese word recognition research has reported faster word processing for words with higher imageability (Ogawa and Nittono, 2018) and higher frequency (Mizuno and Matsui, 2015). The relationship between response time and Kajiwara's (2020) difficulty rating has yet to be investigated. However, it is reasonable to predict that more difficult words would require longer processing times for comprehension. The current analysis identified a slight positive correlation between word difficulty and response time. These findings suggest that JALEX is valid to a considerable extent.The partial correlations between familiarity, semantic orientation, abstractness, and response time were significant, but the effects were small. Of these, the zero-order correlation for familiarity was r = -.42, suggesting that higher familiarity facilitates responses when not adjusted for covariates. Zero-order correlations for abstractness revealed a small effect (r =.11), indicating that processing was slightly suppressed for more abstract words, consistent with the representativeness effect (Cortese and Balota, 2012). This study also found that words with high ONS had shorter lexical decision times. The results showed that high ONS words took less time to judge than low ONS words when using Kanji words (Mizuno and Matsui, 2014), which is consistent with the current results. However, when using Katakana words, the inhibitory effect was observed, indicating that low ONS words took less time to judge than high ONS words (Kawakami, 2002). Furthermore, an interaction between ONS and PNS has also been observed in lexical decision performance for katakana words (Hino et al., 2011). The difference in these results may be caused by the limited number of words used in the experiment and the factors of the orthographic form. In studies using word norms, it is particularly important to consider the extent of word coverage and the absence of bias (Dymarska et al., 2023). The failure to replicate the effects observed in previous studies in the present analysis of a relatively large database may be attributed to biases in the stimulus sets used in those studies, which could have significantly influenced their results. Future research should assess the reproducibility of findings from previous studies by leveraging large databases, such as JALEX, and conducting comprehensive analyses.In the present study, the imageability effect (Balota et al., 2004) was replicated even after controlling for linguistic statistical variables, such as the frequency of neighboring words. The effects of psycholinguistic variables, such as the imageability effect, are often discussed in relation to semantic richness (Pexman et al., 2013). Semantic richness refers to the idea that words associated with more semantic information have richer semantic representations, enabling them to be processed more quickly and accurately. In other words, our study replicates in Japanese the finding that the ease of forming a mental image is an important semantic variable in word representations. As discussed in the introduction, the relationship between sensorimotor information and word recognition is explained by the concept of semantic richness—specifically, the richness of the semantic dimension of sensorimotor information facilitates word recognition. In future studies, it will be important to investigate the nature of concept representations by examining psycholinguistic variables influencing word recognition beyond imageability.Furthermore, this study is the first DB of LDT to include individual difference variables for respondents, paving the way for future research on individual differences using JALEX. In word recognition research, it has been observed that certain words exhibit significant individual differences and high variability in ratings of psychological variables (Paisios et al., 2023). A key limitation of the previous DB of LDT is that they did not provide individual difference data for participants, making them unsuitable for studying individual differences in words with high variability in ratings among individuals. Future research using JALEX is expected to refine further grounded cognition theory (Barsalou, 2020, 2008) and advance WAT theory (Borghi and Binkofski, 2014), particularly by promoting individual difference studies on the simulation of sensorimotor information and those related to social communication.This database represents the most comprehensive dataset on the efficiency of Japanese visual word processing and stands as a powerful resource for future research in psychology and linguistics. A unique feature of this database is its inclusion of individual difference variables for participants, allowing researchers to analyze these differences in future studies.However, it is important to note that some words in the dataset had lower accuracy rates. For example, at least 15 items had a correct response rate below 70%, with fewer than 20 observations. Items with fewer observations may exhibit lower reliability and reproducibility compared to others. While we did not exclude these items in the current analysis, researchers should be mindful of their presence when using the database.All data reported in this study can be found in the OSF Repository (https://osf.io/qr2sg). Information from existing databases used for validation cannot be included in the data resources of this study as a result of copyright, however, such information is available in the

"From vector spaces to DRM lists: False Memory Generator, a software for automated generation of lists of stimuli inducing false memories",2024,10.3758/s13428-024-02425-0,Behavior Research Methods,Marco A. Petilli; Marco Marelli; Giuliana Mazzoni; Michela Marchetti; Luca Rinaldi; Daniele Gatti,"Abstract The formation of false memories is one of the most widely studied topics in cognitive psychology. The Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm is a powerful tool for investigating false memories and revealing the cognitive mechanisms subserving their formation. In this task, participants first memorize a list of words (encoding phase) and next have to indicate whether words presented in a new list were part of the initially memorized one (recognition phase). By employing DRM lists optimized to investigate semantic effects, previous studies highlighted a crucial role of semantic processes in false memory generation, showing that new words semantically related to the studied ones tend to be more erroneously recognized (compared to new words less semantically related). Despite the strengths of the DRM task, this paradigm faces a major limitation in list construction due to its reliance on human-based association norms, posing both practical and theoretical concerns. To address these issues, we developed the False Memory Generator (FMG), an automated and data-driven tool for generating DRM lists, which exploits similarity relationships between items populating a vector space. Here, we present FMG and demonstrate the validity of the lists generated in successfully replicating well-known semantic effects on false memory production. FMG potentially has broad applications by allowing for testing false memory production in domains that go well beyond the current possibilities, as it can be in principle applied to any vector space encoding properties related to word referents (e.g., lexical, orthographic, phonological, sensory, affective, etc.) or other type of stimuli (e.g., images, sounds, etc.).","['Computer science', 'False memory', 'Task (project management)', 'Natural language processing', 'Memorization', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Word (group theory)', 'Encoding (memory)', 'Cognition', 'Generator (circuit theory)', 'Semantic memory', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Recall', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Philosophy', 'Power (physics)', 'Physics', 'Management', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience', 'Economics']",https://openalex.org/W4396668934,True,5,10.3758/s13428-024-02425-0,computer science false memory task project management natural language processing memorization artificial intelligence word group theory encoding memory cognition generator circuit theory semantic memory cognitive psychology recall psychology linguistics philosophy power physics physics management quantum mechanics neuroscience economics vector spaces drm lists false memory generator software automated generation lists stimuli inducing false memories abstract formation false memories widely studied topics cognitive psychology deeseroedigermcdermott drm paradigm powerful tool investigating false memories revealing cognitive mechanisms subserving formation task participants memorize list words encoding phase indicate words presented new list initially memorized recognition phase employing drm lists optimized investigate semantic effects previous studies highlighted crucial role semantic processes false memory generation showing new words semantically related studied ones tend erroneously recognized compared new words semantically related despite strengths drm task paradigm faces major limitation list construction reliance human based association norms posing practical theoretical concerns address issues developed false memory generator fmg automated data driven tool generating drm lists exploits similarity relationships items populating vector space present fmg demonstrate validity lists generated successfully replicating known semantic effects false memory production fmg potentially broad applications allowing testing false memory production domains current possibilities principle applied vector space encoding properties related word referents e g lexical orthographic phonological sensory affective type stimuli e g images sounds,1

Figurative Archive: an open dataset and web-based application for the study of metaphor,2025,10.31234/osf.io/38kju_v1,,Maddalena Bressler; Veronica Mangiaterra; Paolo Canal; Federico Frau; Fabrizio Luciani; Biagio Scalingi; Chiara Barattieri di San Pietro; Chiara Battaglini; Chiara Pompei; F. Romeo; Luca Bischetti; Valentina Bambini,"Research on metaphor has steadily increased over the last decades, as this phenomenon opens a window into a range of processes in language and cognition, from pragmatic inference to abstraction and embodied simulation. At the same time, the demand for rigorously constructed and extensively normed experimental materials increased as well. Here, we present the Figurative Archive, an open database of 997 metaphors in Italian enriched with rating and corpus-based measures (from familiarity to lexical frequency), derived by collecting stimuli used across 11 studies.

The Enduring Challenge of Literacy Issues in Adulthood: Investigating Spelling Deficits among Dyslexic Italian University Students,2024,10.3390/brainsci14070712,Brain Sciences,Francesca Vizzi; Marika Iaia; Maria Diletta Carlino; Chiara Valeria Marinelli; Marco Turi; Paola Angelelli,"The issue of literacy challenges among dyslexic adults remains a significant concern. This study investigates spelling deficits among highly educated adults with dyslexia learning a transparent orthography. Thirty-eight Italian dyslexic university students were examined and compared to a group of age- and education-matched typical readers. Firstly, we analyzed spelling performance using a Passage Dictation Test. Additionally, lists of words varying in length and word frequency were dictated under two experimental conditions: a normal condition (NC) and an articulatory suppression condition (ASC). The ASC assessed the participants’ ability to spell with interference to the phonological (sublexical) spelling procedure, i.e., the most likely compensated spelling strategy of Italian dyslexic spellers. The results clearly indicated that, in spelling the meaningful passage, dyslexic participants underperformed compared to the controls, with a prevalence of lexical errors, despite the comparison with the normative reference data showing only mild spelling difficulties. In spelling isolated words in normal conditions, dyslexic participants performed within the reference norms and as accurately as control participants across all stimuli (short words, high- and low-frequency words), except for long words, where their spelling difficulties were evident. Articulatory suppression significantly impaired dyslexics’ performance on short stimuli, reducing the usual sublexical advantage associated with them, and exacerbated misspellings on long words. Additionally, articulatory suppression disproportionately affected dyslexics’ performance on high-frequency words, diminishing the typical lexical advantage associated with these words. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical, clinical, and educational implications.","['Spelling', 'Dyslexia', 'Literacy', 'Psychology', 'Developmental psychology', 'Mathematics education', 'Linguistics', 'Reading (process)', 'Pedagogy', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4400640495,True,2,10.3390/brainsci14070712,spelling dyslexia literacy psychology developmental psychology mathematics education linguistics reading process pedagogy philosophy enduring challenge literacy issues adulthood investigating spelling deficits dyslexic italian university students issue literacy challenges dyslexic adults remains significant concern study investigates spelling deficits highly educated adults dyslexia learning transparent orthography thirty italian dyslexic university students examined compared group age education matched typical readers firstly analyzed spelling performance using passage dictation test additionally lists words varying length word frequency dictated experimental conditions normal condition nc articulatory suppression condition asc asc assessed participants ability spell interference phonological sublexical spelling procedure e likely compensated spelling strategy italian dyslexic spellers results clearly indicated spelling meaningful passage dyslexic participants underperformed compared controls prevalence lexical errors despite comparison normative reference data showing mild spelling difficulties spelling isolated words normal conditions dyslexic participants performed reference norms accurately control participants stimuli short words high low frequency words long words spelling difficulties evident articulatory suppression significantly impaired dyslexics performance short stimuli reducing usual sublexical advantage associated exacerbated misspellings long words additionally articulatory suppression disproportionately affected dyslexics performance high frequency words diminishing typical lexical advantage associated words results discussed terms theoretical clinical educational implications,1
Nymph Piss and Gravy Orgies: Local and Global Contrast Effects in Relational Humor,2021,10.31234/osf.io/3r7fw,,Cynthia S. Q. Siew; Tomas Engelthaler; Thomas T. Hills,"How does the relation between two words create humor? In this paper, we investigated the effect of global and local contrast on the humor of word pairs. We capitalized on the existence of psycholinguistic lexical norms by examining violations of expectations set up by typical patterns of English usage (global contrast) and within the local context of the words within the word pairs (local contrast). Global contrast was operationalized as lexical-semantic norms for single-words and local contrast was operationalized as the orthographic, phonological, and semantic distance between the two words in the pair. Through crowdsourced (Study 1) and best-worst (Study 2) ratings of the humor of a large set of word pairs (i.e., compounds), we find evidence of both global and local contrast on compound-word humor. Specifically, we find that humor arises when there is a violation of expectations at the local level, between the individual words that make up the word pair, even after accounting for violations at the global level relative to the entire language. Semantic variables (arousal, dominance, concreteness) were stronger predictors of word pair humor whereas form-related variables (number of letters, phonemes, letter frequency) were stronger predictors of single-word humor. Moreover, we also find that semantic dissimilarity increases humor, by defusing the impact of low-valence words—making them seem more amusing—and by enhancing the incongruence of highly imageable pairs of concrete words.","['Contrast (vision)', 'Concreteness', 'Psychology', 'Valence (chemistry)', 'Linguistics', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Operationalization', 'Word (group theory)', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Computer science', 'Cognition', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Epistemology', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience', 'Programming language']",https://openalex.org/W4205420407,True,1,10.31234/osf.io/3r7fw,contrast vision concreteness psychology valence chemistry linguistics set abstract data type operationalization word group theory psycholinguistics cognitive psychology computer science cognition artificial intelligence philosophy physics epistemology quantum mechanics neuroscience programming language nymph piss gravy orgies local global contrast effects relational humor does relation words create humor paper investigated effect global local contrast humor word pairs capitalized existence psycholinguistic lexical norms examining violations expectations set typical patterns english usage global contrast local context words word pairs local contrast global contrast operationalized lexical semantic norms single words local contrast operationalized orthographic phonological semantic distance words pair crowdsourced study best worst study ratings humor large set word pairs e compounds evidence global local contrast compound word humor specifically humor arises violation expectations local level individual words make word pair accounting violations global level relative entire language semantic variables arousal dominance concreteness stronger predictors word pair humor form related variables number letters phonemes letter frequency stronger predictors single word humor semantic dissimilarity increases humor defusing impact low valence wordsmaking amusingand enhancing incongruence highly imageable pairs concrete words,1

In this work, we address both issues by introducing a new English word association dataset. We describe the collection of word associations for over 12,000 cue words, currently the largest such English-language resource in the world. Our procedure allowed subjects to provide multiple responses for each cue, which permits us to measure weak associations. We evaluate the utility of the dataset in several different contexts, including lexical decision and semantic categorization. We also show that measures based on a mechanism of spreading activation derived from this new resource are highly predictive of direct judgments of similarity.

Reward as a Facet of Word Meaning: Ratings of Motivation for 8601 English Words,2025,10.31234/osf.io/h9m8u,,Doina-Irina Giurgea; Penny M. Pexman; Richard J. Binney,"Semantic representations arise from a distillation of multiple sources of information, including sensory, motor, affective, interoceptive, linguistic and cognitive experience. Experience of reward is a highly salient aspect of many human activities, and yet its contribution to semantic processing is not well understood. To address this, the present study took a psycholinguistic approach to measuring and evaluating associations with reward as a facet of word meaning. Behavioral and neurophysiological data suggest reward processing involves multiple stages and mechanisms. For instance, systems associated with the experience and anticipation of pleasure in response to a reward appear distinct from motivational processes that underlie pursuit of a stimulus. We sought to collect a novel set of word ratings that capture the full extent of reward-related experience. Initial explorations revealed that reward/pleasure ratings are highly correlated with existing norms of emotional valence. Ratings of association with motivation, however, were only moderately correlated with valence, suggesting they capture distinct semantic information. We therefore conducted a preregistered large-scale study to obtain motivation ratings for 8601 words. Our analyses suggest these ratings capture aspects of word meaning which are distinct from other semantic dimensions, such as concreteness and valence. Moreover, they explain unique variance in participant performance on lexical, semantic, and recognition memory tasks. We combined motivation and emotional valence ratings to provide a composite measure that might approximate a more general ‘reward’ construct. However, this was worse at explaining task performance than the individual variables. We discuss implications of these results for neurocognitive theories of semantics.","['Facet (psychology)', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Psychology', 'Word (group theory)', 'Linguistics', 'Social psychology', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Personality', 'Big Five personality traits', 'Psychotherapist']",https://openalex.org/W4406232667,False,1,10.31234/osf.io/h9m8u,facet psychology meaning existential psychology word group theory linguistics social psychology cognitive psychology philosophy personality big personality traits psychotherapist reward facet word meaning ratings motivation english words semantic representations arise distillation multiple sources information including sensory motor affective interoceptive linguistic cognitive experience experience reward highly salient aspect human activities contribution semantic processing understood address present study took psycholinguistic approach measuring evaluating associations reward facet word meaning behavioral neurophysiological data suggest reward processing involves multiple stages mechanisms instance systems associated experience anticipation pleasure response reward appear distinct motivational processes underlie pursuit stimulus sought collect novel set word ratings capture extent reward related experience initial explorations revealed reward pleasure ratings highly correlated existing norms emotional valence ratings association motivation moderately correlated valence suggesting capture distinct semantic information conducted preregistered large scale study obtain motivation ratings words analyses suggest ratings capture aspects word meaning distinct semantic dimensions concreteness valence explain unique variance participant performance lexical semantic recognition memory tasks combined motivation emotional valence ratings provide composite measure approximate general reward construct worse explaining task performance individual variables discuss implications results neurocognitive theories semantics,1
"Quantifying children's sensorimotor experience: Child body-object interaction ratings for 3,359 English words",2022,10.31234/osf.io/cb3fe,,Emiko J. Muraki; Israa A. Siddiqui; Penny M. Pexman,"Body-object interaction (BOI) ratings measure how easily the human body can physically interact with a word's referent. Previous research has found that words higher in BOI tend to be processed more quickly and accurately in tasks such as lexical decision, semantic decision, and syntactic classification, suggesting that sensorimotor information is an important aspect of lexical knowledge. However, limited research has examined the importance of sensorimotor information from a developmental perspective. One barrier to addressing such theoretical questions has been a lack of semantic dimension ratings that take into account child sensorimotor experience. The goal of the current study was to collect Child BOI rating norms. Parents of children aged 5 – 9-years-old were asked to rate words according to how easily an average 6-year-old child can interact with each word’s referent. The relationships of Child and Adult BOI ratings with other lexical semantic dimensions were assessed, as well as the relationships of Child and Adult BOI ratings with age of acquisition. Child BOI ratings were more strongly related to valence and sensory experience ratings than Adult BOI ratings and were a better predictor of three different measures of age of acquisition. The results suggest that child-centric ratings such as those reported here provide a more sensitive measure of children’s experience that can be used to address theoretical questions in embodied cognition from a developmental perspective.","['Referent', 'Psychology', 'Embodied cognition', 'Perspective (graphical)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Cognition', 'Object (grammar)', 'Valence (chemistry)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Age of Acquisition', 'Linguistics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience']",https://openalex.org/W4206456834,True,1,10.31234/osf.io/cb3fe,referent psychology embodied cognition perspective graphical cognitive psychology cognition object grammar valence chemistry developmental psychology age acquisition linguistics artificial intelligence computer science philosophy physics quantum mechanics neuroscience quantifying children sensorimotor experience child body object interaction ratings english words body object interaction boi ratings measure easily human body physically interact word referent previous research words higher boi tend processed quickly accurately tasks lexical decision semantic decision syntactic classification suggesting sensorimotor information important aspect lexical knowledge limited research examined importance sensorimotor information developmental perspective barrier addressing theoretical questions lack semantic dimension ratings account child sensorimotor experience goal current study collect child boi rating norms parents children aged years old asked rate words according easily average year old child interact words referent relationships child adult boi ratings lexical semantic dimensions assessed relationships child adult boi ratings age acquisition child boi ratings strongly related valence sensory experience ratings adult boi ratings better predictor different measures age acquisition results suggest child centric ratings reported provide sensitive measure childrens experience used address theoretical questions embodied cognition developmental perspective,1
Lexical connectivity effects in immediate serial recall of words,2020,10.31234/osf.io/sv35f,,Matthew HC Mak; Yaling Hsiao; Kate Nation,"In four experiments, we tested whether immediate serial recall is influenced by a word’s degree centrality, an index of lexical connectivity. Words of high degree centrality are associated with more words in free association norms than those of low degree centrality. Experiment 1 reanalysed four existing datasets (collected for other purposes) to explore the effect of degree centrality in scrambled wordlists. Results indicated that high-degree (vs. low-degree) words are advantaged across all serial positions, independently of other variables including word frequency. Experiment 2 replicated this finding using an expanded stimulus set. Experiment 3 used pure lists with each list containing high- or low-degree words only. Once again, high-degree words were better recalled across all serial positions, and this could not be explained by other psycholinguistic variables. Experiment 4 used alternating lists, within which high- and low-degree words alternated. High-degree words were no longer advantaged overall. Instead, recall of low-degree words was facilitated when neighboured by high-degree words. We conclude that degree centrality is a distinct variable that affects serial recall and consider its influence both as an item-level characteristic that reflects how accessible a word is and as an inter-item property that captures how well associative links can be formed between words.","['Degree (music)', 'Centrality', 'Recall', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Associative property', 'Psychology', 'Word (group theory)', 'Computer science', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Statistics', 'Physics', 'Geometry', 'Acoustics', 'Pure mathematics', 'Programming language']",https://openalex.org/W4256566372,True,3,10.31234/osf.io/sv35f,degree music centrality recall set abstract data type associative property psychology word group theory computer science cognitive psychology mathematics statistics physics geometry acoustics pure mathematics programming language lexical connectivity effects immediate serial recall words experiments tested immediate serial recall influenced words degree centrality index lexical connectivity words high degree centrality associated words free association norms low degree centrality experiment reanalysed existing datasets collected purposes explore effect degree centrality scrambled wordlists results indicated high degree vs low degree words advantaged serial positions independently variables including word frequency experiment replicated finding using expanded stimulus set experiment used pure lists list containing high low degree words high degree words better recalled serial positions explained psycholinguistic variables experiment used alternating lists high low degree words alternated high degree words longer advantaged overall instead recall low degree words facilitated neighboured high degree words conclude degree centrality distinct variable affects serial recall consider influence item level characteristic reflects accessible word inter item property captures associative links formed words,1
Comparing child word associations to adult associative norms: Evidence for child-specific associations with a strong priming effect in 3-year-olds,2024,10.3758/s13428-024-02414-3,Behavior Research Methods,Nadine Fitzpatrick; Caroline Floccia,"Abstract Investigating how infants first establish relationships between words is a necessary step towards understanding how an interconnected network of semantic relationships develops in the adult lexical-semantic system. Stimuli selection for these child studies is critical since words must be both familiar and highly imageable. However, there has been a reliance on adult word association norms to inform stimuli selection in English infant studies to date, as no resource currently exists for child-specific word associations. We present three experiments that explore the strength of word–word relationships in 3-year-olds. Experiment 1 collected children’s word associations (WA) ( N = 150; female = 84, L1 = British English) and compared them to adult associative norms (Moss &amp; Older, 1996; Nelson et al., 2004 ( Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, &amp; Computers, 36(3), 402–407)). Experiment 2 replicated WAs from Experiment 1 in an online adaptation of the task ( N = 24: 13 female, L1 = British English). Both experiments indicated a high proportion of child-specific WAs not represented in adult norms (Moss &amp; Older, 1996; Nelson et al., 2004 ( Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, &amp; Computers, 36(3), 402–407)). Experiment 3 tested noun–noun WAs from these responses in an online semantic priming study ( N = 40: 19 female, L1 = British English) and found that association type modulated priming ( F (2.57, 100.1) = 13.13, p &lt;. 0001, generalized η 2 =.19).

Based on the language sample analysis, we ascertained typical NDW values at the aforementioned ages and tested through a linear mixed-effects model whether gender and age affected NDW.The results showed that age significantly predicted NDW increase; gender did not emerge as a significant predictor of NDW, but this may be due to the small statistical power.This study intends to provide the first step towards longitudinal investigation of the level of NDW for CYG-speaking children with a typical course of language development.

The Effect of Age and Task Complexity on the Microstructure of Child Arabic Narratives,2023,10.1044/2023_lshss-22-00091,Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools,Abdessatar Mahfoudhi; Fauzia Abdalla; Nailah Al-Sulaihim,"This study examines the development of narrative microstructure elements of productivity, lexical diversity, and syntactic complexity in the oral story production of preschool- and school-age Kuwaiti Arabic-speaking children. It also explores the effects of story task complexity on the target microstructural features.This study employed a cross-sectional research design and enrolled 96 monolingual speakers of Kuwaiti Arabic. Four groups of children aged 4;0-7;11 (years;months) were randomly recruited from public schools across Kuwait. The groups consisted of 22 four-year-olds (Kindergarten 1), 24 five-year-olds (Kindergarten 2), 25 six-year-olds (Grade 1), and 25 seven-year-olds (Grade 2). Two sets of sequential pictures from the Edmonton Narrative Norms Instrument were used to elicit storytelling from all participants: a one-episode story and a more complex three-episode story.The children's stories were analyzed to determine if there were differences in narrative microstructure as a function of age and task complexity. The data indicated that productivity, lexical diversity, and syntactic structures increased with task complexity. The length of communication units, the average mean length of the three longest utterances, and the amount and variety of words in the children's productions were all significantly larger in the more complex story. Only one syntactic structure showed age as well as task effects.Clinical recommendations include adapting the coding scheme to fit Arabic data, using the more complex narrative alone for microstructure analysis, and calculating only a few measures for productivity and syntactic complexity to save time.","['Lexical diversity', 'Narrative', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Storytelling', 'Task (project management)', 'Developmental psychology', 'Vocabulary', 'Philosophy', 'Management', 'Economics']",https://openalex.org/W4380550520,False,1,10.1044/2023_lshss-22-00091,lexical diversity narrative psychology linguistics storytelling task project management developmental psychology vocabulary philosophy management economics effect age task complexity microstructure child arabic narratives study examines development narrative microstructure elements productivity lexical diversity syntactic complexity oral story production preschool school age kuwaiti arabic speaking children explores effects story task complexity target microstructural features study employed cross sectional research design enrolled monolingual speakers kuwaiti arabic groups children aged years months randomly recruited public schools kuwait groups consisted year olds kindergarten year olds kindergarten year olds grade seven year olds grade sets sequential pictures edmonton narrative norms instrument used elicit storytelling participants episode story complex episode story children stories analyzed determine differences narrative microstructure function age task complexity data indicated productivity lexical diversity syntactic structures increased task complexity length communication units average mean length longest utterances variety words children productions significantly larger complex story syntactic structure showed age task effects clinical recommendations include adapting coding scheme fit arabic data using complex narrative microstructure analysis calculating measures productivity syntactic complexity save time,1
Learning from others' experience: A taste of parallel corpus analysis for translation students and budding corpus researchers,2021,10.11606/issn.2317-9511.v37p370-396,Tradterm,Silvia Bernardini,"This contribution describes the potential of parallel corpus analysis for the development of research skills in the translation classroom.

Two more unorthodox uses of parallel corpora to tap into translators' domain-specific knowledge, and as aids in the interpretation of culturally salient historical and literary texts, are also discussed.","['Lemma (botany)', 'Linguistics', 'Syntagmatic analysis', 'Salient', 'Taste', 'Construct (python library)', 'Verb', 'Interpretation (philosophy)', 'Meaning (existential)', 'Psychology', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Philosophy', 'Ecology', 'Poaceae', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychotherapist', 'Biology', 'Programming language']",https://openalex.org/W3163911077,True,1,10.11606/issn.2317-9511.v37p370-396,lemma botany linguistics syntagmatic analysis salient taste construct python library verb interpretation philosophy meaning existential psychology computer science artificial intelligence philosophy ecology poaceae neuroscience psychotherapist biology programming language learning experience taste parallel corpus analysis translation students budding corpus researchers contribution describes potential parallel corpus analysis development research skills translation classroom using culinary texts case point specifically culturally salient italian text turn th century pellegrino artusi la scienza cucina e l arte del mangiar bene science kitchen art eating original italian translated english version detailed analysis offered italian equivalents verb lemma cook english equivalents italian verb lemma cuocere showing paradigmatic syntagmatic insights obtained used construct bilingual lexical terminological profiles units meaning shed light translation strategies norms depending research hypotheses variables unorthodox uses parallel corpora tap translators domain specific knowledge aids interpretation culturally salient historical literary texts discussed,1
Acoustic Correlates of Rhotic Emphasis in Fessi Spoken Arabic,2019,10.4000/books.iremam.3986,Institut de recherches et d’études sur les mondes arabes et musulmans eBooks,Aaron Freeman,"This paper considers the phonological patterning of pharyngealised /r/ in a dialect of Moroccan Arabic. Through acoustic analysis of recorded interviews targeting specific vocabulary and morphological paradigms, I describe a marginally contrastive distribution of emphatic and plain rhotic variants among Arabic speakers in Fès, indicating that pharyngealised variants trigger a process similar to, but distinct from, the emphasis spread associated with the canonical emphatic consonants /ṭ/, /ḍ/, and /ṣ/. While in some varieties of Arabic, rhotic pharyngealisation is an allophonic alternation conditioned by adjacent back vowels, in others [ṛ] has spread through morphological and lexical diffusion to attain quasi-phonemic status. In the changing urban dialect of Fès, the presence of conflicting dialect norms allows us to study how individuals resolve ambiguous phonological input with respect to /ṛ/, and how this is manifested in their phonetic output.For this study, I conducted 24 mixed sociolinguistic/phonetic interviews, with the help of native Fessi interview assistants. The interviews provide a comprehensive sample of rhotics for each speaker, which were analyzed for their phonetic effects on adjacent vowels. The acoustic data indicate a wide range of individual variability in the patterning of emphatic /ṛ/, tempered by predictable patterns in certain paradigms such as ḥmaṛ ‘donkey’ with non-emphatic plural ḥmir, or the minimal contrast between biṛan ‘bars’ and biran ‘wells’. Speakers also exhibited variability in the scope of pharyngealisation spread from /ṛ/, even though all speakers exhibited predictable long-range spread from /ṭ/, /ṣ/, and /ḍ/. These results point to a phonological change in progress, moving in the direction of phonemic pharyngealized /ṛ/.","['Arabic', 'Emphasis (telecommunications)', 'Linguistics', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Telecommunications']",https://openalex.org/W2913857745,True,2,10.4000/books.iremam.3986,arabic emphasis telecommunications linguistics computer science philosophy telecommunications acoustic correlates rhotic emphasis fessi spoken arabic paper considers phonological patterning pharyngealised r dialect moroccan arabic acoustic analysis recorded interviews targeting specific vocabulary morphological paradigms marginally contrastive distribution emphatic plain rhotic variants arabic speakers fes indicating pharyngealised variants trigger process similar distinct emphasis spread associated canonical emphatic consonants t d s varieties arabic rhotic pharyngealisation allophonic alternation conditioned adjacent vowels r spread morphological lexical diffusion attain quasi phonemic status changing urban dialect fes presence conflicting dialect norms allows study individuals resolve ambiguous phonological input respect r manifested phonetic output study conducted mixed sociolinguistic phonetic interviews help native fessi interview assistants interviews provide comprehensive sample rhotics speaker analyzed phonetic effects adjacent vowels acoustic data indicate wide range individual variability patterning emphatic r tempered predictable patterns certain paradigms hmar donkey non emphatic plural hmir minimal contrast biran bars biran wells speakers exhibited variability scope pharyngealisation spread r speakers exhibited predictable long range spread t s d results point phonological change progress moving direction phonemic pharyngealized r,1
Does first word development in bilingual French-Portuguese toddlers mirror monolingual one?

Nous avons testé 15,bilingues français-portugais (7 de 16 mois et 8 de 24 mois). Leur, développement langagier a été évalué avec l'Inventaire du développement, communicatif français et portugais (adaptations du CDI MacArthur-Bates, Fenson et al., 2007). Des questionnaires parentaux ont été utilisés pour,évaluer la dominance linguistique (PaBiQ, Tuller, 2015), les stades de, développement (ASQ-3™, Squires et al., 2009) et les fonctions exécutives,(BRIEF-P, Gioia, Aspy, … Isquith, 2003). Nous avons calculé la taille du, vocabulaire dans chacune des langues, le vocabulaire total et le vocabulaire, conceptuel total et comparé avec les normes des monolingues. Presque, tous les participants ont un vocabulaire total dans chacune des langues,(français ou portugais) et un vocabulaire conceptuel total similaire à celui, des monolingues portugais et français.

“A vulgarity of style which lies deeper than grammatical solecisms”: developing a corpus-assisted approach to identifying prescriptive and normative discourses,2024,10.3366/cor.2024.0306,Corpora,Beth Malory,"This paper explores a novel methodological approach to the study of prescriptive language norm dissemination. It reports the result of a study which uses Corpus-Assisted Discourse Studies (cads) inductively, to identify lexis and discursive patterns indicative of normativity and prescriptivism, in a corpus of literary reviews from Late Modern English. Previous attempts to identify prescriptivism using corpus-based approaches have tended to proceed deductively, using pre-defined indicators of prescriptivism. However, this study uses a speculative research model which proceeds inductively, allowing the datatset to direct the analysis. Thus, whereas research using pre-defined ‘indicators of prescriptivism’ risks overlooking significant patterns of usage, this approach facilitates a synergy of quantitative and qualitative corpus methods which both yields a broad overview of usage patterns and enables in-depth analysis of relevant discourses. Keywords are used to engage quantitatively with a purpose-built corpus, before collocation and concordancing are used iteratively, allowing immersion of the researcher in the dataset. This methodology yields a set of lexical items which identify moments of prescriptivism and/or normativity in the purpose-built corpus. The findings reported demonstrate the promise of using discourse analytic procedures to examine the performance and dissemination of normativity, in a way that could ultimately be replicated in different contexts.","['Vulgarity', 'Normative', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Sociology', 'Linguistics', 'Demonstrative', 'Epistemology', 'Psychology', 'Aesthetics', 'Philosophy', 'Literature', 'Art']",https://openalex.org/W4401431618,False,1,10.3366/cor.2024.0306,vulgarity normative style visual arts sociology linguistics demonstrative epistemology psychology aesthetics philosophy literature art vulgarity style lies deeper grammatical solecisms developing corpus assisted approach identifying prescriptive normative discourses paper explores novel methodological approach study prescriptive language norm dissemination reports result study uses corpus assisted discourse studies cads inductively identify lexis discursive patterns indicative normativity prescriptivism corpus literary reviews late modern english previous attempts identify prescriptivism using corpus based approaches tended proceed deductively using pre defined indicators prescriptivism study uses speculative research model proceeds inductively allowing datatset direct analysis research using pre defined indicators prescriptivism risks overlooking significant patterns usage approach facilitates synergy quantitative qualitative corpus methods yields broad overview usage patterns enables depth analysis relevant discourses keywords used engage quantitatively purpose built corpus collocation concordancing used iteratively allowing immersion researcher dataset methodology yields set lexical items identify moments prescriptivism normativity purpose built corpus findings reported demonstrate promise using discourse analytic procedures examine performance dissemination normativity way ultimately replicated different contexts,1
Lexical connectivity effects in immediate serial recall of words,2020,10.31219/osf.io/5yp4r,,Matthew HC Mak; Yaling Hsiao; Kate Nation,"In four experiments, we tested whether immediate serial recall is influenced by a word’s degree centrality, an index of lexical connectivity. Words of high degree centrality are associated with more words in free association norms than those of low degree centrality. Experiment 1 reanalysed four existing datasets (collected for other purposes) to explore the effect of degree centrality in scrambled wordlists. Results indicated that high-degree (vs. low-degree) words are advantaged across all serial positions, independently of other variables including word frequency. Experiment 2 replicated this finding using an expanded stimulus set. Experiment 3 used pure lists with each list containing high- or low-degree words only. Once again, high-degree words were better recalled across all serial positions, and this could not be explained by other psycholinguistic variables. Experiment 4 used alternating lists, within which high- and low-degree words alternated. High-degree words were no longer advantaged overall. Instead, recall of low-degree words was facilitated when neighboured by high-degree words. We conclude that degree centrality is a distinct variable that affects serial recall and consider its influence both as an item-level characteristic that reflects how accessible a word is and as an inter-item property that captures how well associative links can be formed between words.","['Degree (music)', 'Centrality', 'Recall', 'Set (abstract data type)', 'Associative property', 'Psychology', 'Word (group theory)', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Computer science', 'Mathematics', 'Statistics', 'Physics', 'Acoustics', 'Programming language', 'Geometry', 'Pure mathematics']",https://openalex.org/W4255335561,True,1,10.31219/osf.io/5yp4r,degree music centrality recall set abstract data type associative property psychology word group theory cognitive psychology computer science mathematics statistics physics acoustics programming language geometry pure mathematics lexical connectivity effects immediate serial recall words experiments tested immediate serial recall influenced words degree centrality index lexical connectivity words high degree centrality associated words free association norms low degree centrality experiment reanalysed existing datasets collected purposes explore effect degree centrality scrambled wordlists results indicated high degree vs low degree words advantaged serial positions independently variables including word frequency experiment replicated finding using expanded stimulus set experiment used pure lists list containing high low degree words high degree words better recalled serial positions explained psycholinguistic variables experiment used alternating lists high low degree words alternated high degree words longer advantaged overall instead recall low degree words facilitated neighboured high degree words conclude degree centrality distinct variable affects serial recall consider influence item level characteristic reflects accessible word inter item property captures associative links formed words,1

German in childhood and Latin in adolescence: On the bidialectal nature of lexical access in English,2019,10.31219/osf.io/2fjtg,,Arturo E. Hernández; Juliana Ronderos; Tres Bodet; Hannah Claussenius‐Kalman; Ferenc Bunta,"The nature of word etymology, long a topic of interest in linguistics, has been considered to a much lesser extent in the word recognition literature. The present study created a database of overlapping words from the English Lexicon Project (ELP) and a database with age of acquisition (AoA) norms which were categorized as either Germanic or Latin-based. Results revealed that Germanic words were learned earlier than Latin-based words. Germanic words also showed lower reaction times and higher accuracy relative to Latin-based words even when controlling for AoA, word frequency and length. Additionally analyses were conducted using a publicly available database that used crowdsourcing data with native and second language (L2)English speakers. The results with native speakers were similar to those collected with the ELP. However, nonnative speakers showed better accuracy and faster reaction times for Latin-based words compared to Germanic words. The findings support a bidialectal view of English in that Germanic words serve as the base of lexical processing during childhood, whereas Latin-based words fill in the lexical space across adolescence and into early adulthood. Furthermore, L2 speakers appear to acquire English via more advanced Latin-based vocabulary relative to native speakers. These results carry implications for theories of word recognition and the processing of lexical items in populations that come from linguistically diverse backgrounds.","['Lexicon', 'German', 'Linguistics', 'Vocabulary', 'Etymology', 'Computer science', 'Cognate', 'Psychology', 'Natural language processing', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4233591622,True,0,10.31219/osf.io/2fjtg,lexicon german linguistics vocabulary etymology computer science cognate psychology natural language processing artificial intelligence philosophy german childhood latin adolescence bidialectal nature lexical access english nature word etymology long topic linguistics considered lesser extent word recognition literature present study created database overlapping words english lexicon project elp database age acquisition aoa norms categorized germanic latin based results revealed germanic words learned earlier latin based words germanic words showed lower reaction times higher accuracy relative latin based words controlling aoa word frequency length additionally analyses conducted using publicly available database used crowdsourcing data native second language l english speakers results native speakers similar collected elp nonnative speakers showed better accuracy faster reaction times latin based words compared germanic words findings support bidialectal view english germanic words serve base lexical processing childhood latin based words lexical space adolescence early adulthood furthermore l speakers appear acquire english advanced latin based vocabulary relative native speakers results carry implications theories word recognition processing lexical items populations come linguistically diverse backgrounds,1
On the corpus of speech samples with errors in the use of Russian as a foreign language: methods of data representation and deep markup parameters,2022,10.37493/2409-1030.2022.4.17,Гуманитарные и юридические исследования,S. V. Gusarenko; M. K. Gusarenko,"The purpose of the study, the results of which are presented in the article, is to develop the optimal composition and method of presenting data in the developed corpus of Russian speech samples with errors made by foreign students. The development of such a corpus is conditioned, firstly, by the need for a scientific description of erroneous linguistic expressions, as all significant facts of the use of the language are currently being described, and secondly, by the need to create a unified database of systematized data on errors in the speech of Russian language learners for linguodidactic purposes. The creation of such a corpus requires an in-depth description of errors in speech, therefore, in this article, it is proposed to describe an erroneous linguistic expression as a violation of a certain language norm, a certain semantic, morphological, syntactic or lexical language model underlying the normatively correct expression, indicating the type of speech activity, speech situation, native language, specialty of the student. Within the framework of the task of creating a corpus, an error is understood as a failure at a certain level of speech generation, therefore, the model for describing errors is based on the model for describing language expressions developed by domestic researchers when creating an explanatory-combinatorial dictionary. The model of deep annotation of erroneous expressions proposed in the article includes schematized models of semantic representation, syntactic and lexical compatibility (depending on the nature of the error) of a linguistic expression, which is intended, on the one hand, to accurately localize the error in the use of the language, on the other hand, to serve as educational material in linguodidactics. It is concluded that when a statistically significant number of annotated samples with errors in Russian speech made by foreign students is reached, these corpora may well be used as a source of empirical data for a comprehensive scientific description of the facts of linguistic reality. It was also concluded that for the proposed corpus to be viable, it must be an open system that involves the inclusion of new description parameters in deep annotation.","['Computer science', 'Natural language processing', 'Speech error', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Expression (computer science)', 'Linguistics', 'Speech corpus', 'Text corpus', 'Markup language', 'Speech production', 'Speech recognition', 'Speech synthesis', 'Philosophy', 'XML', 'Programming language', 'Operating system']",https://openalex.org/W4399896277,False,0,10.37493/2409-1030.2022.4.17,computer science natural language processing speech error artificial intelligence expression computer science linguistics speech corpus text corpus markup language speech production speech recognition speech synthesis philosophy xml programming language operating corpus speech samples errors use russian foreign language methods data representation deep markup parameters purpose study results presented article develop optimal composition method presenting data developed corpus russian speech samples errors foreign students development corpus conditioned firstly need scientific description erroneous linguistic expressions significant facts use language currently described secondly need create unified database systematized data errors speech russian language learners linguodidactic purposes creation corpus requires depth description errors speech article proposed erroneous linguistic expression violation certain language norm certain semantic morphological syntactic lexical language model underlying normatively correct expression indicating type speech activity speech situation native language specialty student framework task creating corpus error understood failure certain level speech generation model describing errors based model describing language expressions developed domestic researchers creating explanatory combinatorial dictionary model deep annotation erroneous expressions proposed article includes schematized models semantic representation syntactic lexical compatibility depending nature error linguistic expression intended hand accurately localize error use language hand serve educational material linguodidactics concluded statistically significant number annotated samples errors russian speech foreign students reached corpora used source empirical data comprehensive scientific description facts linguistic reality concluded proposed corpus viable open involves inclusion new description parameters deep annotation,1
Curating and extending data for language comparison in Concepticon and NoRaRe,2022,10.12688/openreseurope.15380.1,Open Research Europe,Annika Tjuka; Robert Forkel; Johann‐Mattis List,"<ns4:p>Over the past decade, there have been several attempts to standardize cross-linguistic datasets. Since language comparison is a notoriously difficult endeavor, it requires tools that facilitate standardization and are convenient to use. The Concepticon is based on a toolkit provided for cross-linguistic comparison and offers a reference catalog for comparable concepts that appear in concept lists. While curating the Concepticon, we found that a variety of studies in distinct research fields collected information on word properties. However, until recently, no resource existed that contained these data to enable the comparison of the different word properties across languages. This gap was filled by the Database of Norms, Ratings, and Relations (NoRaRe), which is an extension of the Concepticon. Here, we present the major release of both resources - Concepticon Version 3.0 and NoRaRe Version 1.0 - which represents an important step in our data development. We show that extending and adapting the data curation workflow in Concepticon to NoRaRe is useful for the standardization of cross-linguistic datasets. In addition, combining datasets from different research fields enables studies grounded in language comparison. Concepticon and NoRaRe include lexical data for various languages, tools for test-driven data curation, and the possibility for data reuse.

A Descriptive Analysis of Non-obligatory Shifts in Three Disney Animated Films Dubbed into Modern Standard Arabic,2022,10.2139/ssrn.3998701,SSRN Electronic Journal,Dana Sulaiman AlSuhaim,"This qualitative quantitative descriptive-analytical study aimed to describe the non-obligatory shifts employed in three English Disney animated films dubbed into MSA by applying Toury’s (1995/2012) normative model and shifts introduced in the course of his applied case studies. The researcher described and analyzed preliminary, initial and operational norms (non-obligatory shifts) employed on the level of three textual segments: the lexical-semantic, the stylistic, and the prosodic.

About an online dictionary of the pluricentric Hungarian language,2022,10.58423/2786-6726/2022-1-27-42,Acta Academiae Beregsasiensis Philologica,Réka Máté; Enikő Tóth; István Csernicskó,"A pluricentric language is a language that is used in at least two countries where it has the official status of a state, commonwealth or regional language with at least partially its own (codified) norms that usually contribute to the personal identity of speakers. Pluricentric languages have one dominant variant and (one or) several non-dominant varieties. As a result of the political fragmentation of the Hungarian language area that developed after the First World War, and then, confirmed by the peace treaties after the Second World War, the Hungarian language is one of the pluricentric languages in Europe. The article examines the results of close linguistic contacts in non-dominant varieties of the modern Hungarian language used outside Hungary. The consequences of language contacts are highlighted on the basis of lexical borrowings, which are fixed in a specific online dictionary. The dictionary consists of borrowed words of foreign origin used by autochthonous Hungarian minorities living in the Carpathian Basin outside Hungary. In addition to words and phrases that are used exclusively in the speech and writing of Hungarians in countries neighboring Hungary, words that are also used in Hungary, but with a different meaning, were also collected in the database. As of the end of September 2022, the dictionary database contained 5,034 dictionary entries (words). Since this online loanword list contains direct borrowings from many languages of the Carpathian Basin that are in contact with Hungarian (mostly from the official or state languages of Hungary's neighboring countries, including Slovak, Ukrainian, Romanian, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, and German), the database is a rich source for the study of contacts between Hungarian and Indo-European languages. Based on the material of the online dictionary, it was found that among the lexical borrowings of the Hungarian language –as a result of centuries-old contacts between Hungarian and various Slavic languages –borrowings of Slavic origin constitute the largest layer of vocabulary of foreign origin in the Hungarian language. The result of the project is a dictionary database that provides an opportunity for a comparative analysis of the vocabulary of non-dominant variants of the pluricentric Hungarian language.","['Serbian', 'Linguistics', 'Slovak', 'Ukrainian', 'Language contact', 'Romanian', 'Loanword', 'Official language', 'Lexical item', 'History', 'Czech', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4313322961,True,0,10.58423/2786-6726/2022-1-27-42,serbian linguistics slovak ukrainian language contact romanian loanword official language lexical item history czech philosophy online dictionary pluricentric hungarian language pluricentric language language used countries official status state commonwealth regional language partially codified norms usually contribute personal identity speakers pluricentric languages dominant variant non dominant varieties result political fragmentation hungarian language area developed world war confirmed peace treaties second world war hungarian language pluricentric languages europe article examines results close linguistic contacts non dominant varieties modern hungarian language used outside hungary consequences language contacts highlighted basis lexical borrowings fixed specific online dictionary dictionary consists borrowed words foreign origin used autochthonous hungarian minorities living carpathian basin outside hungary addition words phrases used exclusively speech writing hungarians countries neighboring hungary words used hungary different meaning collected database end september dictionary database contained dictionary entries words online loanword list contains direct borrowings languages carpathian basin contact hungarian official state languages hungary neighboring countries including slovak ukrainian romanian serbian croatian slovenian german database rich source study contacts hungarian indo european languages based material online dictionary lexical borrowings hungarian language result centuries old contacts hungarian various slavic languages borrowings slavic origin constitute largest layer vocabulary foreign origin hungarian language result project dictionary database provides opportunity comparative analysis vocabulary non dominant variants pluricentric hungarian language,1

Register and Layout in Epistolary Judeo-Arabic,2019,10.1007/s10835-019-09331-5,Jewish History,Esther-Miriam Wagner,"Abstract Medieval letters from the Cairo Geniza can be broadly classified into private, official, or mercantile correspondence, and all use particular linguistic registers. Official correspondence, for example, shows abundant code switching into Hebrew and the employment of high-style versus lower-style prose. Mercantile letters actively avoid Hebrew and emulate supraconfessional Arabic writing standards. Private letters typically display more colloquial and less standardized forms than other genres and are more often written in crude handwriting. Among these private letters, we find one written by or for women that share common features of colloquiality and less standardization even when they are transcribed by male scribes. Linguistic registers are also influenced by the time and place in which they are written, and comparing Geniza letters from different areas and time periods exposes geographic and chronological characteristics. For example, North African letters tend to be linguistically more conservative, and Babylonian and Egyptian letters show differences in layout and style. Throughout the medieval period, orthographic, grammatical, lexical, and stylistic changes in the letters reflect social and economic evolution over time. The principal trend is a distinct move away from prescriptive Arabic linguistic norms from the late twelfth century on.","['Genizah', 'Register (sociolinguistics)', 'Style (visual arts)', 'Hebrew', 'Arabic', 'Linguistics', 'History', 'Arabic script', 'Period (music)', 'Classics', 'Judaism', 'Art', 'Philosophy', 'Archaeology', 'Aesthetics']",https://openalex.org/W2989460000,True,0,10.1007/s10835-019-09331-5,genizah register sociolinguistics style visual arts hebrew arabic linguistics history arabic script period music classics judaism art philosophy archaeology aesthetics register layout epistolary judeo arabic abstract medieval letters cairo geniza broadly classified private official mercantile correspondence use particular linguistic registers official correspondence example shows abundant code switching hebrew employment high style versus lower style prose mercantile letters actively avoid hebrew emulate supraconfessional arabic writing standards private letters typically display colloquial standardized forms genres written crude handwriting private letters written women share common features colloquiality standardization transcribed male scribes linguistic registers influenced time place written comparing geniza letters different areas time periods exposes geographic chronological characteristics example north african letters tend linguistically conservative babylonian egyptian letters differences layout style medieval period orthographic grammatical lexical stylistic changes letters reflect social economic evolution time principal trend distinct away prescriptive arabic linguistic norms late twelfth century,1
Language Creolization in Contemporary English-Language Nigerian Media Discourse,2025,10.24224/2227-1295-2025-14-4-211-230,Nauchnyi Dialog,Tatyana G. Voloshina; Ya. А. Glebova,"This study analyzes the current state of the Nigerian variety of English within the English-language media landscape of Nigeria. The primary objective of the article is to assess the degree of creolization of the English language at the phonetic, morphological, lexical, and syntactic levels in the Nigerian online newspaper “Punch.” Unique characteristics of English-language Nigerian media discourse are identified, including a limited range of topics and publication volume, a predominance of analytical and informational article genres, and the creolization of English. It is demonstrated that phonetic creolization is associated with highly productive transformational processes such as assimilation and epenthesis. Morphological creolization is observed through deviations from standard norms in the formation of tense aspects of verbs, the conversion of direct speech into indirect speech, and the omission of prepositions. The article reports that lexical creolization in English-language Nigerian media discourse is linked to frequent borrowings from both European and local languages, as well as the adaptation of idiomatic expressions to local linguistic and cultural contexts. It is asserted that syntactic creolization manifests as inverted word order in sentences.","['Creolization', 'Linguistics', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4410960798,True,0,10.24224/2227-1295-2025-14-4-211-230,creolization linguistics sociology history philosophy language creolization contemporary english language nigerian media discourse study analyzes current state nigerian variety english english language media landscape nigeria primary objective article assess degree creolization english language phonetic morphological lexical syntactic levels nigerian online newspaper punch unique characteristics english language nigerian media discourse identified including limited range topics publication volume predominance analytical informational article genres creolization english demonstrated phonetic creolization associated highly productive transformational processes assimilation epenthesis morphological creolization observed deviations standard norms formation tense aspects verbs conversion direct speech indirect speech omission prepositions article reports lexical creolization english language nigerian media discourse linked frequent borrowings european local languages adaptation idiomatic expressions local linguistic cultural contexts asserted syntactic creolization manifests inverted word order sentences,1

Willems,"This study is a cross-linguistic, conceptual replication of Lynott and Connell’s (2009, 2013) modality exclusivity norms. Their English properties and concepts were translated into Dutch, then independently tested as follows. Forty-two respondents rated the auditory, haptic, and visual strength of those words. Mean ratings were then computed, with a high interrater reliability and interitem consistency. Based on the three modalities, each word also features a specific modality exclusivity, and a dominant modality. The norms also include external measures of word frequency, length, distinctiveness, age of acquisition, and known percentage.<br>Starting with the results, unimodal, bimodal, and tri-modal words appear. Visual and haptic experience are quite related, leaving a more independent auditory experience. These different relations are important because they may correlate with different levels of detail in word comprehension (Louwerse &amp; Connell, 2011). Auditory and visual words tend towards unimodality, whereas haptic words tend towards multimodality. Likewise, properties are more unimodal than concepts. The form of words is not quite as arbitrary as we used to think. It is connected to their meaning. This 'sound symbolism' was tested by means of a regression: Auditory strength predicts lexical properties of the words (frequency, distinctiveness...) better than the other modalities do, or else with a different polarity.See a <b>brief article here.</b>ReferencesLouwerse, M., &amp; Connell, L.

Dicos 2020: Occitan Lexicon Online,2020,10.1353/ten.2020.0006,Tenso,Kathryn Klingebiel,"Dicos 2020: Occitan Lexicon Online Kathryn Klingebiel Keywords online Occitan lexical resources, Occitan lexicography, paralexicography, Congrès de la Lenga Occitana, Dicod’Òc, collaborative lexicography, crowdsourcing, digitization, multimedia database, Occitan dictionaries, Occitan dialects, nòrma classica, graphie alibertine, decentralization of the norm and of description, Conselh de la Lenga Occitana DICOS 2020 (<http://klingebiel.com/occitan/dicos.html>) continues to broaden its bibliographic documentation of online Occitan lexical resources. In 2016, a short article introduced readers of Tenso 31 to the DICOS site (Klingebiel “Occitan Lexicon Online”). The choice of “lexicon” in the title has proven its suitability, with its broad applicability to any listing of lexemes. DICOS was intended to list virtually everything that could provide access to Occitan lexical resources online. The great surprise from that first round of research was the sheer number of files located, more than 200, in a variety of digital formats. My initial enthusiasm has been tempered by three years’ worth of continued searching and evaluation. Revised and reorganized, DICOS 2020 is presented here with this caveat: while the Occitan lexicon is increasingly easy to explore online, in terms of coverage, relevance, and authenticity it is unevenly served by the internet. DICOS leaves readers free to judge individual resources by the degree to which they conform to the parameters of formal lexicography, that is, analyzing and describing the “semantic, syntagmatic, and paradigmatic relationships within the lexicon of a language” (Wikidiff, s.v. lexicology/lexicography). These parameters are neatly summarized in the materials introducing the Diccionari general de la lenga occitana (DGLO): each entry is intended to specify gender; number; grammatical category; etymology or origin; first attestation; linguistic register; definition (in Occitan); translation (into French, Italian, Castilian, Catalan); a pan-Occitan referent (the most widely-used form across the Occitanophone territory); synonyms and antonyms; related expressions; regional variants; proverbs; literary citations and useful sources. Beyond the traditional parameters of lexicography, DICOS 2020 seamlessly accommodates works of paralexicography and of “lexicographie profane” (“crowdsourced lexicography” as a discipline of “citizen science”), in recognition of the three-way continuum of modern-day lexical resources. [End Page 75] The category of “para-lexicographie grand public” (Margarito 172), often accused of non-professional practices, includes such alternative resources as: glossaries of critical editions and anthologies, vocabularies of famous authors, nineteenth-century compilations of “gasconismes,” children’s picture dictionaries (ima[t]gièrs), listings of proverbs, translation sites, sites for language-learners, popularized listings of toponymy and etymology, and blog listings of “les mots de mon patois,” all found in DICOS 2020. Beyond the scope of DICOS, despite their demonstrable usefulness for lexical documentation, are: synonym, antonym, and rhyme dictionaries; travel phrasebooks; manuals of bon usage; spell-checkers; lexicons for computers; software for manipulating lexical data; and even the French-English-French discussion forum and other translation tools found at <www.reverso.net> and similar sites. Most of these works lying beyond the pale of canonical lexicography, “ouvrages qui occupent une marge floue, mais bien vivante” (Margarito 172), have appeared in response to the needs of electronic media and of crowdsourcing. While they comport certain risks,1 these works offer various advantages, including wide-ranging sources, relatively low cost of revision (as against reprinting), and ease of access and consultation. The modern generation of lexical resources has appeared in three stages: (i) digitization of print works (fr. rétroconversion); (ii) production of online dictionaries and databases; and (iii) creation of collaborative projects. Digitized versions of texts are widely available, e.g., the IEO-Paris’ “Documents per l’estudi de la lenga occitana,” with its more than 120 dictionaries and grammars of Occitan. Digitization has significantly modified the format of many print resources: e.g., the twenty-five volumes of the Französisches etymologisches [End Page 76] Wörterbuch (FEW), for the full Gallo-Romance lexicon, and the Dictionnaire de l’occitan médiéval (DOM), whose seven print fascicles (“a”–“album”) have been reworked into a single searchable online database which now covers “a” through “zyrt.” Selig and Arnold look at changes to the entire DOM infrastructure occurring in the course of digitization.

Not so SUBTLE(X): word frequency estimates and their fit to sentential reading times in interaction with predictability,2025,10.1515/ling-2024-0143,Linguistics,Katja I. Haeuser; Jutta Kray,"Abstract Frequency and predictability are two prominent psycholinguistic variables that determine the ease of word comprehension and have informed models of language processing. Here, we pooled the data from five self-paced reading studies to investigate (1) the usefulness of three well-known frequency databases of German in accounting for word reading times in context (i.e., the SUBTLEX-DE, CELEX, and dlexDB databases), and (2) whether frequency and predictability have additive or interactive effects on lexical processing. Regarding (1), goodness of fit comparisons between the three frequency measures showed that, in the majority of models, dlexDB frequencies performed best (in contrast to earlier investigations recommending to use SUBTLEX), even though nearly all frequency effects were statistically invariant and dwarfed by the contributions of other more potent variables such as predictability or trial number. Regarding (2), we found that, even though predictability influenced reading times, there was no evidence for interactive effects of frequency and predictability.

Common-Root Words: Between Synonymy and Paronymy,2023,10.31857/s160578800027392-7,Izvestiâ Rossijskoj akademii nauk. Seriâ literatury i âzyka,Daria V. Yakunina,"The article discusses the relationship between the concepts of synonymy and paronymy, as well as the functioning in the language of prefixal verbal paronyms. The definition of paronyms as common-rooted words with different affixes, which are regularly misused in speech as synonyms, is clarified. Some verbs on the synchronic level may be considered as synonyms or as paronyms, depending on the focus of the speaker’s or listener’s attention. As for the diachronic aspect of language study, there are processes of synonymization of common-root prefixal verbs, associated mainly with hypo-hyperonymic relations between lexical units. The possibility of synonymous use of common-root words is determined by the proximity of prefixes’ meanings, neutralization of the context and the norm’s inattention to changes in usage. The norm can either leave unnoticed the appearance of a new way of expressing linguistic meaning, or mark the changes in dictionaries, fixing the word as a synonym. Sometimes it can also insist on the preservation of paronymic distinctions even when there are already no such distinctions in usage. Thus, the paronyms remain the common-rooted words, which, mixing in speech usage, draw the norm’s attention to themselves.","['Root (linguistics)', 'Linguistics', 'Mathematics', 'Natural language processing', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4391636047,False,0,10.31857/s160578800027392-7,root linguistics linguistics mathematics natural language processing computer science philosophy common root words synonymy paronymy article discusses relationship concepts synonymy paronymy functioning language prefixal verbal paronyms definition paronyms common rooted words different affixes regularly misused speech synonyms clarified verbs synchronic level considered synonyms paronyms depending focus speakers listeners attention diachronic aspect language study processes synonymization common root prefixal verbs associated mainly hypo hyperonymic relations lexical units possibility synonymous use common root words determined proximity prefixes meanings neutralization context norms inattention changes usage norm leave unnoticed appearance new way expressing linguistic meaning mark changes dictionaries fixing word synonym insist preservation paronymic distinctions distinctions usage paronyms remain common rooted words mixing speech usage draw norms attention,1

The Galician MultiPic: a picture dataset that captures lexical variation,2025,10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1551000,Frontiers in Psychology,María Álvarez de la Granja; M. Carmen Parafita Couto; Ana Rita Sá-Leite; Isabel Fraga; Jon Andoni Duñabeitia; Christos Pliatsikas; Montserrat Comesaña,"In psycholinguistic research, careful selection and control of stimuli are essential for gaining insights into cognitive processes. Within this field, pictures often serve as stimuli, which requires the use of image databases to investigate linguistic, mnemonic, and visual perceptual phenomena in different populations (children without disabilities, adults, elderly people, illiterate, and brain-damage patients; see Soares et al., 2018 for more detail).Although several image databases provide norms for variables such as naming agreement (the most common name assigned to a picture by individuals; Snodgrass & Vanderwart, 1980), conceptual familiarity (the frequency with which individuals encounter or think about the depicted object; Snodgrass & Vanderwart, 1980) and visual complexity (judgments regarding the number of lines, intricacies, and details in an image; Snodgrass & Vanderwart, 1980; see also Székely & Bates, 2000 for an objective measure of picture visual complexity), these norms are available in multiple languages but are often restricted to a limited set of black-and-white line drawings (less than 300). Notably, such black-and-white images have been found to elicit weaker recognition compared to colored pictures (Sanfeliu & Fernandez, 1996;Rossion & Pourtois, 2004). In recent decades, there has been an increased effort to develop colored image datasets in various languages. However, many of them consider small datasets (usually less than 500 pictures, but see Brodeur et al., 2014;and Krautz & Keuleers, 2022, for more extensive datasets) and/or use different normalization protocols that complicate the process of comparing data and planning and executing cross-linguistic experiments (Soares et al., 2018;Duñabeitia et al., 2022;and Zhong et al, 2024 for overviews).The Multilingual Picture (MultiPic) database (Duñabeitia et al., 2022) was designed to address the limitations of previous databases by providing researchers with norms for naming agreement and concept familiarity for a set of colored images (500), selected from an initial pool of 750 images (Duñabeitia et al., 2018). To date, this database spans thirty-three languages, including American English, Australian English, Basque, Belgium Dutch, British English, Cantonese, Catalan, Cypriot Greek, Czech, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Lebanese Arabic, Malay, Malaysian English, Mandarin Chinese, Netherlands Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, European Portuguese, Quebec French, Rioplatense Spanish, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Turkish, and Welsh. The images depict specific concepts and general knowledge items, and the same data collection and preprocessing protocols were consistently applied across all languages.Expanding MultiPic to include additional languages, dialects, and language varieties worldwide would enable researchers to investigate lesser-studied languages beyond the predominant focus on English, facilitate direct cross-linguistic comparisons, and deepen our understanding of cognitive processes that are universal versus those that are language-specific. The primary objective of the present study was to norm MultiPic in Galician, a relatively under-researched language, enabling researchers to conduct studies with it. Galician is a Western Ibero-Romance language predominantly spoken in Galicia, an autonomous community in northwestern Spain, where it holds co-official status with Spanish.Psycholinguistic studies on Galician are less prevalent than those on Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, and Basque (see Comesaña & Sá-Leite, 2024). This paucity of research investigating the specific cognitive mechanisms involved in both the comprehension and production of Galician is likely attributable to several factors, including the language's recent standardization in the 1980s (Pintos, 2025) and the scarcity of databases that would allow for the careful selection of linguistic materials for various experiments. The development of these tools would reinvigorate research on Galician by ensuring that experimental outcomes accurately mirror core cognitive processes. Consequently, they would provide essential scientific evidence to inform public policies related to Galician. This language, which coexists with Spanish, presents a distinctive opportunity to examine psycholinguistic theories of language processing within bilingual contexts.Although we generally adhere to the same data collection and preprocessing procedures described in the MultiPic database (Duñabeitia et al., 2022), several adaptations were necessary to accurately reflect Galician's linguistic reality. These modifications accounted for the linguistic diversity across the region, shaped by the contact between Galician and Spanish. For instance, because Galician remains subordinate to Spanish in many social contexts, speakers often incorporate Spanish words or adapted terms, with variations across different regions (cf. Rei-Doval, 2025). Thus, we considered the diverse linguistic varieties and regional differences within Galician, ensuring that the dataset represents the full spectrum of language use across different areas. This approach not only respects the sociolinguistic context of Galician but also allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive processes involved in bilingual language processing. That is, it will enable researchers to examine which cognitive processes are general and which are specific to different sociolinguistic contexts. Nevertheless, the experimental method, the preprocessing protocol, and the data structure are comprehensively detailed to provide researchers with the necessary framework for adapting the MultiPic to other languages with comparable sociolinguistic contexts.In conclusion, MultiPic and the Galician MultiPic, in particular, serve as valuable tools that enable researchers to design studies in Galician and other languages, where the properties of the materials have been rigorously tested in parallel.The complete dataset, including the data file, is publicly available in the following repositories: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Untitled_Item/19328939 and https://osf.io/ank4g/?view_only=43367d3dd27543b0aa66dfb8e71ce1fc.2 MethodParticipants were recruited over two months through social media and local newspaper advertisements. Their participation was voluntary. A total of 88 Galician speakers were initially recruited, surpassing the median sample size in the original MultiPic project (i.e., 80; Duñabeitia et al., 2022)). Still, three were excluded for not following task instructions (e.g., responding in a language other than Galician or basing answers on familiarity with the picture instead of its name).From the remaining 85 participants (47 women, 34 men, four preferred not to disclose their sex; mean age = 42 [age range of 18 to 82], SD = 19.05), around 28% of participants were from O Grove, 8% from Santiago de Compostela, 8% from A Coruña, 6% from Vigo, and the rest from 24 different places. Even though all were speakers of Galician, in their daily lives, around 28% spoke only Galician, 32% spoke more Galician than Castilian Spanish, 18% spoke both languages equally, 16% spoke more Castilian Spanish than Galician, and 6% spoke only Castilian Spanish. More than half had a university degree.We used the 500 colored pictures from the MultiPic database representing common concrete concepts. These pictures were in PNG format with a 300 × 300 pixels resolution and were initially created by a local artist commissioned by the authors of the original study (Duñabeitia et al., 2018). The set of 500 elements depicted was the same as those used in Duñabeitia et al. (2022), consisting of a pictorial set of digital line drawings derived from a list of imageable and concrete Spanish words taken from ESPAL (Duchon et al., 2013).The Galician MultiPic norming followed the standardized protocol of the original MultiPic project. Instructions were provided in Galician. Sociolinguistic data, including age, gender, number of languages spoken fluently, and possession of a university degree, were collected. However, unlike other languages, the sociolinguistic data for Galician was gathered in greater detail to ensure an accurate understanding of the sociolinguistic reality of the Galician language. Thus, questions were added regarding place of birth and place of residence, age of acquisition of Galician and Spanish, language balance, educational level, and socioeconomic status.Participants received a link and completed the tasks on their computers, tablets, or phones. However, fifteen elderly adults who were not computer literate gave their responses orally, which a team member transcribed. All participants completed the two tasks in the same order using the Gorilla Experiment Builder. First, participants were provided with a link and completed the tasks by typing their responses using a computer, tablet, or smartphone. However, fifteen elderly adults who were not computer literate provided their responses orally, which a team member transcribed. Considering this, all participants named each of the 500 randomly presented images, using no more than one word per concept. Then, they rated their familiarity with each concept on a 100-point scale, ranging from 0 (not familiar at all) to 100 (very familiar). If they did not know the name of an image, they could select the ""?"" button, which was recorded as an ""I don't know"" response. Before starting, participants completed two practice trials to familiarize themselves with the procedure. The experiment lasted approximately one hour, with breaks every 50 trials. Responses were coded to account for linguistic variations, including standard (i.e., the form accepted by the Real Academia Galega [Royal Galician Academy]) versus colloquial forms, dialectal differences, and influences from Spanish. To this end, and following preceding studies (Duñabeitia et al., 2018;2022), a native speaker of Galician reviewed and corrected spelling errors while also standardizing responses by merging basic variants of the same names (e.g., hyphenated or pluralized forms).A version of the Galician MultiPic is also available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Untitled_Item/19328939. However, only the data considering the Galician nouns are provided here, even when the Galician noun was not the modal name (which occurred with 52 nouns [highlighted in yellow in the dataset provided in OSF]). Thus, the Galician MultiPic at Figshare includes nine columns (from A to I) as occurs with the other 33 languages of MultiPic, which corresponds to the Language provided, the Code (number of the picture), the Number of Responses, the H statistic, the Modal Response, the Modal Response Percentage, the ""I don't know"" Response Percentage, the Idiosyncratic Response Percentage, and the Familiarity.Sheet H-STATISTIC contains the calculation of the H-STATISTIC for each picture.Sheet CODEBOOK contains a detailed description of the information collected in both the raw and cleaned data frames used for analyses.Regarding the naming task, two measures were considered as in earlier Multipic studies: the mean H statistic and the mean modal response percentagefoot_0. These were analyzed, and the familiarity measures were recorded as well.The most notable finding is that the data exhibits an averaged H statistic of 0.71 and a mean modal response percentage of 73.56%. As mentioned above, only 52 pictures out of 500 had one unique response. The H statistic for Galician is higher than the average for MultiPic across 33 other languages (0.55). Indeed, only 5 out of 33 languages (Malay, Lebanese, Korean, Mandarin, and Cantonese) have higher H statistic values than Galician, and only 2 (Mandarin and Cantonese) lower mean modal response percentages (73.28% and 59.17%, respectively). Interestingly, of the official languages in the Iberian Peninsula, including Basque, Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, and Castilian Spanish, Galician exhibits the highest H statistic and the lowest mean modal response percentage. In comparison, the H statistic and the mean modal response percentage for Basque are 0.66 and 82.94%, for Catalan 0.45 and 88.98%, for Portuguese 0.37 and 90.38%, and for Castilian Spanish 0.30 and 93%, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the norms for the 500 images of the MultiPic in each of the languages of the Iberian Peninsula. The relatively high mean H statistic and low mean modal response percentages obtained in the current dataset suggest a higher lexical variability when compared to most languages included in the Multipic database and to the languages that coexist in the Iberian Peninsula.Correlation analyses on the H statistic and Familiarity values across languages of the Iberian Peninsula were conducted to validate individual dataset quality. We focus on comparative analyses in these languages because speakers share not only historical and linguistic connections but also cultural and educational influences that shape familiarity judgments. This is particularly relevant for Romance languages like Castilian Spanish, European Portuguese, Catalan, and Galician, which have significant lexical and structural similarities, as well as for Basque, which, despite being non-Romance coexists in the same sociolinguistic environment. While cross-linguistic correlations can occur even between typologically distant languages, as shown in previous studies, our focus here is on a more controlled linguistic and cultural space, allowing for a more precise interpretation of familiarity effects.A correlation analysis performed on the H statistic showed that all the Pearson pairwise correlation coefficients were significant at the p < 0.001 level, with r values ranging between 0.27 (Galician vs. European Portuguese) and 0.59 (Spanish vs. Catalan). The reason why r values between Galician and European Portuguese are the lowest despite their status as closely related languages with a shared medieval history as part of Galician-Portuguese, may be attributed to the distinct sociolinguistic contexts in which they have developed. These differing contexts have played a significant role in shaping lexical variation between the two languages. Note that Galician coexists with Castilian Spanish, a language of high prestige, which has led to the incorporation of numerous lexical borrowings from this language into Galician (see Dubert, 2025). Furthermore, the establishment of an official written standard for Galician did not occur until 1980, highlighting the relatively recent process of linguistic standardization. In contrast, Portuguese is the main language in Portugal and does not coexist with another widely spoken language, except for Mirandese, which is used in the specific region of Miranda do Douro. Additionally, Portuguese has a long-established linguistic tradition, with its first grammar and dictionary dating back to the 16th century. Since these early efforts, a strong normative tradition has been maintained (Santos, 2018).Likewise, the correlation analyses performed on different familiarity scores obtained for each item in each language showed that all the Pearson pairwise correlation coefficients were significant at the p < 0.001 level, with r values ranging between 0.79 (Catalan vs. Basque) and 0.83 (Galician vs. European Portuguese).Besides, a correlation analysis was conducted between the H statistic and Familiarity values in each official or co-official language from the Iberian Peninsula already tested in the MultiPic database. We found low to moderate negative and significant correlations in all of them. That is, the higher the values in familiarity, the lower the values in the H statistic, which makes sense as the higher the H statistic, the lower the name agreement. To be more precise, all Pearson pairwise correlation coefficients were significant at the p < 0.001 level, except for the Galician language ( p =.02), with r values ranging between -.10 (for the Galician) and -.44 (for the Catalan). The smallest correlation was found for Galician. At first, we thought that this was probably because it has greater lexical variability than the other languages. Indeed, if we look at the second language from the Iberian Peninsula that has a high lexical variability (Basque), we can see that it also showed a small correlation value between H statistic and Familiarity (-.25). However, when compared with other languages like Chinese or Malay that also have a great lexical variability we found high significant correlations (-.49 and -.90, respectively). Therefore, a more plausible explanation may lay on the fact that familiarity modulates agreement (and not the other way around). That is, if someone is not familiar (or that much familiar) with an object, they would be hesitant when naming it, and as a consequence, this would lead to lower agreement scores across participants. This would be true for all the languages. However, for Galician more variables than familiarity may be explaining this result such as the already mentioned coexistence with the Castilian language, the recent official written standard for Galician, which means that it is not perfectly implemented, and the desire of some people to reflect their dialectal variant. We recognize, however, that this is a tentative explanation that deserves further examination.Each variable's inter-rater reliability was determined by calculating intraclass correlations (ICCs) via a two-way random consistency model. ICCs revealed acceptable reliability for H statistic (ICC = 0.78 [0.75, 0.81]), and an excellent reliability for familiarity (ICC = 0.92 [0.91, 0.93]).Although all correlations were significant, findings underscore how social and regional factors, such as dialectal variation, hyper-Galician forms, and Spanish influence, shape lexical variation in Galician. A closer look at the responses given to each picture shows that some pictures had multiple interpretations that seem to reflect the variety of realities of the population, i.e., participants used nouns with different meanings (e.g., magnet vs. horseshoe), for example, by using different co-hyponyms or elements of the same semantic field ( figo vs. cebola [fig vs. onion]), or, in some cases, by focusing on different elements or areas of the image (e.g., for the picture of a shoulder, participants used names like costas, pel, or marrón, i.e., back, skin, or brown in English). On the other hand, some pictures were named with synonyms, such as xornal and periódico, two different Galician words to name a newspaper. Importantly, in many cases, the noun participants used depended on the dialectal variety of their region (e.g., vespa, avespa, and avéspora for wasp). Also, in some cases, participants used ""hyper-Galician"" forms, i.e., linguistic forms that are mistakenly created when speakers attempt to use what they perceive as ""correct"" or ""pure"" Galician. People often make these mistakes to avoid the influence of Castilian Spanish, a tendency shaped by the unique context of language contact and the relatively late standardization of Galician in Galicia, as previously mentioned. For example, the correct Galician form for banana is plátano, but the hyper-Galician form prátano is sometimes used. Similarly, many examples of lexical transfers from Spanish can be observed, such as the Spanish word for cheese, queso or for elbow, codo. In fact, in more than 10% of the images (52 cases), the modal form is either the Spanish word (e.g., destornillador [screwdriver] or vela [candle]) or the adapted Spanish word (e.g., xaula [ cage and jaula in English and Spanish, respectively] or paiaso [ clown and payaso in English and Spanish, respectively]).One may think, however, that the lexical variability observed in Galician is driven by the pictures rather than by the particularities of the language itself, as an anonymous reviewer pointed out. In other words, the same concepts consistently exhibit the lowest agreement across languages. This does not seem to be the case since when calculating the mean H statistic of the Multipic database including all the languages tested thus far (33), this was 0.56 (standard deviation = 0.60) and the mean modal response percentage was 85.5% (standard deviation = 17.8). These values are similar to those provided in earlier studies with different sets of stimuli (e.g., Alario et al., 1999;Barry et al., 1997;Bonin et al., 2013;Dimitropoulou et al., 2009;Manoiloff et al., 2010;Rossion et al., 2004), and thus, as Duñabeitia et al. (2022) have already pointed out when comparing the data of 32 languages, ""the relatively low mean H statistic and the high mean modal response percentages of the current dataset suggest high name agreement across items, languages, and varieties, validating the materials for their use in different kinds of experiments and tests"" (p. 4).Despite these contributions, challenges remain. The concentration of data from specific regions and the written modality of the experiment raise questions about representativeness and generalizability. Due to the relatively recent standardization of the Galician language, many speakers are unfamiliar with the correct spelling or form. This raises questions about the challenges of conducting this task in a written format. Nevertheless, this work underscores the importance of comprehensive planning and cultural awareness when developing multilingual resources. Moving forward, the Galician MultiPic offers valuable insights for cross-linguistic studies and bilingualism research, promoting recognition of linguistic diversity while providing a robust framework for future adaptations in other minority languages.3The Galician adaptation of MultiPic fills a critical gap in psycholinguistic research by providing standardized norms for an underrepresented language. This resource highlights the rich lexical variation in Galician, shaped by regional diversity, bilingualism, and language contact with Spanish.Although issues like regional representation and modality (since Multipic is a written rather than spoken task) remain, the Galician MultiPic is an essential tool for cross-linguistic studies and the exploration of bilingual cognitive processes, offering valuable insights for future research on minority language varieties.","['Variation (astronomy)', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Natural language processing', 'Computer

"A comparison of word humor ratings across speakers of North American, British, and Singapore English",2024,10.31234/osf.io/sz8pa,,Cynthia S. Q. Siew,"Large-scale collection of lexical-semantic norms for words in a given language has been instrumental in the progress of psycholinguistic research. However, such norms tend to be collected from speakers of the dominant variant or dialect. This research aims to determine if there may be differences across speakers of various dialects of English in the humor of individual words. Engelthaler and Hills (2018) observed that their humor ratings were most strongly correlated with inverse word frequency: Less frequent words tended to be rated as more humorous. We hypothesized that words that are less frequently occurring in a given English dialect should be perceived as more humorous by speakers of the same dialect. We selected words of relatively higher and lower frequencies across various corpora of North American, British, or Singapore English, and presented these words to participants who were native English speakers of North American, British, or Singapore English. Study 1 compared humor ratings of North Americans and Singaporeans; Study 2 compared humor ratings of North Americans and the British. Analyses of participants’ random slope coefficients of frequency extracted from cumulative link mixed-effects models indicated that humor ratings were more strongly (and inversely) associated with the word’s frequency in the corpora that aligned with the rater’s English dialect. These results provide evidence that people are sensitive to the statistics of their specific language environment, and importantly suggest that creators of lexical-semantic norm databases should consider how the cultural, historical, or sociopolitical context of raters might influence the nature of their ratings.","['Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Word (group theory)', 'British English', 'American English', 'History', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4396808807,True,0,10.31234/osf.io/sz8pa,linguistics psychology word group theory british english american english history philosophy comparison word humor ratings speakers north american british singapore english large scale collection lexical semantic norms words given language instrumental progress psycholinguistic research norms tend collected speakers dominant variant dialect research aims determine differences speakers various dialects english humor individual words engelthaler hills observed humor ratings strongly correlated inverse word frequency frequent words tended rated humorous hypothesized words frequently occurring given english dialect perceived humorous speakers dialect selected words relatively higher lower frequencies various corpora north american british singapore english presented words participants native english speakers north american british singapore english study compared humor ratings north americans singaporeans study compared humor ratings north americans british analyses participants random slope coefficients frequency extracted cumulative link mixed effects models indicated humor ratings strongly inversely associated words frequency corpora aligned raters english dialect results provide evidence people sensitive statistics specific language environment importantly suggest creators lexical semantic norm databases consider cultural historical sociopolitical context raters influence nature ratings,1

In the field of Japanese word recognition, a large-scale database that would enable mega-study approaches has not been well-established. In this study, we developed an AoA norm for over 5,000 Japanese words. A total of 1,345 adults rated the AoA of 5,736 words using a 7-point scale. These ratings demonstrated satisfactory reliability.

Affective and Psycholinguistic Norms for 1200 Two‐character Chinese Words,2025,10.1111/ijal.12829,International Journal of Applied Linguistics,Jia Liu; Lin Fan; Xiao-kun Zhang; Zeming Xu,"ABSTRACT The interplay between emotion and language has drawn increasing attention from researchers in various fields, such as psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, and artificial intelligence. The classification of emotional words is crucial to experimental studies, as it serves as a fundamental step for unveiling the complex relationship between emotion and language. Hence, the current study introduces affective and psycholinguistic norms for 1200 two‐character Chinese words. The affective variables, including emotional prototypicality (EmoPro), valence, and arousal, as well as psycholinguistic variables (abstractness and familiarity), were rated by native speakers of Chinese using a 7‐point Likert scale. This set of norms, as far as we know, is the first one that provides words’ EmoPro together with other affective and psycholinguistic variables rated by the same group of participants. The results of inter‐rater reliability and correlation tests showed that this set of norms had good reliability and validity. The correlation between EmoPro and arousal was significant and strong. Valence and arousal exhibited an asymmetric U‐shaped relationship, with negative words being rated higher in arousal than positive ones. We also identified a quadratic relationship between EmoPro and valence, indicating that more prototypical emotion‐label words tend to trigger more extreme valence ratings. EmoPro significantly and positively correlated with abstractness, indicating that prototypical emotion‐label words tend to be more abstract. In addition, familiarity and word frequency predict lexical decision performance, whereas EmoPro does not after controlling for other variables. The present set of Chinese norms supports material selection in experimental research, enables cross‐linguistic comparisons, and has potential applications in natural language processing.","['Character (mathematics)', 'Psychology', 'Linguistics', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'Geometry']",https://openalex.org/W4412827153,False,0,10.1111/ijal.12829,character mathematics psychology linguistics cognitive psychology philosophy mathematics geometry affective psycholinguistic norms twocharacter chinese words abstract interplay emotion language drawn increasing attention researchers various fields psycholinguistics neurolinguistics artificial intelligence classification emotional words crucial experimental studies serves fundamental step unveiling complex relationship emotion language current study introduces affective psycholinguistic norms twocharacter chinese words affective variables including emotional prototypicality emopro valence arousal psycholinguistic variables abstractness familiarity rated native speakers chinese using point likert scale set norms far know provides words emopro affective psycholinguistic variables rated group participants results interrater reliability correlation tests showed set norms good reliability validity correlation emopro arousal significant strong valence arousal exhibited asymmetric ushaped relationship negative words rated higher arousal positive ones identified quadratic relationship emopro valence indicating prototypical emotionlabel words tend trigger extreme valence ratings emopro significantly positively correlated abstractness indicating prototypical emotionlabel words tend abstract addition familiarity word frequency predict lexical decision performance emopro does controlling variables present set chinese norms supports material selection experimental research enables crosslinguistic comparisons potential applications natural language processing,1
Functioning of Interferemas and Russianisms in the Texts of Internet Editions,2021,10.31548/philolog2021.04.017,Mìžnarodnij fìlologìčnij časopis,O Tepla,"Introduction. Researchers of media discourse, along with the positive aspects of the development of modern Ukrainian literary language in the media, point to the decline of media speech culture. The purpose of the article is to record examples of Russification and language negligence in online publications, to provide practical recommendations for improving the speech culture of journalists. Results. Interferems and Russianisms in online mass media are studied. The source base of the study was journalistic texts of online publications of national and regional significance (""Ukrainian Truth"", ""Doba"").The analysis of the revealed deviations from lexical norm is carried out, the basic erroneously dangerous places are specified. It is proved that a common type of lexical errors in the language of the media - interferems and Russianisms. According to the classification of interference, in the analyzed online publications can be divided into two groups of such non-normative units. The first group includes single tokens-interferems. They form a small system of representatives. The second group of formations of interferomic character consists of non-normative combinations of several tokens. In the process of linguistic examination of journalistic materials, non-normative tokens-Russianisms (a word or phrase borrowed from the Russian language or built on the model of Russian words and expressions) were revealed. The inappropriateness of using nouns with the suffix -k- to denote an action in appropriate contexts is characterized, instead the analyzed materials distribute such formations. A number of extra- and intralinguistic factors have been identified, which have led to the spread of Ukrainian Russian-language interference elements in speech. The main extralinguistic reasons are the following: living in Ukraine a significant number of people who only understand the Ukrainian language, but do not speak it; knowledge of the majority of Ukrainian citizens in both languages - Ukrainian and Russian; improper knowledge of Ukrainian speakers of its norms; poor vocabulary of speakers; imperfect language policy in the state; lack of an effective mechanism for implementing the Law on Languages. The main intralinguistic factors are the typological affinity of the East Slavic languages and the formal (sound-letter) similarity of a large part of the Ukrainian and Russian lexicons. Results. Thus, online publications, both national and regional, are characterized by a low degree of language competence. In particular, activity in the use of interference tokens and Russian tokens has been demonstrated.","['Ukrainian', 'Linguistics', 'Normative', 'Lexis', 'Computer science', 'Point (geometry)', 'Standard language', 'Suffix', 'Phrase', 'Sociology', 'Political science', 'Law', 'Mathematics', 'Philosophy', 'Geometry']",https://openalex.org/W4200557146,True,0,10.31548/philolog2021.04.017,ukrainian linguistics normative lexis computer science point geometry standard language suffix phrase sociology political science law mathematics philosophy geometry functioning interferemas russianisms texts internet editions introduction researchers media discourse positive aspects development modern ukrainian literary language media point decline media speech culture purpose article record examples russification language negligence online publications provide practical recommendations improving speech culture journalists results interferems russianisms online mass media studied source base study journalistic texts online publications national regional significance ukrainian truth doba analysis revealed deviations lexical norm carried basic erroneously dangerous places specified proved common type lexical errors language media interferems russianisms according classification interference analyzed online publications divided groups non normative units group includes single tokens interferems form small representatives second group formations interferomic character consists non normative combinations tokens process linguistic examination journalistic materials non normative tokens russianisms word phrase borrowed russian language built model russian words expressions revealed inappropriateness using nouns suffix k denote action appropriate contexts characterized instead analyzed materials distribute formations number extra intralinguistic factors identified led spread ukrainian russian language interference elements speech main extralinguistic reasons following living ukraine significant number people understand ukrainian language speak knowledge majority ukrainian citizens languages ukrainian russian improper knowledge ukrainian speakers norms poor vocabulary speakers imperfect language policy state lack effective mechanism implementing law languages main intralinguistic factors typological affinity east slavic languages formal sound letter similarity large ukrainian russian lexicons results online publications national regional characterized low degree language competence particular activity use interference tokens russian tokens demonstrated,1
Integration and adaptation of English loan words in the Ukrainian language,2022,10.12958/2227-2631-2021-1-45-119-127,Linguistics,Вікторія Опанасенко,"The article is devoted to the study of the process of borrowing and adaptation of English loan words in the Ukrainian language. It is established that in the lexical system of the Ukrainian language foreign words make up about 10%, 70 – 80% of which are English loan words. The presence of a significant share of English loan words in the Ukrainian language is due to a number of extra- and intralinguistic factors: the development of economic, cultural and political ties; quantitative and qualitative complication of various spheres of language communication; diversity of norms of speech behavior; expansion of regulatory limits; achievements of English-speaking countries in certain fields of activity; striving for linguistic economy; the need to replenish the composition of expressive language means; the need to clarify and detail the concepts available in the language; «Americanization»; imitation of fashion. The study systematizes English loan words in the Ukrainian language and distributes them by spheres of use (sociopolitical, financial and economic, culture and art, technical, mass communication, sports, science, and education). Three stages in the process of adaptation of English loan words into the Ukrainian language are distinguished: 1) the initial stage, which is characterized by a change in the morpheme structure of English loan words; 2) in-depth, related to the selection of the same components in groups of English loan words based on the similarity of final elements and the development of new suffixes of English origin in the Ukrainian language; 3) the stage of full adaptation, which is characterized by participation of English loan words in the process of word formation through the mediation of Ukrainian language suffixes, the formation of new complex words based on English loan words and Ukrainian or previously borrowed words, as well as the consolidation of the spelling form of complex words. It is established that the inclusion of English loan words in the lexical structure of the Ukrainian language and their active use in oral and written speech leads to the formation of synonymous pairs containing proper Ukrainian counterparts.","['Ukrainian', 'Loan', 'Linguistics', 'Sociology', 'Business', 'Finance', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4296229202,True,0,10.12958/2227-2631-2021-1-45-119-127,ukrainian loan linguistics sociology business finance philosophy integration adaptation english loan words ukrainian language article devoted study process borrowing adaptation english loan words ukrainian language established lexical ukrainian language foreign words make english loan words presence significant share english loan words ukrainian language number extra intralinguistic factors development economic cultural political ties quantitative qualitative complication various spheres language communication diversity norms speech behavior expansion regulatory limits achievements english speaking countries certain fields activity striving linguistic economy need replenish composition expressive language means need clarify concepts available language americanization imitation fashion study systematizes english loan words ukrainian language distributes spheres use sociopolitical financial economic culture art technical mass communication sports science education stages process adaptation english loan words ukrainian language distinguished initial stage characterized change morpheme structure english loan words depth related selection components groups english loan words based similarity final elements development new suffixes english origin ukrainian language stage adaptation characterized participation english loan words process word formation mediation ukrainian language suffixes formation new complex words based english loan words ukrainian previously borrowed words consolidation spelling form complex words established inclusion english loan words lexical structure ukrainian language active use oral written speech leads formation synonymous pairs containing proper ukrainian counterparts,1

Mean ratings were then computed, with a high interrater reliability and interitem consistency. Based on the three modalities, each word also features a specific modality exclusivity, and a dominant modality. The norms also include external measures of word frequency, length, distinctiveness, age of acquisition, and known percentage. Starting with the results, unimodal, bimodal, and tri-modal words appear. Visual and haptic experience are quite related, leaving a more independent auditory experience. These different relations are important because they may correlate with different levels of detail in word comprehension (Louwerse &amp; Connell, 2011). Auditory and visual words tend towards unimodality, whereas haptic words tend towards multimodality. Likewise, properties are more unimodal than concepts. The form of words is not quite as arbitrary as we used to think. It is connected to their meaning.

The study of these monuments written in the Turkish language, and the study of their phonetic, lexical, and grammatical features also create conditions for determining the literary norms of the Turkic languages. From this point of view, the analysis of the vocabulary of “Jamshid and Khurshid”, a Turkish language written monument of the 14th-15th centuries, is both important and interesting from the point of view of studying the existence of Turkic words.In this article, the lexicon of Turkic origin has been studied in the language of Ahmadi’s masnavi “Jamshid and Khurshid”, the words of Turkic origin involved in the research have been compared with their usage forms in modern Turkic languages. As a result of the research, it has been found out that there are enough words of Turkic origin among the nouns, verbs, and numeral words used in the language of the monument. However, in the lexicon of “Jamshid and Khurshid” verbs occupy a greater place among the words of Turkic origin. In the lexicon of the 14th-15th century written monument “Jamshid and Khurshid”, carrying the linguistic features of Anatolian Oghuz Turkic, some of the words of Turkic origin have been preserved with minor phonetic changes, and some have been preserved their functionality as they are in modern Turkic languages.","['Lexicon', 'Turkish', 'Linguistics', 'Vocabulary', 'Etymology', 'History', 'Noun', 'Numeral system', 'Point (geometry)', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Mathematics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Geometry']",https://openalex.org/W4327799707,True,0,10.37547/ot/vol-01issue-02-07,lexicon turkish linguistics vocabulary etymology history noun numeral point geometry computer science philosophy mathematics artificial intelligence geometry lexicon turkic origin jamshid khurshid masnavis language point view studying centuries old history turkish language language monuments created turkish poets writers middle ages important sources study monuments written turkish language study phonetic lexical grammatical features create conditions determining literary norms turkic languages point view analysis vocabulary jamshid khurshid turkish language written monument th th centuries important interesting point view studying existence turkic words article lexicon turkic origin studied language ahmadis masnavi jamshid khurshid words turkic origin involved research compared usage forms modern turkic languages result research words turkic origin nouns verbs numeral words used language monument lexicon jamshid khurshid verbs occupy greater place words turkic origin lexicon th th century written monument jamshid khurshid carrying linguistic features anatolian oghuz turkic words turkic origin preserved minor phonetic changes preserved functionality modern turkic languages,1
"Semantic gender: Norms for 24,000 Dutch words and its role in word meaning",2022,10.31234/osf.io/tske8,,Hendrik Vankrunkelsven; Yang Yang; Marc Brysbaert; Simon De Deyne; Gert Storms,"Semantic gender norms are presented for 24,037 Dutch words. Eighty participants rated 6,017 words each on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from feminine to masculine. Each word was rated by 10 male and 10 female participants. The collected norms show high reliability and correlate well with similar norms in English.

Europeanisms are sufficiently represented in the modern medical, economic, political, military, household, educational, digital media-discourse und cyber-discourse. It was found that the most active processes of word formation occur in the modern European media-discourse. Common methods of word formation of Europeanisms are affixation, compounding, contamination, and contraction. The negative ideological connotation of new eponymous pejoratives formed from the surnames of modern political leaders, and of new Europeanisms-exoethnonyms was revealed. The given European eponyms and exoethnonyms acquire an emotional and evaluative color with additional connotative meaning. By several similar examples of Europeanisms in diverse discourses it is qualified that English is the most important donor language for them.

How do we feel about borrowed words? Affective and lexico-semantic norms for most frequent unadapted English loanwords in Croatian (ENGRI CROWD),2024,10.1177/13670069241280355,International Journal of Bilingualism,Irena Bogunović; Bojana Ćoso; Marc Guasch; Eva Pavlinušić Vilus; Pilar Ferré; José Antonio Hinojosa,"Aims and objectives: English has become the dominant donor language for many languages, including Croatian. Perception of English loanwords has mainly been investigated through corpus-based studies or attitude questionnaires. At the same time, normative data for unadapted English loanwords are still mainly unavailable. This study aims to fill that gap by collecting affective and lexico-semantic norms for unadapted English loanwords in Croatian. Methodology: Valence, arousal, familiarity, and concreteness ratings for unadapted English loanwords and three types of Croatian equivalents were collected from 565 participants. Data and analysis: Affective and lexico-semantic norms for each word on the four variables are available in the database. In addition, the relationship between different variables was examined. Finally, the differences between English loanwords and three types of Croatian equivalents (in-context, out-of-context, and adapted forms) are reported. Findings: Valence ratings for unadapted English loanwords differed from out-of-context equivalents and adapted forms. Unadapted English loanwords were rated as more arousing than Croatian equivalents. Finally, unadapted English loanwords were less familiar and less concrete than in-context and out-of-context equivalents. The findings suggest that Croatian speakers perceive unadapted English loanwords differently on affective and lexico-semantic levels compared with Croatian equivalents. Originality: This is the first study to provide affective and lexical norms for 391 most frequent unadapted English loanwords in Croatian.

Words can only get us so far,2024,10.1558/jmtp.23701,Journal of Multilingual Theories and Practices,Manuel F. Pulido,"The traditional ontological division between the lexicon and grammar has often resulted in a reductionist view of the lexicon and lexical competence as composed of individual words in isolation. This narrow view of the lexicon has transcended disciplinary boundaries and is apparent in the focus on single words of widely used psycholinguistic measures of language (e.g. picture naming, verbal fluency, lexical decision) and cognitive ability alike (e.g. Stroop, recall in working memory span). This article argues that such an approach has imposed limitations on the questions that can be examined by researchers and on the generalizability of some results. Here I propose that, rather than assigning multiword units their own ‘niche’ in psycholinguistic studies, they should be viewed as part of the way core lexical competence is measured and conceptualized, both in monolingual and bilingual speakers. I also review promising advances in recent years brought about by a surge in the number of studies focused on multiword units and by new tasks of individual cognitive skill (e.g. multiword-based chunking ability).

"Measuring perceptual and emotive dimensions of multi-word expressions: Can concreteness, emotional valence, and arousal be well estimated by some simple function of the constituent word ratings?",2019,10.6084/m9.figshare.7560422,Figshare,Seth Lindstromberg,"Abstract: Subjective ratings of dimensions of lexical meaning have long been used in experimental psychology and psycholinguistics―for example, in experimental studies of memory, lexical processing, and brain function. Three such dimensions of lexical meaning are concreteness (vs abstractness), emotional valence (degree of pleasantness), and arousal (degree of excitement). Ratings have typically been obtained by presenting lexical items to multiple respondents who rate each item on a Likert scale, after which the ratings for each item are averaged. For some dimensions of meaning and for some languages, ratings of many thousands of single words are freely available; but even for English there are as yet no remotely similar-size collections of ratings for multiword expressions (MWEs), such as collocations and spaced compound nouns. Researchers, including researchers of L2 vocabulary acquisition, may therefore wonder how well a MWE’s level of concreteness, valence or arousal can be estimated from the ratings of its constituent words. This article reports a study which addressed that question, concluding that MWE ratings derived from constituent word ratings must be used with caution. The study has doubled the e)xisting small stock of English MWEs rated for arousal and valence. The data: The spreadsheet relates to seven correlational studies of which five concern concreteness and one each concern valence and arousal. The focal data in each substudy consist of a column of subjective ratings of (a) MWEs as wholes and (b) mean ratings, i.e., (rating of word 1 + rating of word 2) / 2.The concreteness ratings mostly come from Brysbaert, Warriner, and Kuperman (2014) although for study two some of the word ratings come from the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart, 1981; Wilson, 1988). The great majority of the MWE ratings of valence and arousal were collected by me through Amazon Mechanical Turk; some stem from Warriner, Kuperman, and Brysbaert (2013). All the word ratings stem from Warriner et al. An additional crucial variable in one study (Study 6, Valence) is the valence rating of the most-valenced constituent word--i.e., the word whole rating departs most in either direction from neutral, which is 5 on the 9-point Likert scale of the valence and arousal ratings. The concreteness ratings are on a 5-point scale. Among the data for valence and arousal are ratings for items for which WKB and AMT ratings are available. Correlations between these WKB and AMT items furnish some degree of validation.

"Reward as a facet of word meaning: Ratings of motivation for 8,601 English words",2025,10.3758/s13428-025-02762-8,Behavior Research Methods,Doina-Irina Giurgea; Penny M. Pexman; Richard J. Binney,"Abstract Semantic representations arise from a distillation of multiple sources of information, including sensory, motor, affective, interoceptive, linguistic and cognitive experience. Experience of reward is a highly salient aspect of many human activities, and yet its contribution to semantic processing is not well understood. To address this, the present study took a psycholinguistic approach to measuring and evaluating associations with reward as a facet of word meaning. Behavioural and neurophysiological data suggest that reward processing involves multiple stages and mechanisms. For instance, systems associated with the experience and anticipation of pleasure in response to a reward appear distinct from motivational processes that underlie the pursuit of a stimulus. We sought to collect a novel set of word ratings that capture the full extent of reward-related experience. Initial explorations revealed that reward/pleasure ratings are highly correlated with existing norms of emotional valence. Ratings of association with motivation, however, were only moderately correlated with valence, suggesting they capture distinct semantic information. We therefore conducted a preregistered large-scale study to obtain motivation ratings for 8,601 words. Our analyses suggest these ratings capture aspects of word meaning which are distinct from other semantic dimensions, such as concreteness and valence. Moreover, they explain unique variance in participant performance on lexical, semantic, and recognition memory tasks. We combined motivation and emotional valence ratings to provide a composite measure that might approximate a more general ‘reward’ construct. However, this did not explain additional variance compared to the individual variables. We discuss the implications of these results for neurocognitive theories of semantics.","['Psychology', 'Concreteness', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Valence (chemistry)', 'Pleasure', 'Semantic memory', 'Cognition', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience']",https://openalex.org/W4412784629,True,0,10.3758/s13428-025-02762-8,psychology concreteness cognitive psychology valence chemistry pleasure semantic memory cognition physics quantum mechanics neuroscience reward facet word meaning ratings motivation english words abstract semantic representations arise distillation multiple sources information including sensory motor affective interoceptive linguistic cognitive experience experience reward highly salient aspect human activities contribution semantic processing understood address present study took psycholinguistic approach measuring evaluating associations reward facet word meaning behavioural neurophysiological data suggest reward processing involves multiple stages mechanisms instance systems associated experience anticipation pleasure response reward appear distinct motivational processes underlie pursuit stimulus sought collect novel set word ratings capture extent reward related experience initial explorations revealed reward pleasure ratings highly correlated existing norms emotional valence ratings association motivation moderately correlated valence suggesting capture distinct semantic information conducted preregistered large scale study obtain motivation ratings words analyses suggest ratings capture aspects word meaning distinct semantic dimensions concreteness valence explain unique variance participant performance lexical semantic recognition memory tasks combined motivation emotional valence ratings provide composite measure approximate general reward construct did explain additional variance compared individual variables discuss implications results neurocognitive theories semantics,1

Nevertheless, this is not a free-for-all which is far beyond restrictions or exceptions. Some constraints are not imposed to deviate from the metrical norms of Iraqi words nor some exceptions are made to distort their lexical frames, but rather they are adopted to emphasize that any theory's premises are generally the same but its applicable ends are definitely different in so far as the language or the dialect in question is concerned.

What can emotion and abstract words tell us about context availability ratings?,2025,10.1075/ml.24013.mas,The Mental Lexicon,Catherine Mason; Solène Hameau; Lyndsey Nickels,"Abstract Semantic dimensions such as context availability, imageability and valence, form core components of many theoretical accounts of lexical processing. Typically, normative data for such semantic dimensions are drawn from subjective ratings, however, questions have been raised regarding the reliability and validity of these ratings. In this paper, we discuss this issue with a focus on context availability norms. Using data collected for another study, we show that context availability ratings required significantly higher rates of data exclusions at the level of both participants and items compared to other variables. In addition, high standard deviations at the item level, indicated a substantial degree of disagreement between participants. This suggested that some participants may have had difficulty understanding the concept of context availability which hindered their ability to complete the ratings. We provide recommendations for future research focusing on context availability and for norm collection procedures more broadly in order that the validity of such norms can be improved.

We use YouTube subtitles to construct frequency norms for five diverse languages, Chinese, English, Indonesian, Japanese, and Spanish, and evaluate their correlation with lexical decision time, word familiarity, and lexical complexity.

Can word frequency norms based on small spoken corpora compete with norms based on popular written corpora?,2019,10.1121/1.5137569,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,H. V. Abrahamyan,"Current word frequency norms used in speech research are based on written corpora. Recently, Brysbaert and New (2009) presented newer frequency counts based on larger corpus of film and television subtitles, on the idea that these would more closely approximate actual spoken frequencies. Although Brysbaert and New (2009) showed that their frequencies significantly better predict visual reaction time data, they still used corpora with text that was originally written and perhaps heavily edited. In general, most speech researchers prefer using norms from a larger written corpora as norms from spoken corpora are often based on smaller number of tokens (i.e., less then one million). However, many studies use only a small subset of words, frequencies for which may not benefit from a large corpus. Furthermore, many studies dichotomize words into high- and low-frequency groups, thus rendering fine distinctions between frequencies of words computed using a large corpus potentially less useful.

The article discusses whether it is justified to include in the academic dictionaries’ lexical units of substandard vocabulary — units of colloquial speech, vernacular, jargon, slang, etc. At different times, the authors of academic dictionaries were reproached (and are reproached today) for excessive democracy: according to critics, the normative dictionary should reflect strictly standard norm, the description of the substandard vocabulary in the normative dictionary is unacceptable. The problem mentioned above is studied on the material of two dictionaries — the Academic Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian Language and the Academic Russian Orthographic Dictionary.

Analyses of stylistic marks “colloquial” and “vernacular” in academic explanatory dictionaries shows that, in addition to these characteristics, lexicographers were also guided by some implicit criteria, such as: 1) figurative (metaphorical, metonymic); 2) emotional-evaluative connotation; 3) presence of the word neutral lexical equivalent.

Italian norms and naming latencies for 357 high quality color images,2018,10.1101/492256,bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory),Eduardo Navarrete; Giorgio Arcara; Sara Mondini; Barbara Penolazzi,"In the domain of cognitive studies on the lexico-semantic representational system, one of the most important means of ensuring well-suited experimental designs is using ecological stimulus sets accompanied by normative data on the most relevant variables affecting the processing of their items. In the context of image sets, color photographs are particularly suited for this aim as they reduce the difficulty of visual decoding processes that may emerge with traditional image sets of line drawings, especially in clinical populations. We provide Italian norms for a set of 357 high quality image-items belonging to 23 semantic subcategories. Data from several variables affecting image processing: age of acquisition, familiarity, lexical frequency, manipulability, name agreement, typicality and visual complexity; were collected from a sample of 255 Italian-speaking participants. Lexical frequency data were derived from the CoLFIS corpus. Furthermore, we collected data with on image naming latencies aimed at exploring how much of the variance in these latencies could be explained by the above mentioned critical variables. Multiple regression analyses on the naming latencies show classical psycholinguistic phenomena, such as the effects of age of acquisition and name agreement. In addition, manipulability is also a significant predictor.

Unveiling the intensity–ambiguity relationships among affective and lexico-semantic variables in Chinese characters and the character–word relationships in Chinese two-character words,2025,10.3758/s13428-025-02753-9,Behavior Research Methods,Xi Cheng; Chi‐Shing Tse; Yuen‐Lai Chan; Kai Yan Lau; Yen Na Yum,"Abstract Understanding the lexical characteristics of Chinese characters is crucial given their extensive usage and unique logographic structure. In this study, we normed affective ratings (valence and arousal) for 3971 Chinese characters. We investigated the relationships between intensity (mean rating) and ambiguity (rating variability) of these affective variables, alongside additional lexico-semantic variables from Su et al., Behavior Research Methods, 55 (6), 2989–3008, (2022). Drawing on lexical data from 25,281 two-character words available in the Chinese Lexicon Project (Tse et al., Behavior Research Methods, 49 (4), 1503–1519, 2017, Behavior Research Methods, 55 (8), 4382–4402, 2023; Chan &amp; Tse, Behavior Research Methods, 56 (7), 7574–7601, 2024), we further explored cross-level relationships between character-level and word-level variables. Multiple regression analyses controlling for various lexical variables revealed several noteworthy patterns. First, we identified a quadratic valence–arousal relationship, such that characters with extreme valence ratings (either highly positive or highly negative) elicited higher arousal compared to neutral characters. This relationship was moderated by arousal ambiguity, partially consistent with previous findings (Brainerd et al. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 150 (8), 1476–1499, 2021a), Second, we observed consistent quadratic intensity–ambiguity relationships across all variables, supporting the quadratic law proposed by Brainerd et al. Journal of Memory and Language, 121, 104286, (2021b). Finally, significant positive associations occurred between character-level variables and their corresponding word-level variables for both the first and second characters. The strength of these cross-level relationships varied across affective and lexico-semantic variables and may further be influenced by semantic transparency. Overall, our findings advance the understanding of affective and semantic features of Chinese characters and offer insights into the cross-level integration of characters’ and words’ lexical characteristics.

Many Pakistani linguists have discussed unique consonantal and vocalic features of Pakistani English (PakE). However, there has not been any significant research conducted on the pronunciation of English velar nasal or angma /ŋ/ by Pakistani English speakers. This study analyses the pronunciation of English velar nasal by Pakistani English speakers. The sample was selected from 20 undergraduate students of the Department of English studying in the first semester of a large-scale public sector university located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. A number of 20 English lexical items were selected and were divided into three categories according to the distribution of angma in the English language. The items were presented to the participants in diagnostic sentences. PRAAT, the speech and phonetics analysis software, was used to analyse the data. The findings revealed that Pakistani English speakers pronounce angma inaccurately in the medial position and insert velar plosive /ɡ/ in the poly-morphemic words. However, in the final position, angma is pronounced correctly by most Pakistani English speakers. The findings highlight that Pakistani English speakers are not concerned about the morpheme boundary and pronounce angma without /ŋɡ/ coalescence.

The results reveal a blend of two stress systems — inner circle and distinctive NigE — with a slight preference for the inner-circle stress norms. Syllable weight and affix type were found to significantly influence stress placement.

The explanatory dictionary provides for the systematization information related to cultural and material wealth in a certain order in the content of both widely used and rarely used words. An explanatory is a type of dictionary that systematizes the vocabulary of a particular language and reveals its meanings. In many words, especially in stable phrases, their meanings accumulate information related to culture, worldview, history, and traditional economics of the nation. Such information contained in the word is disclosed in the explanatory note and clarified with illustrative material. Giving an example is one of the requirements for creating an explanatory dictionary because the examples given in the explanatory dictionary are additional illustrative material, which determines the origin of capital words, their stylistic and semantic, grammatical features. The quoted materials in the dictionary entry prove that the word exists or once existed.

Russian and Serbian Punctuation of the 21st Century: An Attempt at Comparative Description,2024,10.25205/1818-7919-2024-23-9-53-68,Vestnik NSU Series History and Philology,Igor E. Kim; M. A. Eliseeva,"Purpose. The authors conducted a comparative study of the general statistical characteristics of modern Russian and Serbian punctuation practice using the material of Internet texts from the early 20s of the 21 st century. Results. The authors analyzed three important characteristics of punctuation practice: the composition and frequency of punctuation situations, the lexical indicators of syntactic relations used (conjunctions, particles, introductory words, etc.), and the occurrence of punctuation marks. The Russian and Serbian parts of the sample are balanced in terms of the number of uses of punctuation marks and in terms of their focus/lack of focus on compliance with the norm on the Internet platforms provided to the authors of the texts. The comparative study revealed similarities and differences in all analyzed parameters. Conclusion. It was found that the high degree of similarity of the main indicators caused by the kinship and typological similarity of the languages is combined with obvious differences, including different occurrence of punctuation situations in graphic practice, different composition and different activity of formal indicators of syntactic connection, different density of punctuation marks per punctuation situation. This means that a comparative study of punctuation practice taking into account statistical data allows us to identify the real relationship between the two punctuation systems, rather than the relationship set by normative documents.","['Serbian', 'Punctuation', 'Linguistics', 'Political science', 'History', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4404229090,True,0,10.25205/1818-7919-2024-23-9-53-68,serbian punctuation linguistics political science history philosophy russian serbian punctuation st century attempt comparative description purpose authors conducted comparative study general statistical characteristics modern russian serbian punctuation practice using material internet texts early s st century results authors analyzed important characteristics punctuation practice composition frequency punctuation situations lexical indicators syntactic relations used conjunctions particles introductory words occurrence punctuation marks russian serbian parts sample balanced terms number uses punctuation marks terms focus lack focus compliance norm internet platforms provided authors texts comparative study revealed similarities differences analyzed parameters conclusion high degree similarity main indicators caused kinship typological similarity languages combined obvious differences including different occurrence punctuation situations graphic practice different composition different activity formal indicators syntactic connection different density punctuation marks punctuation situation means comparative study punctuation practice taking account statistical data allows identify real relationship punctuation systems relationship set normative documents,1

"Perception of Emotion Across Cultures: Norms of Valence, Arousal, and Sensory Experience for 4,923 Chinese Words Translated from English in Warriner et al.

To explore cross-cultural differences in the perception of emotion between Chinese and English speakers, this study collected norms of valence and arousal from 322 native Mandarin speakers for 4,923 Chinese words translated from Warriner et al. (2013). Additionally, sensory experience ratings for each word were collected. Analysis demonstrated that the reliability of this dataset is satisfactory, as indicated by comparisons with previous datasets. We examined the distributions of valence and arousal for the entire dataset, as well as for positive and negative emotion categories. Further analysis suggested that valence, arousal, and sensory experience correlated with various psycholinguistic variables, including the number of syllables, number of strokes, imageability, familiarity, concreteness, frequency, and age of acquisition. Cross-language comparison indicated that native speakers of Chinese and English differ in their perception of emotional valence and arousal, largely due to cross- cultural variations associated with ecological, sociopolitical, and religious factors. This dataset will be a valuable resource for research examining the impact of emotional and sensory information on Chinese lexical processing, as well as for bilingual research investigating the interplay between language and emotion across different cultural contexts.","['Valence (chemistry)', 'Psychology', 'Arousal', 'Perception', 'Embodied cognition', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Mandarin Chinese', 'Linguistics', 'Social psychology', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Neuroscience', 'Artificial intelligence']",https://openalex.org/W4405177917,True,0,10.31219/osf.io/vwpx5,valence chemistry psychology arousal perception embodied cognition cognitive psychology mandarin chinese linguistics social psychology computer science philosophy physics quantum mechanics neuroscience artificial intelligence perception emotion cultures norms valence arousal sensory experience chinese words translated english warriner et al perception emotion conveyed language influenced embodied experiences obtained social interactions vary different cultures explore cross cultural differences perception emotion chinese english speakers study collected norms valence arousal native mandarin speakers chinese words translated warriner et al additionally sensory experience ratings word collected analysis demonstrated reliability dataset satisfactory indicated comparisons previous datasets examined distributions valence arousal entire dataset positive negative emotion categories analysis suggested valence arousal sensory experience correlated various psycholinguistic variables including number syllables number strokes imageability familiarity concreteness frequency age acquisition cross language comparison indicated native speakers chinese english differ perception emotional valence arousal largely cross cultural variations associated ecological sociopolitical religious factors dataset valuable resource research examining impact emotional sensory information chinese lexical processing bilingual research investigating interplay language emotion different cultural contexts,1
"From Vector Spaces to DRM lists: False Memory Generator, a software for automated generation of lists of stimuli inducing false memories",2023,10.31234/osf.io/4ksd6,,Marco A. Petilli; Marco Marelli; Giuliana Mazzoni; Michela Marchetti; Luca Rinaldi; Daniele Gatti,"The formation of false memories is one of the most widely studied topics in cognitive psychology. The Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm is a powerful tool for investigating false memories and revealing the cognitive mechanisms subserving their formation. In this task, participants first memorize a list of words (encoding phase) and next have to indicate whether words presented in a new list were part of the initially memorized one (recognition phase). By employing DRM lists optimized to investigate semantic effects, previous studies highlighted a crucial role of semantic processes in false memory generation, showing that new words semantically related to the studied ones tend to be more erroneously recognized (compared to new words less semantically related). Despite the strengths of the DRM task, this paradigm faces a major limitation in list construction due to its reliance on human-based association norms, posing both practical and theoretical concerns. To address these issues, we developed a False Memory Generator (FMG), an automated and data-driven tool for generating DRM lists, which exploits similarity relationships between items populating a vector space. Here, we present FMG and demonstrate the validity of the lists generated in successfully replicating well-known semantic effects on false memory production. FMG has potentially broad applications by allowing for testing false memory production in domains that go well beyond the current possibilities, as it can be in principle applied to any vector space encoding properties related to word referents (e.g., lexical, orthographic, phonological, sensory, affective, etc.) or other type of stimuli (e.g., images, sounds, etc.).","['False memory', 'Computer science', 'Generator (circuit theory)', 'Software', 'Pattern recognition (psychology)', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Psychology', 'Programming language', 'Recall', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Power (physics)', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics']",https://openalex.org/W4387338039,True,0,10.31234/osf.io/4ksd6,false memory computer science generator circuit theory software pattern recognition psychology artificial intelligence psychology programming language recall cognitive psychology power physics physics quantum mechanics vector spaces drm lists false memory generator software automated generation lists stimuli inducing false memories formation false memories widely studied topics cognitive psychology deeseroedigermcdermott drm paradigm powerful tool investigating false memories revealing cognitive mechanisms subserving formation task participants memorize list words encoding phase indicate words presented new list initially memorized recognition phase employing drm lists optimized investigate semantic effects previous studies highlighted crucial role semantic processes false memory generation showing new words semantically related studied ones tend erroneously recognized compared new words semantically related despite strengths drm task paradigm faces major limitation list construction reliance human based association norms posing practical theoretical concerns address issues developed false memory generator fmg automated data driven tool generating drm lists exploits similarity relationships items populating vector space present fmg demonstrate validity lists generated successfully replicating known semantic effects false memory production fmg potentially broad applications allowing testing false memory production domains current possibilities principle applied vector space encoding properties related word referents e g lexical orthographic phonological sensory affective type stimuli e g images sounds,1
"The Use of -ly Adverbs in Novice and Expert Writing: A Comparative Corpus-Based Analysis of TICLE, LOCNESS, and BNC Corpora",2025,10.21547/jss.1668184,Gaziantep University Journal of Social Sciences,Sibel Aybek,"Adverbs play a central role in structuring discourse, conveying speaker stance, and modifying propositional content. -Ly adverbs constitute up to 55% of common adverbs and are frequently used in academic prose. Attaining a nuanced grasp of adverbial usage in learner English, and of how closely Turkish learners’ patterns align with native-speaker norms, is crucial. In this regard, this paper examines the use of -ly adverbs by Turkish EFL learners of English in comparison to native speakers. The investigation relies on two corpora of novice academic English: The Turkish International Corpus of Learner English (TICLE) and the Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays (LOCNESS), and one corpus of expert academic English: BNC (British National Corpus), representing learner and native speaker writing. The frequencies, lexical choices, and the distribution of -ly adverbs were analyzed across three corpora. In addition, syntactic functions of the identified -ly adverbs were classified according to Quirk et al. (1985) and Hasselgård’s (2015) classifications. The analysis reveals that Turkish EFL learners rely on a narrower range of -ly adverbs, frequently using those associated with spoken rather than academic discourse, whereas native expert writers demonstrate a more varied and academically appropriate adverbial repertoire. Additionally, Turkish learners underuse most -ly adverb categories, particularly adjuncts and disjuncts, while overusing conjuncts and intensifiers. These findings highlight the gap between native and non-native academic writing, emphasizing the need for explicit instruction in the use of adverbials to develop a more advanced academic style.","['Linguistics', 'Corpus linguistics', 'Natural language processing', 'Psychology', 'Linguistic analysis', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4412495639,True,0,10.21547/jss.1668184,linguistics corpus linguistics natural language processing psychology linguistic analysis computer science philosophy use ly adverbs novice expert writing comparative corpus based analysis ticle locness bnc corpora adverbs play central role structuring discourse conveying speaker stance modifying propositional content ly adverbs constitute common adverbs frequently used academic prose attaining nuanced grasp adverbial usage learner english closely turkish learners patterns align native speaker norms crucial regard paper examines use ly adverbs turkish efl learners english comparison native speakers investigation relies corpora novice academic english turkish international corpus learner english ticle louvain corpus native english essays locness corpus expert academic english bnc british national corpus representing learner native speaker writing frequencies lexical choices distribution ly adverbs analyzed corpora addition syntactic functions identified ly adverbs classified according quirk et al hasselgards classifications analysis reveals turkish efl learners rely narrower range ly adverbs frequently using associated spoken academic discourse native expert writers demonstrate varied academically appropriate adverbial repertoire additionally turkish learners underuse ly adverb categories particularly adjuncts disjuncts overusing conjuncts intensifiers findings highlight gap native non native academic writing emphasizing need explicit instruction use adverbials develop advanced academic style,1
Bidimensional Features of Prosody and Semantic are Sufficient for Inferring and Predicting Threatening Speech Comprehension,2021,10.31219/osf.io/k2juq,,Simón Busch Moreno; David R. Vinson,"The present study investigates how variation in acoustic measures and lexical semantic properties affect the comprehension of threatening speech. Two experiments were conducted in British English, where participants had to rate the threat of three types of sentences: sentences neutral in prosody and semantics, sentences containing only prosodic threat, and sentences containing only semantic threat. They also rated the sentences for arousal and valence, and categorised them by type of emotional expression. Threat ratings were analysed via Bayesian ordered-logistic regressions using acoustic measures and affective norms as regressors. Classification was assessed via simple Bayesian categorical (Dirichlet prior) models. Acoustic properties of stimuli were compared through a Bayesian method for comparison of means to test whether neutral stimuli differ, on average, from their threatening counterparts. Acoustic but not semantic properties affected ratings of threatening prosody (increased pitch and decreased voice quality predicting increased threat), while the reverse was true for ratings of threatening semantics (increased arousal and decreased valence predicting increased threat). Using data from the first speaker (first experiment) the models were able to predict ratings given to sentences produced by the second speaker (second experiment). Furthermore, threatening sentences of both types tended to be categorized as angry or enraged. These results are interpreted as supporting the sufficiency of the selected measures (pitch, voice quality, arousal, valence) to characterise threat. Although multidimensional models may be better suited for describing threatening prosody/semantics, the present approach demonstrates that selected bidimensional features are sufficient to identify and predict threat comprehension efficiently and accurately.","['Prosody', 'Categorical variable', 'Valence (chemistry)', 'Psychology', 'Arousal', 'Comprehension', 'Speech recognition', 'Semantics (computer science)', 'Emotional prosody', 'Cognitive psychology', 'Bayesian probability', 'Natural language processing', 'Computer science', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Social psychology', 'Machine learning', 'Physics', 'Quantum mechanics', 'Programming language']",https://openalex.org/W4236895207,False,0,10.31219/osf.io/k2juq,prosody categorical variable valence chemistry psychology arousal comprehension speech recognition semantics computer science emotional prosody cognitive psychology bayesian probability natural language processing computer science artificial intelligence social psychology machine learning physics quantum mechanics programming language bidimensional features prosody semantic sufficient inferring predicting threatening speech comprehension present study investigates variation acoustic measures lexical semantic properties affect comprehension threatening speech experiments conducted british english participants rate threat types sentences sentences neutral prosody semantics sentences containing prosodic threat sentences containing semantic threat rated sentences arousal valence categorised type emotional expression threat ratings analysed bayesian ordered logistic regressions using acoustic measures affective norms regressors classification assessed simple bayesian categorical dirichlet prior models acoustic properties stimuli compared bayesian method comparison means test neutral stimuli differ average threatening counterparts acoustic semantic properties affected ratings threatening prosody increased pitch decreased voice quality predicting increased threat reverse true ratings threatening semantics increased arousal decreased valence predicting increased threat using data speaker experiment models able predict ratings given sentences produced second speaker second experiment furthermore threatening sentences types tended categorized angry enraged results interpreted supporting sufficiency selected measures pitch voice quality arousal valence characterise threat multidimensional models better suited describing threatening prosody semantics present approach demonstrates selected bidimensional features sufficient identify predict threat comprehension efficiently accurately,1
An Investigation of Morphophonological Nativisation of English Loanwords in Nyakyusa,2025,10.9734/ajess/2025/v51i31830,Asian Journal of Education and Social Studies,Alto Barnabas; Ancyfrida Prosper,"Nyakyusa is the Bantu language registered as M.31 and it is spoken in the South-Western part of Tanzania, particularly in Mbeya Region and some parts of Njombe. Similar to other languages, the Nyakyusa is in contact with the English language whose lexicon is fed by the English loanwords. This study aimed to explore how English loanwords are adapted and integrated into the Nyakyusa language. English is one of the most widely spoken languages globally, and its contact with Nyakyusa has become the primary source of loanwords, with approximately 95 percent of Nyakyusa’s borrowed vocabulary originating from English. The English loanwords in Nyakyusa are adapted to suit the Nyakyusa morphophonotactics because the two languages have dissimilar morphophonotactics. Additionally, English has influenced the phonological structure of Nyakyusa. This is because borrowed words are adapted to fit the sound system of the Nyakyusa language. The theoretical framework for this study is based on the Lexical Phonology and Morphology (LPM) theory. The study adopted a descriptive research design, structured within an interpretive research paradigm, and employed a qualitative research methodology. The study employed a purposive sampling of 14 native Nyakyusa speakers. Data were collected through participant observations, interviews, and documentary reviews and subsequently analysed thematically. The findings revealed that the Nyakyusa language integrates English loanwords through several morphophonological processes, including segmental substitution, vowel epenthesis, glide epenthesis, segmental deletion, and segmental retention. These processes help to modify English morphophonotactic elements that violate the Nyakyusa language norms. The researchers recommend conducting comparative studies on the nativisation processes in other Bantu languages in order to contextualise the findings and highlight unique or shared features within the language family.","['Linguistics', 'Natural language processing', 'History', 'Computer science', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4408623698,False,0,10.9734/ajess/2025/v51i31830,linguistics natural language processing history computer science philosophy investigation morphophonological nativisation english loanwords nyakyusa nyakyusa bantu language registered m spoken south western tanzania particularly mbeya region parts njombe similar languages nyakyusa contact english language lexicon fed english loanwords study aimed explore english loanwords adapted integrated nyakyusa language english widely spoken languages globally contact nyakyusa primary source loanwords approximately percent nyakyusas borrowed vocabulary originating english english loanwords nyakyusa adapted suit nyakyusa morphophonotactics languages dissimilar morphophonotactics additionally english influenced phonological structure nyakyusa borrowed words adapted fit sound nyakyusa language theoretical framework study based lexical phonology morphology lpm theory study adopted descriptive research design structured interpretive research paradigm employed qualitative research methodology study employed purposive sampling native nyakyusa speakers data collected participant observations interviews documentary reviews subsequently analysed thematically findings revealed nyakyusa language integrates english loanwords morphophonological processes including segmental substitution vowel epenthesis glide epenthesis segmental deletion segmental retention processes help modify english morphophonotactic elements violate nyakyusa language norms researchers recommend conducting comparative studies nativisation processes bantu languages order contextualise findings highlight unique shared features language family,1

Skobnikova,"The article describes the linguial characteristics of sibling communication on the basis of English-language family film texts. The object of the study is family communication, and its subject is the specifics of the lingual realization of the basic roles of family members, namely siblings, represented by modern English-language film texts intended for family viewing. The main types of personality-oriented communication in the family sphere are matrimonial communication (""husband - wife""), parental communication (""parents - children""), sibling communication (""brothers – sisters""). Quantitative analysis of fragments of communication between siblings, taken from family film texts, shows that communication between them is represented mostly in the form of a dialogue (93%) and is characterized by a kind of internal community of partners, the presence of a single subject of conversation and a certain freedom of exchange. During the communication of brothers and sisters, various communicative situations arise, in each of which certain strategies dominate. The main ones are strategies of cooperation, rivalry and demonstration of neutrality. Cooperation occurs when siblings in communicative situations of interaction have a common goal and common means of achieving this goal. Rivalry occurs when siblings have different goals and differ in the means to achieve them. Neutrality is manifested in situations of achieving hidden individual goals. Quantitative analysis of emotionally colored phrases with tokens to denote siblings shows that they are mostly positively colored. The main lingual form of realization of interpersonal family relations is conversational speech, that results in direct personal communication, which involves situational conditionality and commonality of the base of speakers. In the colloquial speech of members of the English-speaking family there is a lack of clear regulation of literary norms, arbitrariness in the selection of lexical items (the use of dialectisms, colloquial words, vulgarisms, jargon, humorous units).

Un corpus de copies d’examen aux niveaux Avancé et Intermédiaire est fouillé pour les possibilités de phénomènes de transfert, catégorisés en cinq types, émanant de difficultés orthographiques, de choix de mots, ou sémantiques, ces dernières provoquant l’utilisation des faux-amis. Les résultats sont comparés aux conclusions d’études faites dans les cadres maltais et international. La fréquence des contacts linguistiques dans le corpus est probablement attribuable tant à l’alternance codique, comportement omniprésent à Malte, qu’à la nature même de la rédaction en L2, activité forcément bilingue.

L’hétérogénéité de la répartition des marqueurs modaux dans le discours juridique en russe,2022,10.35562/elad-silda.1113,ELAD-SILDA,Anton Osminkin,"L’objet de cet article est, en premier lieu, de faire apparaître des marqueurs de la modalité déontique dans des textes appartenant au discours juridique en russe. Autrement dit, il s’agit des formes grammaticales et lexicales qui sont employées afin d’exprimer l’obligation. Notre corpus de textes juridiques est organisé selon la hiérarchie des normes proposée par Hans Kelsen, théoricien du droit et fondateur de l’école normativiste. Cette hiérarchie se présente sous la forme d’une pyramide dont le sommet se réfère au niveau juridique le plus élevé, c’est-à-dire le bloc constitutionnel, alors que sa base implique le niveau le plus bas, le bloc contractuel. Selon notre analyse, dans le bloc constitutionnel, le marqueur de l’obligation le plus fréquent est le présent imperfectif, tandis que dans le bloc contractuel on peut constater une variété de marqueurs modaux exprimant l’obligation, tels que должен, обязан, подлежит, etc. Ainsi, dans une approche jurilinguistique, nous révèlerons, en deuxième lieu, des liens entre la nature juridique de chaque type de textes appartenant à différents blocs de la pyramide et le choix des marqueurs de la modalité déontique qui y expriment l’obligation. Dans une perspective sémasiologique, nous posons qu’une telle répartition des marqueurs de l’obligation permet de reconstruire les traces d’une forme d’échange communicationnel entre l’énonciateur et les destinataires dans le discours qui est traditionnellement considéré comme discours non communicationnel avec effacement énonciatif de toute voix parlante.Notre étude n’est pas inscrite dans un cadre théorique précis, mais elle est inspirée, néanmoins, par la grammaire cognitive, l’analyse du discours ainsi que par la linguistique de corpus.","['Humanities', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4282007660,True,0,10.35562/elad-silda.1113,humanities philosophy lheterogeneite la repartition des marqueurs modaux dans le discours juridique en russe lobjet cet article est en premier lieu faire apparaitre des marqueurs la modalite deontique dans des textes appartenant au discours juridique en russe autrement dit il sagit des formes grammaticales et lexicales qui sont employees afin dexprimer lobligation notre corpus textes juridiques est organise selon la hierarchie des normes proposee par hans kelsen theoricien du droit et fondateur lecole normativiste cette hierarchie se presente sous la forme dune pyramide dont le sommet se refere au niveau juridique le plus eleve cest dire le bloc constitutionnel alors que sa base implique le niveau le plus bas le bloc contractuel selon notre analyse dans le bloc constitutionnel le marqueur lobligation le plus frequent est le present imperfectif tandis que dans le bloc contractuel peut constater une variete marqueurs modaux exprimant lobligation tels que ainsi dans une approche jurilinguistique nous revelerons en deuxieme lieu des liens entre la nature juridique chaque type textes appartenant differents blocs la pyramide et le choix des marqueurs la modalite deontique qui y expriment lobligation dans une perspective semasiologique nous posons quune telle repartition des marqueurs lobligation permet reconstruire les traces dune forme dechange communicationnel entre lenonciateur et les destinataires dans le discours qui est traditionnellement considere comme discours non communicationnel avec effacement enonciatif toute voix parlante notre etude nest pas inscrite dans cadre theorique precis mais elle est inspiree neanmoins par la grammaire cognitive lanalyse du discours ainsi que par la linguistique corpus,1
RUSSIAN BORROWINGS IN THE TEXTS OF KHAKASS HEROIC TALES,2024,10.52782/kril.2024.1.41.007,SCIENTIFIC REVIEW OF SAYANO-ALTAI,М. Д. Чертыкова,"Статья посвящена функционально-семантическому анализу и описанию русских заимствований в текстах хакасских героических сказаний. Не претендуя на всеобщий охват анализируемого материала, на примере 18 лексем мы установили, что тексты героических сказаний, в силу традиционности жанра, являются относительно закрытыми для иноязычных новшеств. Гораздо больше русизмов встречается в произведениях малых фольклорных жанров, поскольку они передаются в произвольной повествовательной форме. Процесс проникновения заимствований в данную сферу зависит от их фонетической и лексико-грамматической адаптации в языке-реципиенте. Почти все рассмотренные нами заимствования видоизменены в соответствии с нормами хакасского языка. В лексико-семантическом плане все они распределены на три типа: а) не имеющие аналогов в хакасском языке заимствованные слова, зафиксированные в лексикографических источниках; б) имеющие аналоги в хакасском языке заимствованные слова, зафиксированные в лексикографических источниках; в) разовые, эпизодичные использования русизмов. Данную категорию слов составляют в основном существительные, за исключением глаголов просай 'прощай', че[е]сте- 'чествовать' и междометной конструкции какой чорт. Обсуждение фактического материала в нашей работе происходит в рамках нашего понимания терминов «русское заимствование», выражающего частотное и, как правило, лексикографически зафиксированное слово, и «русизм» как русского слова, эпизодически используемого в повседневной речи билингва. В перспективе дальнейшее углубленное изучение данной категории слов на материале хакасских героических сказаний раскроет их новые скрытые особенности и закономерности. The article is devoted to the functional-semantic analysis and description of Russian borrowings in the texts of Khakass heroic tales. Without claiming universal coverage of the analyzed material, using the example of 18 lexemes, we established that the texts of heroic tales, due to the traditional nature of the genre, are relatively closed to foreign language innovations. Much more Russianisms are found in works of small folklore genres, since they are conveyed in an arbitrary narrative form. The process of borrowings penetration into this area depends on their phonetic and lexico-grammatical adaptation in the recipient language. Almost all of the borrowings we examined are modified in accordance with the norms of the Khakass language. In lexical-semantic terms, they are all divided into three types: a) borrowed words that have no analogues in the Khakass language and are recorded in lexicographical sources; b) borrowed words that have analogues in the Khakass language and are recorded in lexicographic sources; c) one-time, episodic use of Russianisms. This category of words consists mainly of nouns, with the exception of the verbs prosai 'farewell', che[е]ste- 'honor' and the interjectional construction kakoichort. The discussion of factual material in our work takes place within the framework of our concepts of the terms ""Russian borrowing"", which expresses a frequency and, as a rule, lexicographically fixed word, and ""Russianism"", as a Russian word occasionally used in a bilingual's everyday speech. In the future, further in-depth study of this category of words based on the material of Khakass heroic tales will reveal their new hidden features and patterns.","['Linguistics', 'History', 'Literature', 'Art', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W4394619881,True,0,10.52782/kril.2024.1.41.007,linguistics history literature art philosophy russian borrowings texts khakass heroic tales article devoted functional semantic analysis description russian borrowings texts khakass heroic tales claiming universal coverage analyzed material using example lexemes established texts heroic tales traditional nature genre relatively closed foreign language innovations russianisms works small folklore genres conveyed arbitrary narrative form process borrowings penetration area depends phonetic lexico grammatical adaptation recipient language borrowings examined modified accordance norms khakass language lexical semantic terms divided types borrowed words analogues khakass language recorded lexicographical sources b borrowed words analogues khakass language recorded lexicographic sources c time episodic use russianisms category words consists mainly nouns exception verbs prosai farewell che ste honor interjectional construction kakoichort discussion factual material work takes place framework concepts terms russian borrowing expresses frequency rule lexicographically fixed word russianism russian word occasionally used bilingual everyday speech future depth study category words based material khakass heroic tales reveal new hidden features patterns,1
Perception of the Lexeme 'Europe' by Students: A Psycholinguistic Analysis,2018,10.29038/eejpl.2018.5.1.pos,East European Journal of Psycholinguistics,Ірина Постолова; Наталія Томарєва,"The article analyzes the results of the free associative experiment, which was conducted among first-year students during 2016-2018. According to the frequency of reactions, the authors model the structure of the associative field: nucleus, body and periphery; define the morphological and semantic groups of associations on the word-stimulus ‘Europe’ obtained during the experiment, analyze the syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationships among the reactions, build the structure of the resulting associative field. The responses of respondents are significantly dominated by nouns; occasionally occur adjectives, verbs, adverbs and pronouns; adjectives and adverbs are mostly colored with emotions and estimations. Phrases make a significant group of associations phrases (about one fifth). Among the above mentioned things, toponyms and surnames of well-known political figures are named. Semantically, all associations are divided in general cultural, economic and political, such ones that express aesthetic perception of the word-stimulus, as well as those related to travel and leisure. Special attention in the article is given to emotional coloring of reactions (they are divided in positive, negative and neutral). Thus, the material presented in the work reflects, to a certain extent, the perception of the word-stimulus 'Europe' by contemporary student youth.&#x0D; References&#x0D; &#x0D; Горошко Е.

Нове двомовне фразеологічне видання: полемічна рефлексія,2020,10.11649/sfps.1975,Studia z Filologii Polskiej i Słowiańskiej,Tetyana Kosmeda; Олена Olena Олегівна Olehivna Ковалевська Kovalevsʹka,"A New Bilingual Phraseological Dictionary: A Polemical ReflectionThis article presents a critical analysis of the bilingual publication entitled A Lexicon of Polish and Ukrainian Active Phraseology (Leksykon aktywnej frazeologii polskiej i ukraińskiej / Leksykon pol′s′koï ta ukraïns′koï aktyvnoï frazeolohiï), compiled by Roman Tymoshuk, Wojciech Sosnowski, Maciej Jaskot and Yurii Ganoshenko. In the history of Ukrainian-Polish and Polish-Ukrainian phraseography of the twenty-first century, this is the second attempt at creating a bilingual phraseological dictionary, following the publication of A Concise Ukrainian-Polish Dictionary of Set Expressions: Lexical Equivalents, Phraseologisms, Proverbs and Sayings (Korotkyĭ ukraïns′ko-pol′s′kyĭ slovnyk ustalenykh vyraziv: Ekvivalenty slova, frazeolohizmy, prysliv′ia ta prykazky, Poznań and Kharkiv, 2017), compiled by Tetiana Kosmeda, Olena Homeniuk and Tetiana Osipova.The distinctive feature of the reviewed dictionary is that it contains phraseologisms which are most widely used in everyday speech. The compilers developed an original conception: (1) Polish-Ukrainian and Ukrainian-Polish parts differ in content, as they were compiled independently, yet most popular phraseologisms are included in both parts; (2) the most representative set expressions in active use in both languages were selected on the basis of questionnaires and mass media material; (3) entries include illustrative material; (4) it has an optimal size – about 1,000 phraseological units.On the other hand, the dictionary also has some drawbacks, such as: (1) it lacks key criteria for determining the status of the notion “active” phraseology; (2) it does not include slang phraseologisms which do not belong to literary language; (3) the meanings of phraseological units are described by means of simple syntactic structures which lack consistent criteria of clarity and comprehensibility of interpretation, and the dictionary does not cover all semantic potential and pragmatic information of the listed units; (4) excessively categorical interpretation of the notion zero equivalence; (5) not all entries contain stylistic labels, and those used are only of three types: slang, colloquial, vulgar; the label przyslowie/приказка (proverb) seems incorrect, as the compilers do not provide criteria of its separate status; (6) metalanguage of the dictionary is marked with some violations of orthographic and stylistic norms. Nevertheless, the dictionary has undoubtedly enriched the theory of phraseography, phraseographic practice and found its users. Polemiczna refleksja na temat nowego dwujęzycznego słownika frazeologicznegoNiniejszy artykuł przedstawia analizę krytyczną dwujęzycznego Leksykonu aktywnej frazeologii polskiej i ukraińskiej (Лексикон польської та української активної фразеології), autorstwa Romana Tymoshuka, Wojciecha Sosnowskiego, Macieja Jaskota i Yuriia Ganoshenki.

Autorzy zastosowali oryginalną koncepcję, w myśl której: (1) pomimo że część polsko-ukraińska i ukraińsko-polska mają różną zawartość, powstawały bowiem niezależnie, każda z nich zawiera najbardziej popularne frazeologizmy; (2) najbardziej reprezentatywne wyrażenia wybrano na podstawie badań kwestionariuszowych i materiałów ze środków masowego przekazu; (3) hasła zawierają przykłady ilustrujące ich użycie; (4) słownik ma optymalną wielkość: zawiera około tysiąca jednostek frazeologicznych.Z drugiej zaś strony, słownik ma również pewne niedociągnięcia, wśród których należy wymienić: (1) brak określenia kluczowych elementów pojęcia „aktywna” frazeologia; (2) nieuwzględnienie wyrażeń slangowych nienależących do języka literackiego; (3) opis znaczeń frazeologizmów za pomocą prostych struktur syntaktycznych, którym brak spójnych kryteriów jasności i zrozumiałości interpretacyjnej, co sprawia, że słownik nie w pełni uwzględnia potencjał semantyczny i informację pragmatyczną przedstawianych wyrażeń; (4) zbyt kategoryczna interpretacja pojęcia brak ekwiwalencji; (5) nie wszystkie hasła są opatrzone kwalifikatorami stylistycznymi, a lista tych ostatnich ogranicza się jedynie do trzech: slang, potoczne, wulgarne; kwalifikator przysłowie/приказка wydaje się niepoprawny, jako że autorzy nie podają kryteriów, na podstawie których go wyodrębniono; (6) metajęzyk słownika cechuje się pewnymi naruszeniami norm ortograficznych i stylistycznych. Niemniej jednak słownik z pewnością wzbogacił teorię frazeografii i praktykę frazeograficzną, oraz spotkał się z zainteresowaniem ze strony użytkowników.","['Phraseology', 'Ukrainian', 'Linguistics', 'Lexicon', 'Slang', 'Part of speech', 'Bilingual dictionary', 'Computer science', 'History', 'Philosophy']",https://openalex.org/W3126605653,True,0,10.11649/sfps.1975,phraseology ukrainian linguistics lexicon slang speech bilingual dictionary computer science history philosophy new bilingual phraseological dictionary polemical reflectionthis article presents critical analysis bilingual publication entitled lexicon polish ukrainian active phraseology leksykon aktywnej frazeologii polskiej ukrainskiej leksykon polskoi ta ukrainskoi aktyvnoi frazeolohii compiled roman tymoshuk wojciech sosnowski maciej jaskot yurii ganoshenko history ukrainian polish polish ukrainian phraseography century second attempt creating bilingual phraseological dictionary following publication concise ukrainian polish dictionary set expressions lexical equivalents phraseologisms proverbs sayings korotkyi ukrainsko polskyi slovnyk ustalenykh vyraziv ekvivalenty slova frazeolohizmy pryslivia ta prykazky poznan kharkiv compiled tetiana kosmeda olena homeniuk tetiana osipova distinctive feature reviewed dictionary contains phraseologisms widely used everyday speech compilers developed original conception polish ukrainian ukrainian polish parts differ content compiled independently popular phraseologisms included parts representative set expressions active use languages selected basis questionnaires mass media material entries include illustrative material optimal size phraseological units hand dictionary drawbacks lacks key criteria determining status notion active phraseology does include slang phraseologisms belong literary language meanings phraseological units described means simple syntactic structures lack consistent criteria clarity comprehensibility interpretation dictionary does cover semantic potential pragmatic information listed units excessively categorical interpretation notion zero equivalence entries contain stylistic labels used types slang colloquial vulgar label przyslowie proverb incorrect compilers provide criteria separate status metalanguage dictionary marked violations orthographic stylistic norms dictionary undoubtedly enriched theory phraseography phraseographic practice users polemiczna refleksja temat nowego dwujezycznego sownika frazeologicznegoniniejszy artyku przedstawia analize krytyczna dwujezycznego leksykonu aktywnej frazeologii polskiej ukrainskiej autorstwa romana tymoshuka wojciecha sosnowskiego macieja jaskota yuriia ganoshenki jest drugi dwujezyczny sownik frazeologiczny w historii ukrainsko polskiej polsko ukrainskiej frazeografii xxi wieku po maym ukrainsko polskim sowniku utrwalonych wyrazen jezykowych ekwiwalenty frazeologizmy powiedzenia przysowia poznancharkow tetiany kosmedy oleny homeniuk tetiany osipovej cecha wyrozniajaca recenzowany sownik jest jego zawartosc frazeologizmy powszechnie uzywane ca dzien autorzy zastosowali oryginalna koncepcje w mysl ktorej pomimo ze czesc polsko ukrainska ukrainsko polska maja rozna zawartosc powstaway bowiem niezaleznie kazda z nich zawiera najbardziej popularne frazeologizmy najbardziej reprezentatywne wyrazenia wybrano podstawie badan kwestionariuszowych materiaow ze srodkow masowego przekazu hasa zawieraja przykady ilustrujace ich uzycie sownik ma optymalna wielkosc zawiera okoo tysiaca jednostek frazeologicznych z drugiej zas strony sownik ma rowniez pewne niedociagniecia wsrod ktorych nalezy wymienic brak okreslenia kluczowych elementow pojecia aktywna frazeologia nieuwzglednienie wyrazen slangowych nienalezacych jezyka literackiego opis znaczen frazeologizmow za pomoca prostych struktur syntaktycznych ktorym brak spojnych kryteriow jasnosci zrozumiaosci interpretacyjnej sprawia ze sownik nie w peni uwzglednia potencja semantyczny informacje pragmatyczna przedstawianych wyrazen zbyt kategoryczna interpretacja pojecia brak ekwiwalencji nie wszystkie hasa sa opatrzone kwalifikatorami stylistycznymi lista tych ostatnich ogranicza sie jedynie trzech slang potoczne wulgarne kwalifikator przysowie wydaje sie niepoprawny jako ze autorzy nie podaja kryteriow podstawie ktorych wyodrebniono metajezyk sownika cechuje sie pewnymi naruszeniami norm ortograficznych stylistycznych niemniej jednak sownik z pewnoscia wzbogaci teorie frazeografii praktyke frazeograficzna oraz spotka sie z zainteresowaniem ze strony uzytkownikow,1
A preliminary report of effects of psycholinguistic variables on open-class word production in discourse among Cantonese speakers with traumatic brain injury and controls,2018,10.3389/conf.fnhum.2018.228.00042,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,O-Ki Hui; Anthony Pak‐Hin Kong; Dustin Kai-Yan Lau,"Event Abstract Back to Event A preliminary report of effects of psycholinguistic variables on open-class word production in discourse among Cantonese speakers with traumatic brain injury and controls O-Ki Hui1, Anthony Pak Hin Kong2* and Kai-Yan Dustin Lau1 1 Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies, Hong Kong, SAR China 2 University of Central Florida, Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, United States Background Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are found to demonstrate deficits in word retrieval, to express ideas less clearly, and to produce fewer meaningful words (Tucker & Hanlon, 1998). German (1987) indicated that the word retrieval system must be examined not only through confrontation naming but also in spontaneous language. King et al. (2006) suggested that discourse may not be a sensitive measure of word finding difficulties for the mild TBI population, at least relative to error type (e.g. semantic errors). Moreover, various psycholinguistic variables have been reported to affect one’s performance in word-naming tasks (Liu et al., 2007). These variables include word frequency (FREQ), familiarity (FAM), age of acquisition (AoA), imaginability (IMAG), and concreteness (CONC). Aim This paper aimed to investigate if and how open-class word production in spoken discourse is affected by psycholinguistic variables previously reported to associate with performance in word finding. Specifically, we compared the production of open-class words in Cantonese-speakers with TBI and their controls to determine whether FREQ, FAM, AoA, IMAG, and CONC were reflective of the use of open-class words in their spontaneous oral narratives. Methods Ten Cantonese-speaking participants in Guangzhou (China) with a single closed-head TBI were recruited. They had a post onset time of at least four months. Language samples containing description of a single picture “Cat rescue” and storytelling of “The tortoise and the hare” were collected using the Chinese AphasiaBank protocol (see Kong and Law, 2018) modified for TBI. Ten unimpaired native Cantonese speakers were also invited to participate as controls to provide the same language samples for determining the target content units (including lexical items in the category of nouns, verbs, and adjectives that appeared in the control samples) of each genre. Another ten unimpaired Cantonese-speaking adults participated to provide ratings of the FAM, AoA, IMAG, and CONC of the target content units based on the method in Barca et al. (2002). The FREQ ratings were adopted from the corpus of Chinese text computing (Da, 2004). Results and Discussion The results of a Chi-square test to compare the distribution of total high and low-FREQ, FAM, AoA, IMAG, and CONC words between speaker groups revealed significant difference in the distribution of high and low-IMAG verbs (χ² (2)=4.364, p<0.05, df=1) in the “Cat rescue” task. Controls produced significantly more number of low-IMAG verbs. Moreover, significant differences in the distribution of high vs. low-FREQ nouns (χ² (2)=7.64, p<0.01, df=1), high vs. low-IMAG nouns (χ² (2)=9.581, p<0.01, df=1), and high vs. low-CONC nouns (χ² (2)=9.581, p<0.01, df=1) were found in the “The tortoise and the hare” task. Again, controls produced significantly more low-FREQ, IMAG, and CONC nouns than the TBI group. A larger group of speakers with TBI is being interviewed to allow a more sensitive comparison of the word production to unimpaired controls. Additional analyses to examine the effects of sentence length on the word production as characterized by different psycholinguistic variables in the TBI group are in progress.

Language Sample Analysis: New and Neglected Clinical Applications,2020,10.1097/tld.0000000000000215,Topics in Language Disorders,,"As a newly credentialed speech–language pathologist, my clinical work included evaluating young children whose parents were concerned about their speech and language development. In graduate school, I had learned about Developmental Sentence Scoring (DSS; Lee & Canter, 1971) from its developer, Laura Lee, herself. The procedure relied on a tape-recorded sample of 50 consecutive complete and intelligible utterances obtained during a play-based conversation with an adult. Once the sample was transcribed, clinicians examined each sentence for the presence of major syntactic features (pronouns, verbs, negatives, conjunctions, questions, etc.), with results informing disorder identification and intervention. I remember being thrilled to have an assessment tool based on samples of real, connected speech and language. At the same time, I found myself wondering whether utterances from a play session in a strange place with a strange person would be representative of a child's “true” language. Would DSS results hold if I had followed the child around at home for a few days? So, I developed a research project in which preschool children were fitted with a wireless microphone/transmitter so they could be recorded unencumbered talking with their mothers at home (Scott & Taylor, 1978). Compared with clinical language samples from the same children, sentences at home were significantly longer and had higher frequencies of structures reflecting the content of home conversations (e.g., past tense verbs, questions, and complex sentences). The use of language samples for clinical purposes has continued to motivate much of my research agenda to the present time. Since the early 1970s, clinical applications tied to language sample analysis (LSA) have expanded considerably. For instance, other grammar-based analysis systems in addition to DSS appeared (e.g., Index of Productive Syntax [IPSyn]; Scarborough, 1990). Jon Miller, beginning in the 1980s, has been a strong advocate for the use of language samples by researchers and clinicians who work with children with language disorders (Miller, 1981). Miller et al. developed a computer program, now widely used, that provides automatic calculation of lexical and syntactic features along with normative information in the form of reference databases (Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts [SALT]; Miller & Iglesias, 2016). Interest in naturalistic language characteristics expanded beyond young children to older school-age children and adolescents; beyond conversation during play to narrative and expository discourse; beyond spoken language to written language; and beyond assessment to progress monitoring during intervention. There is a robust literature addressing methodological issues that impact reliability and validity of LSA (e.g., sample size needed for reliability, relationships between LSA and norm-referenced test outcomes, sensitivity and specificity of various measures, and comparisons of computer-based programs). This high level of interest in LSA continues to the present (see Pezold, Imgrund, & Storkel, 2020, for a comparison of computer analyses of language samples from preschool children). Although LSA has found broad use among researchers of spoken and written language disorders, surveys of clinical and educational use are disappointing. Because survey respondents often cite time constraints as a major obstacle, some research has addressed this concern by documenting time requirements in approaches that streamline LSA in various ways. The articles in this issue take a different approach. Each article explores a new and/or neglected topic of LSA that authors believe should stimulate both research and clinical interest in LSA applications. Collectively, the first three articles cover topics pertinent to preschool, school-age, and adult uses of LSA. Two articles are devoted to LSA in clinical practice with bilingual children. A final contribution centers on LSA of writing in school-age populations. In her article on LSA with preschool children, Eisenberg (2020) argues for the use of three measures that are seldom discussed: use of word combinations (particularly those involving a verb and another word), use of required and optional sentence constituents (e.g., SVO), and use of complex sentences (two or more clauses). She makes a compelling case for the developmental significance of these measures and their importance as indicators of intervention outcomes, as contrasted with more commonly reported measures including mean length of utterance and morphosyntactic accuracy. Although difficulty with morphosyntax is a common feature of language impairment in preschool children and, consequently, a common, if not predominant, focus of intervention, Eisenberg argues that the measures she describes are critical. They increase a child's ability to convey information (content) and are consistent with the principle that communicative informativeness should be a central goal of intervention even before grammatical correctness. Underutilized to date in the preschool LSA literature, all three measures await study of their reliability and validity. Turning to school-age children and adolescents, Lundine's (2020) contribution is motivated by a gap that exists between language skills required to succeed in school, where learning depends on the comprehension and production of information encoded in expository discourse, and the availability of tools to assess such skills. Language sample analysis of expository discourse has the potential to help bridge this gap; yet, surveys show that even when clinicians use LSA with older students, they are more likely to assess conversational or narrative discourse. Lundine then offers a roadmap for LSA of expository discourse that includes discussion of elicitation techniques and observations at word, morphological, sentence, and discourse levels—those particularly characteristic of expository discourse. For example, at the morphological level, it is important to note a student's facility with derivational affixes needed for systems such as nominalization. Lundine then considers how a LSA assessment of a student's expository discourse can be used cooperatively by clinicians and educators in real classrooms to support student learning. In the next article, Spencer, Bryant, and Colyvas (2020) are concerned with the issue of LSA reliability. The fact that variability is inherent in naturalistic language poses problems for researchers addressing issues such as differential diagnosis and clinicians interested in whether a client's change over a course of intervention represents meaningful change. The authors provide an extensive literature review of how sample length variability and time-based variability (successive samples of the same individual) have been handled by researchers of both child and adult populations. Finding methodological problems, the authors propose a new method for determining whether measures in repeated language samples of individuals represent substantive change or simply normal variation. Their method, captured in a formula termed the Reliable Change Index (RCI), is complex but should stimulate considerable interest for both research and clinical applications. Two articles in the issue are concerned with LSA in bilingual children. As if variability inherent in monolingual speakers was not complicated enough, additional questions and methodological issues surface when using LSA with bilingual speakers. Parameters of the child's language experience—for instance, whether L1 and L2 are simultaneously or sequentially learned and whether L1 fades in light of L2—these and other factors must be navigated when devising elicitation methods, quantitative measures, and use of LSA for decision making. Drawing from an expanding literature on LSA of narrative discourse in bilingual children, Ebert (2020) walks the reader through these issues as she addresses procedural considerations such as elicitation, coding, and analysis (e.g., how to handle instances of code switching). The use of LSA in the identification of developmental language disorder in bilingual children is addressed next via a literature review centered on word-, sentence-, and discourse-level measures. Finally, Ebert is concerned with the use of LSA to determine language strengths and weaknesses that would, in turn, inform intervention. In a second article on LSA in bilingual children, Guiberson (2020) reports data from his own research aimed at determining associations among two alternative (and less time-consuming) LSA measures, traditional LSA measures, and a norm-referenced language test in a population of preschool bilingual children with and without language impairment. The alternative measures were clinician-reported and parent–reported longest utterance(s). Interesting patterns of associations among the three domains pointed to potential clinical uses for the alternative measures, although association strengths differed according to whether clinicians or parents were reporting. The last article in this issue centers on LSA of writing samples in school-age children and adolescents. Although writing has been less studied than speaking, Scott (2020) uncovered a body of work that allows at least tentative answers to questions that arise for practitioners. She reports on the sensitivity of common measures of writing to questions concerning developmental change, language ability differences, relation to quality ratings, practical utility, and effects of genre and task. Scott also encourages writing-specific observations such as literate vocabulary use, unique syntax patterns, and spelling. The authors have provided rich examples and case studies that should assist practitioners interested in clinical and classroom applications. Even though LSA topics in this issue are new and/or neglected, all the authors have addressed ways their information can inform practice. Language sample analysis has come a long way from its early days when its main use was to count a small set of grammatical structures to the point where we learn about language use at many levels, in multiple genres and modes, and for different types of speakers and writers. —Cheryl M.

Theme identifiability indices in Spanish for a set of 70 ad hoc categorical lists,2024,10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1474494,Frontiers in Psychology,Verónica Benítez; María Ángeles Alonso Rodríguez,"The field of false memories has been widely studied in cognitive psychology through the DRM paradigm (Deese, 1959;Roediger & McDermott, 1995), an experimental task used to induce false memories from materials that are conceptually and semantically related. This paradigm involves presenting lists of words that are semantically related to a non-presented critical word, with a subsequent memory test showing high levels of false recall and false recognition of that non-studied critical word. For example, after studying a list containing words, such as ""butter"", ""food"" and ""sandwich"", it is likely that in a subsequent free recall or recognition test, the word ""bread"" will be mistakenly identified as studied.False memory is generated, in part, by the relationship between the list words and the critical word (Gallo, 2010;Roediger & Gallo, 2016). This phenomenon has been explained by two theories: the fuzzy-trace theory (FTT) (Brainerd & Reyna, 1998), and the activationmonitoring framework (AMF) (Roediger et al., 2001). Both theories agree that, understanding the production of false memories requires considering two complementary processes: an error inflation process, identified as gist encoding in FTT and as activation in AMF; and an error editing process, identified as monitoring in AMF and as recollection rejection in FTT (Brainerd & Reyna, 2002).According to FTT (Brainerd & Reyna, 1998), ""gist"" refers to the general theme extracted from studied material. When a list of words related to a non-presented critical word is studied, both literal and semantic information are encoded. In a subsequent memory test, these literal and semantic memory traces operate simultaneously, providing information about the items. The retrieval of semantic information may lead to considering the critical word as having been studied due to its similarity to the presented words. However, the retrieval of literal information about the studied associates can counteract this effect by providing evidence that the critical word was not studied, a process known as recollection rejection (Brainerd & Reyna, 2002).According to the AMF (Roediger et al., 2001), two processes work together to produce false memory: activation and monitoring. Studying a list of words can trigger activation that spreads through the lexical-semantic system, creating implicit associations between interconnected words. This activation is moderated by a subsequent monitoring process that helps distinguishing between correct recall (studied words) and false memories (non-studied words).Even when considering different perspectives, both FTT and AMF agree that presenting a list of associates words activates a non-presented critical word, leading to error inflation. If the error inflation process is not accompanied by its corresponding error editing process, or if this process fails, false recall or false recognition may occur (Arndt & Gould, 2006). Therefore, studying the strategies used to avoid false memories is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying their formation.Theme identifiability of a list is one of the essential factors involved in this error editing process (Carneiro et al., 2009). In their normative study in Portuguese, they provided theme identifiability norms for 40 DRM associative lists selected from Albuquerque's (2005) study. Participants were presented with the lists and asked to generate a word that best described the general theme of each list. To study the effect of this factor on the production of false memories, they selected those lists with the highest and lowest levels of theme identifiability. The results showed that lists with high identifiability of the critical word as the theme produced lower levels of false recall and false recognition compared to lists where the critical word was not as easily identifiable. According to Carneiro et al. (2012), this outcome was attributed to an error editing strategy called ""Identify to reject,"" which involves several stages: detecting that all the words in a list are related to a common theme, identifying the word that best describes the theme but is not present in the list, keeping it in mind to avoid recalling it in the future, and consequently, reducing false memories. This pattern has been observed in other studies using lists with an associative structure (Beato et al., 2023;Carneiro & Fernandez, 2013;Carneiro et al., 2012). Additionally, there are other normative studies that provide theme identifiability indices for associative lists in Spanish (Beato & Cadavid, 2016) and in English (Neuschatz et al., 2003).Most studies on false memories and error editing mechanisms using the DRM paradigm employ lists with an associative structure. However, ad hoc categorical relationships are less explored in the literature. Ad hoc categories are spontaneously constructed to achieve a specific goal in a given context, and their elements can come from different taxonomic categories (e.g., ""Things that can fall on your head"") (Barsalou, 1983). Both common and ad hoc categories can lead to similar memory distortions. While false memories are typically more pronounced for common categories, they are still robust for ad hoc categories (Soro et al., 2017).The mechanisms for avoiding memory distortions in such lists are not well understood. Ad hoc categories provide a valuable tool for studying situated concept representations, which are characterized by their flexibility and dynamism (Barsalou, 2005). Their use allows researchers to explore how individuals organize and retrieve information when categories are not predefined but emerge from context. This is particularly relevant for understanding how memory adapts to new information and situations, adding depth to theoretical debates on flexible concept representation.In the study with associative lists by Carneiro et al. (2009), the percentages of identification for critical words ranged from 1% to 77%. However, Soro et al. (2017) indicate that, unlike associative lists, in ad hoc categorical structured lists, theme identification typically refers to identifying the category label rather than the critical word itself. They used two criteria: exact identifiability, where participants identified the original theme of the lists (e.g., ""Materials that cover the ground"" for the category ""Things that can be walked upon""), and comprehensive identifiability, where participants identified a theme that could include the critical word (e.g., a label that includes the critical word ""grass"" for ""Things that can be walked upon""). Both criteria are important for describing our findings.To our knowledge, no previous studies have addressed false memories or theme identification with ad hoc categories in Spanish. Therefore, the aim of this research was to obtain theme identifiability indices for 70 lists that maintained ad hoc categorical relationships with a non-presented critical word using the DRM paradigm. These lists were created based on a normative study of ad hoc categories conducted in Spanish, which, to our knowledge, is the first of its kind in this language. Additionally, this research aims to lay the groundwork for studying the underlying mechanisms of error editing processes in lists with ad hoc categorical relationships in Spanish.In future research, these data may help in understanding the role of theme identifiability in the formation of false memories. Moreover, having these indices will enable more accurate predictions and better control over the experimental materials.A total of 188 students from the Psychology degree program at the University of La Laguna participated. All participants were native Spanish speakers (146 women, 42 men; mean age= 20.14, SD = 2.94).The material consisted of 70 ad hoc categorical lists, each containing 10 words. Both the critical words and their corresponding associates were extracted from a normative study conducted to collect data on ad hoc categories in Spanish (Alonso et al., in preparation;Benítez, Alonso, Fernandez, & Díez, 2022). Ad hoc categories were selected from various normative studies in English and Portuguese and then translated into Spanish (Barsalou, 1982(Barsalou,, 1983(Barsalou,, 1985;;Hough & Pierce, 1989;Soro & Ferreira, 2017;Vallée-Tourangeau et al., 1998;van Overschelde et al., 2004). The general procedure used in the Spanish normative study was similar to that used by Battig & Montague (1969), with the exception that in the present study both the presentation of the material and the collection for responses were done by computer (see van Overschelde et al., 2004). The participants were instructed to generate as many exemplars as possible for each category within one minute. This study, currently in preparation, will provide indices of frequency, rank, and lexical availability for the exemplars of each category.The lists were constructed based on the frequencies obtained from the normative study. Critical words were selected as those with the highest frequency within each category, while their associates were the next most frequent words. Care was taken to ensure that the critical words did not appear in more than one list and that no associate was repeated across lists. The selected critical words were primarily nouns (with only 4 being verbs and 1 adjective), ranging from 1 to 5 syllables, with a mean frequency of occurrence in Spanish of 60.86 per million (Alonso et al., 2011).The 70 lists were divided into 5 blocks: 4 blocks containing 15 lists each and 1 block with 10 lists. For the theme identification test, a booklet was prepared with several pages. The first page collected participant information (name, age, gender, and degree). The second page included practice examples to familiarize participants with the task. The remaining pages were dedicated to the experimental lists. Each page displayed the list number and had three blank spaces for participants to write the word or words they believed identified the theme of the list (up to three), along with a Likert scale to indicate their confidence in whether the word given in the first position represented the list's theme. Procedure Data collection took place in November 2023 during group sessions, each consisting of approximately 35 participants and lasting around 30 minutes. Each group studied 15 lists, except for one group that studied only 10 lists. The order of list presentation within each group was randomly determined.Participants began by completing the demographic information on the first page of the booklet and then received instructions similar to those used in previous studies (Carneiro et al., 2009;Neuschatz et al., 2003). They were shown a series of lists in a PowerPoint presentation, with one word displayed every 2 seconds. Before the start of the experimental session, and to ensure participants fully understood the task, two practice trials were conducted. These trials involved the same task as the main session: following the presentation of each list, participants had 50 seconds to generate up to three words that they believed best described the theme of the list. They also provided a confidence judgment on how certain they were that the first word given represented the list's theme, using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (""not very confident"") to 5 (""very confident"").Before each list, a message appeared on the screen indicating the list number to be presented. The process of presenting the list and identifying the theme was repeated until the experimental session was complete.The spreadsheet file accompanying this report (Theme_Identifiability_Ad_hoc_Spanish.xls) consists of five sheets. The first sheet, ""Theme identifiability"", contains the raw data for each participant. It includes the 70 critical words and their respective lists of 10 ad hoc associates. The first column shows the participant number, the second column identifies the list, the third column specifies the type of relationship of the lists (ad hoc), and the fourth column indicates the type of word (studied vs. critical). The fifth column contains the words themselves, while the sixth column provides the English translations of the critical and studied words. Adjacent columns include all responses provided by participants in the first, second, and third positions, as well as the confidence judgements related to the first response. Additionally, intrusions are noted-i.e., words from a study list that a participant mistakenly identified as the theme of that list, and therefore are not considered valid responses.The second sheet, ""First word"", summarizes the total count of responses given in the first position for each list. It includes all the words generated by participants as the theme in the first position, associated with their respective critical word and list number. Additionally, it provides the English translation of the critical word, the total number of participants who responded to each list, the number and percentage of participants who identified a word as the theme, and the mean confidence judgement for each first-word response. Intrusions are also noted, including quantity and incorrectly identified words.The third and fourth sheets, ""Second word"" and ""Third word"", respectively, are dedicated to responses given in the second and third positions. The layout is identical to the previous sheets, but it does not include the column for mean confidence judgement. The fifth sheet, ""Summary,"" presents the final summary, showing the most frequently identified theme for the first, second, and third positions for each list.Responses recorded in the database were maintained in their original format, with corrections made only for spelling errors. Singular/plural and masculine/feminine forms of words were counted separately.Table 1, available as supplementary material, shows the 70 critical words with their corresponding list identifier and English translation, the number of participants who responded to each list, the number of different themes given as the first response, the percentage of participants who indicated the critical word (comprehensive identification) as the theme of the list in the first position, and the mean confidence rating for the critical word as the first response. Additionally, it provides the percentages of participants who identified the ad hoc category label (exact identification) in the first position, as well as the mean confidence rating for these first-position responses.Theme identifiability is a crucial factor in the error editing process and thus influences the formation of false memories (Carneiro et al., 2009;Soro et al., 2017). However, the study of false memories in ad hoc categorical lists and the factors contributing to their formation remain unexplored in Spanish. Therefore, this study aimed to provide theme identifiability indices for 70 ad hoc lists within the framework of the DRM paradigm in Spanish.When examining identifiability levels using the same approach as in studies with associative lists (Carneiro et al., 2009), where the critical word is considered as the theme, the levels of identifiability are relatively low. Regarding comprehensive identifiability, the critical word was identified as a theme in the first position in only 10 out of the 70 lists, with identification percentages ranging from 2.1% to 17.2%. On average, the critical word was identified as the theme 0.98% (SD=3.11) of the time in the first position across all 70 lists. When considering only where the critical word was identified, this average increased to 6.88% (SD=5.39), with a mean confidence rating of 3.57 (SD=1.29). Given the ad hoc category exemplars can come from different categories, their membership is not immediately apparent without context, making the activation of the critical word challenging.In contrast, exact identifiability showed higher levels of identification. The theme of 59 lists (ranging from 2.1% to 87.5%) was identified in the first position, demonstrating a significant increase in identification compared to when only the critical word was considered. Participants often generated words that, while not precisely matching the category labels, were related to them, suggesting some thematic processing even if not explicitly expressed. On average, the theme was identified 22.22% (SD=23.75) of the time in the first position across all 70 lists. When considering only the lists where the theme was identified, this average rose to 26.36% (SD=23.67), with a mean confidence rating of 3.98 (SD=0.70) for the first response.According to Carneiro et al. (2009), in associative lists, the level of identification of the critical word as the theme is inversely related to the occurrence of false memories. Identifying the critical word as the theme triggers an error editing process that mitigates false memories in subsequent memory tests. However, this assumption may not hold true for categorical lists, particularly ad hoc categorical lists, where theme identifiability might not exert the same effect on the error editing process. Soro et al. (2017) suggested that for false memories to occur with ad hoc categories, a positive relationship with theme identifiability might be necessary due to the inherent variability among exemplars. Their study found no correlation between false recognition and theme identifiability. Instead, false recognition was influenced more by individual factors such as experience or creative thinking. Some participants generated more associations between exemplars, leading to an increased likelihood of errors in a subsequent recognition test.Our results suggest that context plays a fundamental role in theme identification within ad hoc categories, particularly concerning comprehensive identifiability. Therefore, considering the findings of Soro et al. (2017), the participant's ability to integrate exemplars into an appropriate context may significantly influence the activation of critical words. This aligns with the notion that memory is a dynamic process shaped by contextual factors (Barsalou, 2005).The present study provides valuable data on theme identifiability for a wide range of ad hoc categorical lists, underscoring the need for a different approach when studying error editing processes in this context. Our findings reveal a crucial aspect of ad hoc categories: while traditional associative lists tend to exhibit reduced false memories due to clearer theme identifiability, the inherent variability and contextual emergence of ad hoc categories introduce complexities in memory retrieval that merit further investigation. This area represents a promising opportunity for advancing our understanding of false memories.","['False memory', 'Recall', 'Psychology', 'Free recall', 'Natural language processing', 'Cognitive
