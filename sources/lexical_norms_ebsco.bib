Abstract = {It has recently been argued (for instance by Sanford Goldberg, expanding on earlier work by Tyler Burge) that public linguistic norms are implicated in the epistemology of testimony by way of underwriting the reliability of language comprehension. This paper argues that linguistic normativity, as such, makes no explanatory contribution to the epistemology of testimony, but instead emerges naturally out of a collective effort to maintain language as a reliable medium for the dissemination of knowledge. Consequently, the epistemologies of testimony and language comprehension are deeply intertwined from the start, and there is no room for grounding the one in terms of the other.

Abstract = {In psychology, lexical norms related to the semantic properties of words, such as concreteness and valence, are important research resources. Collecting such norms by asking judges to rate the words is very time consuming, which strongly limits the number of words that compose them. In the present article, we present a technique for estimating lexical norms based on the latent semantic analysis of a corpus. The analyses conducted emphasize the technique’s effectiveness for several semantic dimensions. In addition to the extension of norms, this technique can be used to check human ratings to identify words for which the rating is very different from the corpus-based estimate.

Abstract = {In the present study, we collected valence, arousal, concreteness, familiarity, imageability, and context availability ratings for a total of 1,100 Chinese words. The ratings for all variables were collected with 9-point Likert scales. We tested the reliability of the present database by comparing it to the extant Chinese Affective Word System, and performed split-half correlations for all six variables. We then evaluated the relationships between all variables. Regarding the affective variables, we found a typical quadratic relation between valence and arousal, in line with previous findings. Likewise, significant correlations were found between the semantic variables. Importantly, we explored the relationships between ratings for the affective variables (i.e., valence and arousal) and concreteness ratings, suggesting that valence and arousal ratings can predict concreteness ratings.

Abstract = {What happens when a new social convention replaces an old one? While the possible forces favoring norm change--such as institutions or committed activists--have been identified for a long time, little is known about how a population adopts a new convention, due to the difficulties of finding representative data. Here, we address this issue by looking at changes that occurred to 2,541 orthographic and lexical norms in English and Spanish through the analysis of a large corpora of books published between the years 1800 and 2008. We detect three markedly distinct patterns in the data, depending on whether the behavioral change results from the action of a formal institution, an informal authority, or a spontaneous process of unregulated evolution. We propose a simple evolutionary model able to capture all of the observed behaviors, and we show that it reproduces quantitatively the empirical data. This work identifies general mechanisms of norm change, and we anticipate that it will be of)},

The test (Profiles of Early Expressive Phonological Skills ("PEEPS"), Williams & Stoel-Gammon, in preparation) differs from currently available assessments in that age of acquisition, based on lexical norms from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Developmental Inventories, served as the primary criterion for creating a word list. Phonetic and semantic properties of the words were also considered in selecting items for the test. Productions of words using the "PEEPS" protocol have been gathered from a group of children with typical development and another group with cleft lip and/or palate. By 24 months of age, the children with typical development produced more than 90% of the target words and the children with atypical development produced 73% of the words. Regarding administration, the time needed for administering the protocol decreased with age. (Contains 4 tables.)},

Abstract = {This paper explores young children’s and parents’ use of color words and animal names in two published studies. The aim is to compare the ranges and kinds of these words in parent-child interaction and to consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of early lexical development. Color term data were drawn from the Gleason corpus in CHILDES: 12 boys and 12 girls ranging in age from 25-62 months, and their parents. Results showed that parents used and emphasized only the same 10 most basic colors, with many teaching episodes. Parents’ most frequent terms, red, blue, and green were also children’s most frequent terms and are the ones acquired earliest according to MacArthur Bates lexical norms. In the second study CLAN programs were used to identify animal names in corpora from a variety of families in CHILDES, with 44 children ranging in age from 1;6-6;2. Children and parents produced a remarkable number and range of animal terms, with individual preschoolers naming as many as 96 different, often rare, animals, such as crocodile and pelican. Parents and children thus attend to the same limited set of basic color terms. By contrast, biophilia, our shared human love of the living world is reflected in children’s extensive animal lexicon.

Abstract = {In this study we present some semantic-lexical norms concerning 'fruit' collected from normal subjects. Modelling semantic fluency needs norms for all the given exemplars: at least for Italian language, only a few of them are available. The category 'fruit' is composed of a limited number of exemplars, and some subcategories can be singled out. On a preliminary fluency task, 84 different fruits were produced, and a further normal sample provided ratings for familiarity, prototypicality and their age of acquisition. Moreover the semantic proximity between each pair of the 32 most frequent exemplars was collected and a cluster analysis has been carried out in order to yield an empirical partition of 'fruit' into different subgroups of exemplars. Besides the main models of fluency tasks, some possible advantages offered by these norms in the study of brain-damaged subjects are discussed on the basis of real data obtained from two normal subjects.

For each variable, we obtained high split-half reliabilities within each sample and high correlations between samples. In addition, the valence ratings of a previous, more limited study (Hermans & De Houwer, Psychologica Belgica, 34:115-139, ) correlated highly with those of the present study.

Abstract = {The design of experimental tasks in psychology and linguistics requires using stimulus with properties and characteristics in standardized values. This allows predicting with higher accuracy the impact of the stimulus presentation. The lexical associative norms are instruments that determine the strength of association between two concepts. The most common method to construct these norms is to take a free response from a presentation of a cue word. The main goal of this study was to construct lexical associative norms of 407 Spanish words. 800 students from Ciudad de Córdoba, Argentina, participated in the study. Quantitative analyses were performed taking into account the number of valid answers, blank and non valid answers, and number of associates per item. A qualitative classification was performed according to the strength of association. Additionally, it is presented a group of psycholinguistic indexes for a better description of the items used. Correlation analysis demonstrated a strong and negative relation between the frequency of first and second associations and the number of associations per item. This study pretends to be highly useful in research in psychology and linguistic where it is required consulting the norms presented to the design of evaluation instruments.
