Abstract = {The present study features speech errors Italian students make in translation as the most complex form of speech activity. The examined speech errors were made by both students at the Higher School of Translation and budding traslators. The low quality of technical translation and the large number of translation errors determined the scope of the present research: to draw the scientists’ attention to the problem in question, to generalize the translation practice, and to work out recommendations on preventing translation errors. The research employed general scientific methods (generalization, analysis, synthesis) and empirical research methods. The author puts forward some possible causes of error making, e.g. interlingual and cross-language interference, loan translations, etc. The author gives examples of the most typical student errors, indicates the specific reasons behind them, and offers recommendations for error prevention. The results of this study can be used for training an)},

By asking participants to discuss the seriousness of each breach, we not only identify and discuss some of these linguistic norms, but also describe important differences between the ways in which mathematicians and students understand them.

Abstract = {We integrate recent findings from the linguistics literature with the organizational justice literature to examine how the language used to encode justice violations influences fairness perceptions. The study focused on the use of non-agentive syntax to encode mistakes in Spanish ('The vase was broken') versus using agentive syntax in English ('She broke the vase') influences event fairness perceptions. We hypothesized that when justice violations are encoded using Spanish, because the non-agentive syntax makes the responsible party less salient, the event would be perceived as less unfair. In Study 1 (n = 111), English-speaking participants rated the fairness of an event in which a mistake was made and an employee received a negative outcome. They rated it as more unfair (p < .01, η² = .06) when the scenario was presented in agentive syntax. Experiment 2 (n = 70) used native English- and Spanish-speakers who watched a video of manager making a mistake. We found that Spanish-speakers used less agentive syntax (p < .01, η² = .21), perceived the event as less unfair (p < .001, η² = .23), and were more willing to help the manager who made the mistake. In Experiment 3 (n = 101) we replicated this effect controlling for cross-cultural differences and native language; further, we found an interaction between entity fairness (event vs. entity) and native language (Spanish vs. English) on citizenship intentions (p < .01, η² = .08). These results extend our understanding of how language may influence relevant workplace attitudes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {In our paper, we take a constructivist approach to early forms of ‘academic language’, based on a conversation analytic framework. Adopting an interactional linguistic framework that is based on ethnomethodological and conversation analytic theoretical thinking, we aim to describe the social and linguistic norms that emerge in so-called ‘morning circles’, a highly ritualised interactional routine that transfers part of the interactional responsibility to the children and at the same time teaches the prerequisites for specific communicative practices. As morning circles are turned into language teaching lessons on a regular basis, we describe the linguistic features that emerge as learning objects, and some of the learning practices in which they are embedded. We will argue that language learning practices are situated practices, connecting the use of linguistic forms with ideologies of linguistic and social appropriateness. Our analysis is based on video recordings of three sessions in a first grade class in a primary school in a medium sized town in Germany, which have been transcribed and qualitatively analysed.

Abstract = {Many recent studies, academic and non-academic alike, have argued that the use of Urdu in Bollywood has started to decline. These studies, important as they are, however, suffer from some limitations. They are either impressionistic or based on non-representative data. Furthermore, they do not specify the object of the study or the site of the assumed decline of Urdu. Therefore, it remains vague which element of Urdu, for example sounds, words, syntax or script is under investigation. Similarly, it is not clear which component of film for example titles, dialogues or songs are experiencing the decline. Fulfilling this research gap this paper makes two contributions. Analyzing songs from 1959 to 2010’s, it empirically demonstrates the decline by documenting the shift in the pronunciation of the sounds /kh̲/, /gh̲/, and /q/ from the Urdu to Hindi phonetic norms. Singers from the 1990’s, unlike those from the previous generations, merge them with the sounds /kh/, /gh/, and /q/. The paper)},

Abstract = {The authors documented a linguistic norm account of direction of comparison asymmetry effects in relational judgments (e.g., seeing hyenas as more similar to dogs than dogs are similar to hyenas). The asymmetry effect is magnified by discrepancies in prominence between subject and reference, and has previously been explained using A. Tversky's (1977) feature-matching model. Given a linguistic norm to place more prominent objects in the referent position, violation of this norm might reduce sentence clarity, which then weakens the magnitude of subsequent relational judgments. 53 undergraduates completed a study that tested the degree to which both clarity and feature-matching predicted the magnitude of relational judgments by construction in 3 regression models, on for each of the 3 types of relation statements: similarity, difference, and spatial relation. Clarity perceptions predict the magnitude of relational judgments independently of the cognitive manipulation of the features of the compared objects. The pattern of findings suggests that a linguistic norm interpretation may account for variance in relational judgments independently of Tversky's feature-matching model.

Abstract = {This study aims at exploring new norms as to the textual additions in parentheses (=TAiPs) in the translation of a Quranic text as writer-oriented devices of textuality. Coding for this sort of information could be useful in establishing an impact on any decision-making process on the TL version; such TAiPs can give a translated text of the Quran unity and purpose and distinguish it from a disconnected sequence of sentences. Six small-sized chapters of the Quran were selected as a research sample including a number of four handred forty two (442) TAiPs. Two writer-oriented kinds of textuality were found: "cohesivity" at the levels of grammar and lexis to be in form of recurrence, reference, substitution, ellipsis and conjunction; and "relationality" by coherence and intentionality to be in form of reiteration, collocation, connotation, evocation and interpretation. The study is a detailed analysis of such a severely criticized yet officially approved English interpretation of the Quran as the Hilali and Khan Translation (=HKT) against a predetermined set of text-linguistic norms. The strength or weakness of TAiPs as to how they might alleviate or aggravate the TL version is eventually identified for sake of improvement.},

Orthography was considered as the reflection of an individual's idiomatic correctness or incorrectness, where the principal traits of Hispanic American phonetics could be observed, and the definite condemnation of the non-observance of its rules is motivated by social redemption and national progress support. The reorganization and simplification of the alphabetic corpus aims at smoothing the teaching of writing with orthographic regularity, and under the ruling of the pronunciation principle some changes are justified by that form that is felt characteristic, in Sarmiento sometimes with arguments to strengthen orthography as an identifying link with Americanity.

Consequently, the epistemologies of testimony and language comprehension are deeply intertwined from the start, and there is no room for grounding the one in terms of the other.

So the existence of an apparently rule-governed practice entails the existence of, what I call, a policing practice. I then argue that this entailment cannot be reconciled with a non-factualist construal of the policing practice. Thus non-factualism about the policing practice is false. Factualism about the policing practice entails realism about rules. So I conclude that we ought to be realists about rules. Finally I distinguish a position which I call ultra-realism about rules and note that this too is a casualty of the view developed here.

Abstract = {The ways in which literacy in English is taught in school generally subscribe to and perpetuate the notion of a homogenous, unvaried  set of writing conventions associated with the language they represent,  especially in relation to spelling and punctuation as well as grammar. Such  teaching also perpetuates the myth that there is one "correct" way of  language use which is "fixed" and invariant, and that any deviation is at best  "incorrect" or "illiterate" and at worst, a threat to social stability. It is also  very clear that the linguistic norms associated with standard English are  predicated upon and replicate white, cultural hegemony. Yet, at the same  time, there are plenty of literary and creative works written by authors from  all kinds of different cultural, ethnic and linguistic backgrounds, including  canonical ones, where spelling and punctuation are varied and championed  as a sign of creativity. In the world beyond school, pupils are also surrounded by variational use of written language, especially in public displays such as shop signs, writing on mugs and t-shirts, posters, graffiti and so on, which link language to place. Equally, the voices we hear in entertainment and public broadcasting, far from being homogenous, celebrate diversity in Englishes. The homes and backgrounds of pupils in our schools, including their linguistic backgrounds, may also be very different either in terms of a different variation of English or languages spoken other than English. Since the emphasis is usually upon "correct" and "fixed" ways of teaching writing in English, it has often been difficult for teachers and pupils to reconcile the kind of English taught in school as the "correct" way and thus, by definition,all others as "incorrect." However, narrow definitions of linguistic "correctness" are becoming increasingly difficult to uphold given that the public spaces with which we are surrounded are peppered by examples of variational use in writing. Recent sociolinguistic research into variation points to an increasing fluidity of linguistic use, especially when it comes to public displays of writing, particularly in media such as newspapers, websites, shop signs, TV channel logos and so on. Linguistic variability can thus be seen as a resource in creating unique voices and marking allegiance to, for example, a particular place and culture. Such research is indicative of the fact that variational use of English, far from being "incorrect" or "illiterate", is increasingly being drawn upon creatively to mark a place identity. It also points to a shift in our conceptual thinking about language(s) and varieties from being perceived as static, "fixed", totalised and immobile to being thought of as dynamic, fragmented and mobile, with the focus upon mobile resources rather than immobile languages. At the same time, the teaching of literacy centres upon the teaching of linguistic norms of spelling and grammar as "fixed." There is a tension then, between creative expression of linguistic use often linked to place and those linked to standard English. This article explores those tensions and discusses the implications and possibilities for the teaching of English and literacy.},

Firstly, we have provided a short presentation of some improbable etymologic solutions suggested so far, together with some critical remarks. Subsequently, we have presented a detailed analysis of the existing etymologic hypothesis: a) the anthroponym-based etymology (Iaş); b) the ethnonym-based etymology (ias/ iasi 'Alan/ Alans'). Linguists only mention the first hypothesis as a possibility. However, it has been embraced by certain historians and turned into a probability, although it lacks both historic (the first attestation of the anthroponym Iaş is late,)},

Working from the theoretical background of dynamic bilingualism, a translanguaging lens posits that bilingual learners draw on a holistic linguistic repertoire to make sense of the world and to communicate effectively with texts. What is relatively underdeveloped is the pedagogical aspects of translanguaging. This classroom-based study conducted in the southeastern US asks 2 questions: (a) How might teachers create a translanguaging space for students, and (b) what would this space look like? The authors, 1 classroom teacher and 1 researcher, engaged emergent bilingual students in small group reading of a culturally relevant text and observed students' active participation through strategic and fluid translanguaging practices. The authors argue that the linguistic norms of schooling should reflect the discursive norms of emergent bilingual students, and that teachers create translanguaging spaces as a path to educational equity.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the issues with current systems of categorisation and measurement of linguistic metaphoricity, which have coloured most research into the area to-date. The paper discusses the role of metaphor as a form of creative language and a deviation from more linguistic norms and conventionalities. Two current theories are discussed as providing alternatives to metaphor identification approaches. These are Hanks' ("Int J Lexicogr" 17:3, 2004) Theory of Norms and Exploitations and Hoey's (Lexical priming and the properties of text, 2003) Theory of Lexical Priming. It is proposed that the theory of lexical priming can be adopted to provide an explanation of linguistic norms and exploitations involved in metaphoric language. Finally, the paper provides a brief corpus analysis of the verb "to kindle" found in a corpus of Nineteenth Century writings. The analysis will focus upon evidence of linguistic and secondary meaning primings within concordance lines.},

Abstract = {Italian unification aimed to ‘make Italian women’, as an equally important and complementary goal to that of forging men ‘of character’, worthy of being citizens of the new Italian nation. In the process of nation-building, women were entrusted with an essential role as educators and for this reason were subject to standardizing pressure by the cultural industry. There was a marked growth in the number of series of novels which served to instil moral and linguistic norms. The serial nature of these publications, the stereotypical social roles they depicted, and the paradigmatic nature of their stories — all transmitted in an accessible, Tuscanized Italian — ensured that a uniform model was presented to unmarried and married women. This article provides an analysis of a representative corpus of various genres of novel (e.g. moral novels, protest novels, romances) which reveals how women evolved from being passive and silent readers to authors of female-centred but not feminist novels, )},

Abstract = {Despite the global spread of English, it seems that voices from nonnative English teachers concerning English as an international language (EIL) are under-represented. To address the issue, this study sought to investigate the nonnative teachers' perceptions of idealized native-speaker linguistic and pragmatic norms in the EIL context. Participants included 125 nonnative English-speaking teachers from the Persian context, falling within the expanding circle. Questionnaires and interviews were used to explore the teachers' perceptions of native-speaker norms. Findings showed that the nonnative teachers gave preference to native-speaker linguistic norms despite the emerging nonnative EIL norms. Although most of the teachers accepted the existence of a number of accents in English, they preferred the standard American or British accent for language education. As to EIL pragmatic norms, the teachers argued that some degree of flexibility is acceptable with regard to the use of L1 pragmatic norms in the EIL context. The EFL teachers in the present study maintained that the transfer of L1 pragmatic norms to the nativized English makes English a legitimate and culturally appropriate variety in communication between nonnative speakers. The findings contribute to the reappraisal of ELT practices and the premises underpinning teaching EIL.},

Abstract = {Relations between perceiving and knowing are well-worn problems that become visceral encounters with doubt and ambiguity in 'mixed-reality' environments. Locative narrative situates participants within stories where existent places function as the setting. Experiential confusion, between what is talked of as real and as imagined, is an often-reported phenomenon. Classical pragmatisms, and more broadly the writings of William James, understand the functioning of the body to be for the production of action, from which flows a naturalistic epistemology. for James, a thought's reference to an object occurs in the medium of an 'experienceable environment' and is a condition of it being known; what something is known-as is how it functions in a particular context and the consequences that follow. Contemporary pragmatists express varying positions on the function of representation in perception at different levels of cognitive awareness, and the extent to which intentionality is derivative o)},

Abstract = {Arabic linguists put their efforts to set up grammatical rules following the process of collecting lingustic data from the ancient Arabic tribes. While doing this, they had attached great importance to encompassing Arabic language as a whole by those grammatical rules. They had frequently referred to the linguistic usage of Arabic tribes in both determination and deduction periods within the above-mentioned boundaries. Some of the tribes that linguists had referred to were accepted as worthy of attention as a consequence of their geographical status. In this study, we examined the place of the dialect of Tamim which was considered as one of the most important tribes in terms of carrying value in induction activity for Arabic grammatical rules. From this perspective, we dealt with the term "dialects" as a phenomenon and the reason why they have arisen as well as the sources employed by the linguists in the process of pescribing linguistic norms.

Abstract = {This article deals with two parenthetical word combinations. Reflections on the place parenthetical constructions occupy in modern Russian may be found in direct statements of people writing on the Internet. Recently, both in colloquial Russian and in the language of Internet forums we have seen substantial changes in the expressions chosen for parenthetical constructions and in the functions of these constructions as a whole. For example, constructions such as na minutocku and stesnjajus' sprosit' are now used as parentheticals. The paper analyses meanings and usages of these two particular phrases. In some cases they point to the speaker's intention of being over-obliging and considerate of the interlocutor, while in other cases they reveal the author's ironical stance. Most interesting, however, are the cases where these constructions form part of a rhetorical technique aimed at suppressing the interlocutor by means of demonstrating one's own superiority.

Abstract = {This article characterizes aspect-perception as a distinct form of judgment in Kant's sense: a distinct way in which the mind contacts world and applies concepts. First, aspect-perception involves a mode of thinking about things apart from any established routine of conceptualizing them. It is thus a form of concept application that is essentially reflection about language. Second, this mode of reflection has an experiential, sometimes perceptual, element: in aspect-perception, that is, we experience meanings-bodies of norms. Third, aspect-perception can be "preparatory": it may help us to decide what linguistic norms to develop and how to conceptualize-make the world thinkable. Fourth, the article discusses the forms of justification for which aspect-perception allows-the necessity and normativity involved in employing this form of judgment.

Abstract = {In contemporary South Korean society, there is a strong emphasis on cultural homogeneity and, simultaneously, the development of English proficiency as a human resource. Since language is inextricably linked to identity, bilingual learners from English speaking countries may feel pressure to conform to Korean cultural and linguistic norms, leading to negative identity practices that discourage the use of English. Like the "model minority" stereotype which has been assigned to Asian learners in the United States, the pervasive belief that learners from English speaking countries are highly proficient in English may have adverse effects on students who do not meet the conceptualized standard. To explore educational problems associated with the English-Korean bilingual learner, a case study was conducted on an American-Korean elementary school student. Results revealed that the learner avoided speaking English in public, learning English in formal contexts, and talking about American ethnic traditions, which has resulted in significant deficiencies in English pronunciation and literacy. The avoidance of explicit instruction appears to have precluded the development of cognitive and metacognitive strategies useful in overcoming language deficiencies in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. Recommendations for educational reform have been suggested.},

To deepen our understanding of the unique characteristics of HL and FL populations, this investigation examines: (1) how HL learners' language learning goals, perceptions of language proficiency and learning needs, and habits of language use distinguish them from those of their English-speaking FL counterparts, and (2) how FL and HL students' perceptions of (and attitudes toward) Spanish implicitly or explicitly reflect attitudes expressed in the classroom and elsewhere. This mixed-methods study explores and compares the perceptions and experiences of 109 university-level HL students and 138 FL students as reported in survey responses and ethnographic interviews. Socio-affective variables distinguishing HL and FL groups include attitudes toward Spanish, judgments of linguistic norms, learners' efforts to achieve legitimacy as users of Spanish, and obstacles to interaction, including anxiety and social inhibition. Quantitative and qualitative analyses depict participants' self-images as fragile users of Spanish, with many characterizations paralleling instructor and peer perceptions.},

Abstract = {This theoretical paper discusses different linguistic theories that have dealt (or in some cases: not dealt) with how situated utterances are built in natural language: What is the role of abstract systems of linguistic norms or impersonal brain mechanisms? Can individual speakers make decisions about their own utterances? In this paper some traditional, structuralist, interactionist and dialogist theories are mutually contrasted. Starting out from a dialogist framework, a notion of participatory agency will be developed, based on the fact that speakers' situated languaging occurs in various activity types in direct or indirect interaction with others . Recent theories of interbodily dynamics, or intercorporeality, are discussed. A version of extended dialogism is proposed.

Abstract = {This paper develops the ethical and political proposal created by the American philosopher Judith Butler from the critical concept livable world. The implicit question into this writing is: who cannot fully inhabit the social world? The first section explains what Butler does mean as a livable life, and also what unlivable life means. In the second, the last problem is studied in terms of language livability. After an ethical exam of the performative theory of language it is shown how, after the failure of repeated linguistic norms, agency appears, and unlivable lives get the capacity for action and can signify in a different way the terms that oppress them. The conclusion shows how Butler's critical ethics radicalize democracy doing the necessary questions to make the world a more livable place.

Abstract = {The attitude that we should have towards linguistic norm should not be the same in all professional fields. A speech and language therapist (language rehabilitation, speech and altered voice professional), must have an attitude towards different norm which a teacher must adopt. In this study, we have used a survey as a research instrument to ask active speech and language therapists a series of questions on what linguistic norms do they use as reference in their rehabilitative work. Thus, we focus our study on linguistic system notions against standard norm, with a methodology based on selected opinion surveys to elucidate the adopted attitude during speech therapy intervention. Consequently, we have collected speech therapists surveys from various linguistic communities that do not share the same language model to observe which language variant do they use as a basis of their interventions.

For Italian speakers who learn Spanish in the sociocultural context where the language is spoken, the structural similarities between their mother language and the target language hinder the learning of these verbal tenses, because the perception of minimum distance allows the commutation of the linguistic systems of both languages.

Both sides of this problematic will be considered in order to exemplify the ways that we switch from one language to another (in our case the French and Romanian languages) and the problems that rise in the process of oral and written discourses. The question is also to insist on the mediums that translators have at their disposal and the differences and convergences that exist between some of these persons. The use of translation and interpreting as mediums to accede to the universe of another language and of other people is also emphasized, so as to understand better how difficult it is, on one hand, and how it contributed to make very great progress in various fields, over the time and from one continent to another.

Abstract = {Since the late 1800s, the Uruguayan Government has attempted to enforce cultural and linguistic norms along the border with Brazil through the prohibition of Portuguese, especially in schools, despite the fact that this is the heritage language of most border residents. This research focuses on the differential use of Spanish and Portuguese in Rivera, the largest city on the border. Using self-reported data and metalinguistic commentaries extracted from interviews with 63 Spanish–Portuguese bilinguals, the use of both languages in various domains (home, school, work spaces) and with diverse interlocutors (family, friends, co-workers, superiors) is analyzed. Quantitative and qualitative analysis reveals that Portuguese, which has been marginalized for decades, is more frequently used in the home with relatives and close friends. The use of Portuguese in more formal domains, including schools, is much less frequent. The results from this study corroborate a perception within the community that Portuguese lacks the prestige of Spanish and provide further evidence of its status as a primarily home language. The current research does not show a progressive shift toward Spanish in Rivera nor does it support claims by other researchers that this community is diglossic.

From a theoretical standpoint, I tell self-consciously disobedient-to-norms writing (that can be considered a political statement) from simply improper writing (that signals ignorance of such norms). I argue that, given the lack of training in academic writing in the course of most college careers, such ignorance should not come as a surprise. Both as a political statement and as a symptom of ignorance of linguistic norms and from an epistemologically antirealist standpoint, I argue that since theories (and, therefore, the world as something scientifically conceivable and actually conceived) exist within and through academic writing, every effort towards proper writing is valuable. Finally, I list and discuss 30 usual mistakes taken from the casuistry that I have gathered over the years and from books on normative talk and writing. (Engli)},

Abstract = {David Walker’s famous 1829 Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World expresses a puzzle at the very outset. What are we to make of the use of “Citizens” in the title given the denial of political rights to African Americans? This essay argues that the pamphlet relies on the cultural and linguistic norms associated with the term appeal in order to call into existence the political standing of black folks. Walker’s use of citizen does not need to rely on a recognitive legal relationship precisely because it is the practice of judging that illuminates one’s political, indeed, citizenly standing. Properly understood, the Appeal aspires to transform blacks and whites, and when it informs the prophetic dimension of the text, it tilts the entire pamphlet in a democratic direction. This is the political power of the pamphlet; it exemplifies the call-and-response logic of democratic self-governance.

Abstract = {Using Australian languages as examples, cultural selection is shown to shape linguistic structure through invisible hand processes that pattern the unintended outcomes (structures in the system of shared linguistic norms) of intentional actions (particular utterances by individual agents). Examples of the emergence of culturally patterned structure through use are drawn from various levels: the semantics of the lexicon, grammaticalized kin-related categories, and culture-specific organizations of sociolinguistic diversity, such as moiety lects, "mother-in-law" registers, and triangular kin terms. These phenomena result from a complex of diachronic processes that adapt linguistic structures to culture-specific concepts and practices, such as ritualization and phonetic reduction of frequently used sequences, the input of shared cultural knowledge into pragmatic interpretation, semanticization of originally context-dependent inferences, and the input of linguistic ideologies into the sys)},

Abstract = {Inviting Citizen Designers to Design Learning Management System (LMS) Interfaces for Student Agency in a Digital Cross-Cultural Contact Zone assesses how FYC students from periphery cultural and linguistic backgrounds perceive Blackboard Learn and other learning management system (LMS) interfaces. The report of an empirical study shows that the current LMS design does not provide writing students in general and writing students from periphery cultural and linguistic backgrounds in particular an opportunity of a higher-level interactivity with the LMS. The current design neither includes periphery students' cultural and linguistic norms and values, nor does it allow them to affect the existing design through their design activities. These LMSs are currently constraining users from higher-level interactions. As a result, writing students have to act as the LMS ask them to do, and they remain passive in these platforms. Based on the web usability test responses, this study proposes to invite Citizen Designers, writing students from periphery cultural and linguistic backgrounds, to design LMS interfaces to enhance user activities and transform them into cross-cultural platforms. This study analyzes interface designs by Citizen Designers to see how designers acquire their agency in a cross-cultural digital contact zone. This study concludes that Citizen Designers' participation in interface design helps them create favorable electronic environments that help them acquire their agency and enhance their (digital) writings and researches.

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is two-fold: first, to explore the role played by linguistic and cultural factors in the mathematics classroom, particularly in relation to diverse learners; and, second, to provide insight into teaching, learning, and professional development that takes into account current mathematics education reform recommendations. In this article, the authors explore and discuss four selected cultural and linguistic factors to consider when teaching mathematics to diverse students. These four major topics, while broad and complex, do collectively create a perspective that values what students bring to the mathematics classroom. More specifically, this instructional perspective considers the strengths that students with diverse language and cultural backgrounds bring to a mathematical environment. These include different ways of representing, speaking, and thinking about mathematical ideas and skills. Teachers not privy to the various cultural and linguistic norms which ground these mathematical dispositions may have difficulty engaging students in mathematical conversations--the centerpiece of current mathematics education reform. The discussion provides suggestions and specific instructional approaches encouraging teachers to view cultural and linguistic diversity as a strength in the teaching and learning of mathematics.},

Abstract = {This paper tries to give answers for successful receptive multilingualism (RM) but also for its failure. It is mainly based on the results of two projects, one on inter-dialectal communication in the Baltic area during the era of the Hanseatic League and the other analyses inter-Scandinavian communication today. The main purpose of this survey is to outline the essential preconditions for successful RM, from a linguistic, social and environmental perspective. The historical project about communication in the Baltic focuses on long-term language contact based on common mutual trading interests whilst the contemporary project highlights the cultural factors (among others Pan-Scandinavism) as a common basis for using one's own mother tongue in transnational communication. Moreover, other relevant issues belonging to successful RM are touched upon, such as diglossia (i.e. the functional distribution of different languages/varieties in various settings), oral face-to-face communication, the absence of written norms and the non-existence of standardised forms, which result not only in a greater flexibility in communication but also support openness for divergent varieties. Disfavouring factors for RM are, however, taken into consideration as well, such as nationalism and the suppression of minorities (and thus indirectly multilingualism), the enforcement of strict linguistic norms by the society and finally the use of a lingua franca such as Latin in the Middle Ages or English today.},

Separate norms are available for three age groups: 6–8 years (1st and 2nd grade), 9–10 years (3rd and 4th grade), and 11–12 years (5th and 6th grade). Moreover, childLex is directly comparable to the DWDS corpus, a large corpus for adults’ print language. Here, we describe how childLex was collected and analyzed and compare frequency norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level with frequency norms obtained from the DWDS corpus. Results show moderate levels of correspondence in the high-frequency range and on the sub-lexical level, but strong discrepancies for medium- and low-frequency elements on the lexical and super-lexical level. Finally, we illustrate which variables are available in childLex and how they can be retrieved using a web interface. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Linguistic research on the classroom behavior of school children has often shown that there is a tension between the development of an anti-authoritarian peer culture and the pressure to do well academically and behave in ways that meet adult approval. This tension is particularly strong for boys. In this context, violating the linguistic norms of the classroom is one way of rebelling and constructing a masculine identity which can gain peer approval. The rebellious and playful identities of the boys in this study are at times in conflict with their desire to be productive and high-achieving. In this study of an English Mother Tongue classroom in a German-American bilingual school in Berlin, Germany, five boys are faced with this dilemma. One tactic used by some of the boys to resolve the conflict is the use of Mock NSE. The use of Mock NSE by these boys is a salient socio-pragmatic device for indicating how they wish to be identified. These boys thus make use of the classroom norm of speaking Standard English by flouting it, creating new and multiple identities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This paper discusses research on the English of Mexican Americans, arguing that in focusing primarily on description of vernacular Chicano English, the literature describing English spoken by Mexican Americans presents an incomplete picture of the complexity of their linguistic situation. Researchers may lose sight of the range of linguistic behaviors found within the Mexican American community, or even within a single family, where it is not uncommon to find fluent Spanish speakers, speakers with limited Spanish proficiency, and speakers of both nonstandard and standard dialects of English. The paper examines the range of linguistic behaviors found within three generations of a primarily English-dominant, middle class Mexican American family. It finds that even within this  close-knit group of speakers, there exist distinct linguistic norms, ranging from those associated more closely with Chicano English to those associated with standard English. Even those speakers who make use of few if any linguistic resources associated with Chicano English or Spanish distinguish themselves linguistically from non-Mexican Americans. The paper considers the conscious and unconscious linguistic choices made by the speakers to be acts of identity, suggesting that the linguistic behaviors described are important means of constructing aspects of their social identities.

Abstract = {While numerous studies on bilingual education have looked at student test scores, drop-out rates, and parental responses, this study looks at the attitudes of the students directly affected by bilingual education. Interviews with a representative sample of 132 elementary school students (grades 4-6) in El Paso, Texas were conducted for this study. Investigating the behaviors and attitudes of children with respect to language use should provide insight into changing linguistic norms of this border community. Questions were designed to elicit students' attitudes toward Spanish and English as well as determine their public and private use of these languages for a variety of purposes and contexts, in addition to eliciting information concerning their sociodemographic and academic  background. The bulk of this paper consists of reporting the statistical details of how the students answered numerous questions about their language use preferences, level of proficiency, and feelings about the Spanish language.

Abstract = {The critical role first aid responders, relief workers, and other medical personnel play in crisis and disaster settings cannot be understated. Especially in conflict areas, medical personnel face numerous threats to their security and physical well-being, putting them at risk of developing psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Because lay medics frequently function as the primary health providers in low-resource conflict situations, their mental health is crucial to the delivery of services to afflicted populations. In this chapter we examine the experiences of community health workers who serve displaced and war-affected populations in Karen State, eastern Burma. The evidence presented is based on the authors' previous qualitative research with this population. Though it is impossible to neatly deconstruct the myriad experiences of suffering, perseverance, and survivorship intrinsic to these medics' lives into the academic frameworks of psychology and psychiatry, an attempt at finding patterns in their narratives that parallel concepts in mental health literature may be helpful in developing evidence-based interventions. Incongruities are implicit in generalizations, and constant awareness of cultural relativism among widely different societal and linguistic norms must be maintained.

Abstract = {This study investigated language transfer, particularly in the realm of pragmatics, in a native Korean-speaking student of advanced Japanese. A series of tasks including a verbal report were used to elicit Japanese production and comprehension data. Results indicate that the learner drew heavily on his native language in completing the tasks, but that in pragmatic areas of language his performance deviated from generally accepted linguistic norms to a greater degree than his overall language proficiency would indicate. It is concluded that although language transfer helps learners attain a high level of global proficiency in a closely-related target language, it may be less effective in helping them attain a similar level of pragmatic competence in that language. This suggests  that metapragmatic knowledge and affective variables may have a greater influence on development of pragmatic competence than they do on the development of other areas of target-language competence.

Abstract = {Graduate students have long expressed difficulties adapting to different expectations graduate schools place upon them. Foreign students pursuing knowledge in the field of speech communication encounter cultural difficulties. Foreign graduate students are students at risk because they become a central locus for cultural tensions in relation to: (1) educational systems and values; (2) sociocultural and linguistic norms appropriate for graduate programs of study; and (3) ways these students construct and reconstruct their identities. Comparing and contrasting educational views from back home becomes a serious tension for graduate students at risk. Language also has a powerful impact on modalities in which these students establish themselves as competent scholars. Another cultural  tension refers to assessing levels of appropriateness and significance for responses in class discussion and written form. Grading criteria is yet another. Sociocultural interpretations of interactions with faculty and peers, ability to negotiate confrontation on specific issues, and possible misinterpretation of socially acceptable behaviors represent sources of stress. Redefining or reconstructing an individual's cultural identity in another cultural context presents another challenge. To what extent does stress due to cultural tensions remain with these foreign graduate students after they have accomplished their goals of professionalism? How can they overcome perceived cultural barriers and gain confidence? By studying how the stressful journey of graduate programs offers accounts of  intercultural communication, this line of research can illustrate even more significantly the necessity of intercultural communication for a global perspective of the 21st century.

Poirier, Boivin, Trepanier & Verreault 1994 gave us the first general overview of the French linguistic legacy in North America. Valdman and his team have updated that work, incorporating the findings of sociolinguistic research carried out over the past decade, notably in language obsolescence. The result is comprehensive treatment of all the main areas of North America where French is spoken. It is well organized, with an introductory chapter providing a succinct overview of the four sections to follow: The first describes where, how, and to what extent French is spoken in North America; the second examines language variation in each of these areas and the effects of language contact; the third looks at linguistic norms and language planning; and a fourth is devoted to more general comparative and historical issues. It is possible to point to improvements that could have been incorporated into the volume. There are occasional production blemishes. However, this volume offers an invaluable tool not only for students of French but also for sociolinguists concerned with the effects of language contact, language change, and language obsolescence.

Abstract = {This paper examines the sociolinguistic situation of a multilingual secondary school in the Barcelona metropolitan area and examines the language practices of both students and educators. Following a critical sociolinguistic ethnography perspective, it understands practices as constructing the socio-institutional order of the school, and language as constitutive of social processes. The analysis of the data shows that the students, the majority of which are of migrant background, systematically fail to employ Catalan, the language of schooling, and that the teachers refuse to enforce official linguistic norms. Rather than considering it exclusively a language issue, we claim that language is an index of a process of constructing the school as 'different' and the school body as non-academic. In the analysis of discourses and practices, social class emerges as one of the grounding motivations for such 'difference', which leads to low academic demands, a life skills educational perspective, and lack of competence in Catalan, with serious consequences for students’ social access.

Abstract = {A study analyzed patterns of usage of political vocabulary in Hong Kong English as found in newspaper reports of a leading Hong Kong English-medium newspaper and two other English-medium newspapers. Data were drawn from a computerized corpus and a clippings file. The report begins with an overview of the theoretical basis of the study of ideology in the lexicon of English as a world language. The second section discusses Hong Kong's sociopolitical situation and some themes in official political discourse. Finally, the processes through which some of these themes are embedded in Hong Kong English are examined. Eight categories of vocabulary that exemplify two processes in the transformation of ideology into lexis (naming and metaphor) are identified: nominalization; naming by  analogy; "hollow" or neutral names that conceal a document or institution's real function; re-lexicalization, or giving a new name when it is claimed a new concept is at issue; mythical actors (e.g.,"average man"); fixed collocations; intertextual reference; and strategies used to dissociate the writer from his text. It is concluded that the vocabulary used does not accurately reflect cultural and linguistic norms of the indigenous population, but is closely related to colonial ideologies. (MSE)},

The role of quotations in the OED, as the evidential basis for the dictionary, is briefly considered, along with eighteenth-century (and Victorian/Edwardian) views on women and language, and the availability of female-authored texts for quotation by the lexicographers. The article reports sample reading in eighteenth-century female writers (especially Jean Adam, Penelope Aubin and Anna Seward), which shows that OED could easily have supplied its eighteenth-century deficiency from such authors, and that it often favoured distinctive usages in female-authored texts—innovative, eccen)},

@masterthesis{ED53312920110101,
Abstract = {The institutionalization of separate standard varieties for Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian in the 1990s was hailed by many Bosnians as the long-denied recognition of the Bosnian idiom as distinct from the Serbian and Croatian varieties it had so often been subordinated under. Yet the accompanying codification of Bosnian standard language forms has been highly controversial in Bosnia, and debates continue today about how to define the Bosnian language. My dissertation explores the paradox that while many Bosnians support the Bosnian language as a name , they often do not support it as a norm .    To explore this paradox, I undertook 12 months of fieldwork in four different middle schools in Bosnia. Education is a domain in which linguistic norms are highlighted. In Bosnia, it is also an area in which language variation is deemed to be particularly problematic by observers, participants, and commentators both locally and abroad. The decentralized nature of education in Bosnia means that classrooms are often ethnically segregated and curricula in use across the country are not harmonized.    Language standardization has often been analyzed as a state-sponsored process that works through official institutions to reduce heterogeneity and promote uniform understandings of linguistic forms and their semiotic meanings. This dissertation explores ongoing language standardization campaigns in Bosnia and Herzegovina and argues that traditional ways of understanding the role of institutions in language standardization don't explain why standardization has been so unsuccessful in the post-war Bosnian state. My research challenges the idea that institutions must be engaged in drawing rigid us/them boundaries to be thought of as representative or legitimate, instead pointing to the possibility that ambiguity can be a marker of legitimacy rather than a threat to it.    This dissertation explores how ideologies of heterogeneity and free choice in language work against the imposition of a standard norm at the same time as European aspirations and ideas about post-socialist normalcy push many Bosnians to believe their country should have such a standard. The resulting tension is the space in which choice between standard variants takes on social meaning and contributes to emerging definitions of what it means to be Bosnian.

Abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to the current debate on "interculturality" (IC) by investigating the process of language socialization whereby different generations of diasporic families negotiate, construct, and renew their sociocultural values and identities through interaction. Focusing on the use of address terms and "talk about social, cultural, and linguistic practice," the paper argues that IC is not only a dynamic process through which participants make aspects of their multiple and shifting identities relevant, but also a process of developing new social and cultural identities. In effect, it serves as a direct means of language socialization for the younger generation who are developing their sociocultural roles and learning about the social and cultural appropriateness of behavior in a diasporic context, where there are potentially substantial differences in social and cultural values between the wider local community and the diasporic community. Language socialization is regarded in this study as not simply about passing social and cultural values from one generation to another, but about "bringing about" changes in social and cultural values. Through language socialization, the younger generations of diasporic communities not only internalize the social, cultural and linguistic norms of their community, but also play an active role in constructing and creating their own social and cultural identities as well as bringing about changes to the existing community and family norms.

Abstract = {This book offers an exciting new perspective on the origins of language. Language is conceptualized as a collective invention, on the model of writing or the wheel, and the book places social and cultural dynamics at the centre of its evolution: language emerged and further developed in human communities already suffused with meaning and communication, mimesis, ritual, song and dance, coparenting, new divisions of labour, and revolutionary changes in social relations. The book thus challenges assumptions about the causal relations between genes, capacities, social communication, and innovation: the biological capacities are taken to evolve incrementally on the basis of cognitive plasticity, in a process that recruits previous adaptations and fine-tunes them to serve novel communicative ends. Topics include the ability brought about by language to tell lies, which must have confronted our ancestors with new problems of public trust; the dynamics of social-cognitive co-evolution; the role of gesture and mimesis in linguistic communication; studies of how monkeys and apes express their feelings or thoughts; play, laughter, dance, song, ritual, and other social displays among extant hunter-gatherers; the social nature of language acquisition and innovation; normativity and the emergence of linguistic norms; the interaction of language and emotions; and novel perspectives on the timeframe for language evolution. The contributors are leading international scholars from linguistics, anthropology, paleontology, primatology, psychology, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence, archaeology, and cognitive science.

Abstract = {This paper examines the ideologies and practices surrounding respect at a Korean American heritage language school in California. It illustrates the interaction between locally circulating metadiscourses about children's dispositions, intentions, and identities and the enforcement of classroom norms of respect. In some cases, teachers accommodated to children's linguistic norms though a metadiscourse that reframed the indexicality of potentially disrespectful behavior. In other cases, forms of bodily demeanor were naturalized as indexical of children's deliberate communication of disrespect. Teachers' classroom narratives presented theories of affective accommodation and affective display, where respect for a teacher's feelings was supposed to be given priority over respect for a child's feelings, but children did not always comply with these theories. By illustrating how teachers' metapragmatic ideologies about children's identities as Korean Americans, contexts of language acquisition, and linguistic needs mediate the interactional construction of (dis)respect, this paper demonstrates the hybrid/multidirectional nature of language socialization.

Abstract = {TESOL declares that it is a global organization. TESOL's expansionist ambitions dovetail with U.S. corporate and government global aims. This trend leads the author to conclude that even if U.S. TESOL were to more actively embrace the other languages of its emerging bilinguals, the languages of a more multilingual TESOL would still be hierarchically ordered. "Globalizing" English is incompatible with balanced multilingualism--though this is not (yet?) the case where English is relatively successfully learned as a foreign language in Europe, and where U.S. TESOL is virtually unknown. There is currently a widespread concern that European languages are experiencing "domain loss," in research publication, in higher education, business, and international relations. This is a real risk, but the term itself is inappropriate because it conceals agency. When English supplants another language, what happens is that users of English (whether as a first or second language) accumulate linguistic capital and others are dispossessed of their languages, their territory, and their functions. Analysis of such processes can be strengthened by distinguishing between the project, processes, and products. The promotion of "global" English is a "project" (making English the default language internationally and increasingly intranationally), for which the "processes" tend to be normalized and legitimated by political, scholarly, and educational cheerleaders (inappropriate advocacy and pedagogy), which serve to consolidate "products" (Anglo-U.S. linguistic norms, with local variation). Linguistic capital dispossession, which subtractive language learning or use promotes, means that English takes over space that earlier was occupied by the national language or the mother tongue. The author contends that what is therefore needed as a more ethical alternative is international English "projects" that strike a sustainable balance between English and other languages, through "processes" that lead to multilingual competence. Additive English for specific purposes is desirable, provided English learning and use are situated in local multilingual ecologies. There is an urgent need for professional rethinking and for the political will to address such language policy issues. (Contains 4 footnotes.)},

Abstract = {This paper argues that the "world Englishes paradigm" and English as a lingua franca (ELF) research, despite important differences, have much in common. Both share the pluricentric assumption that "English" belongs to all those who use it, and both are concerned with the sociolinguistic, socio-psychological, and applied linguistic implications of this assumption. For example, issues of language contact, variation and change, linguistic norms and their acceptance, ownership of the language, and expression of social identities are central to both WE and ELF research. The growing body of descriptive ELF research that is now becoming available can thus add substance to work in the field as a whole. It can also offer fresh perspectives on several theoretical constructs central to WE, such as "community", "variety", "lingua franca", even "language".},

Abstract = {The article proposes a reading of two novels by Evgenij Popov (b. 1946), Nakanune nakanune (1993) and Podlinnaja istorija «Zelenych muzykantov» (1999), as a response to 'the language question' in post-perestroika Russian culture and society. The heterogeneous linguistic landscape of Nakanune - a remake of Turgenev's classic Nakanune - is compared to the 'theoretical' reflections on language and style found in the numerous footnotes contained in Podlinnaja istorija. The comparative view opens up for a discussion of two principal types of metalanguage and the differences and interactions between them: explicit commentary on language and linguistic reflexivity through linguistic practice. For the latter, I propose the term 'performative metalanguage', and point to the numerous ways in which linguistic norms and styles may be negotiated, challenged and commented on through the linguistic practice, and in combination with straightforward commentary.

Abstract = {The language of a speech community can only act as an identity marker for all of its speakers if linguistic norms are widely shared and if a minimal number of language varieties are spoken. This article examines briefly how a linguistic norm came to serve the whole of Iceland and how a situation of relative linguistic homogeneity was maintained for centuries. Sociolinguistic theory tells us that the speech community that we can reconstruct for early Iceland should lead to the establishment and maintenance of local norms. However, Iceland, arguably monodialectal, was certainly characterized by long-term linguistic homogeneity and remained a society where nucleated settlements barely formed over a thousand-year period. Scholars have argued that a mixture of dialects leveled shortly after the settlement of Iceland in the ninth century (Settlement). Studies show that dialect leveling requires dialect mixing, the convergence of people on one place, and sustained linguistic contact between )},

Abstract = {The present study explores how minority schoolchildren in multilingual peer group interactions act upon dominant educational and linguistic ideologies as they organize their everyday emerging peer culture. The data draw from ethnographies combined with detailed analysis (CA) of video recordings in two primary monolingual school settings in Sweden. Bakhtin's processual view of how linguistic norms are used for overcoming the heteroglossia of language is used as a framework for understanding how monolingualism is talked-into-being in multilingual peer groups. As will be demonstrated, the children recurrently participate in corrective practices in which they playfully exploit multiple linguistic resources (syntactic, lexical and phonetic features) and the turn structure of varied activities (conflicts, accusations, insults, classroom discourse) to play with and consolidate a collective critical view of not-knowing correct Swedish. Moreover, they transform faulty talk (repeating structura)},

The analyses reveal a striking inconsistency between intralingual subtitling practice in fiction versus non-fiction programs.

As such, subtitling practice subtly reflects the existence of shifting linguistic norms in Flanders.

And one of the most crucial sites where this identity construction takes place is in working groups (which often form communities of practice). Over time, these groups may develop a shared repertoire of linguistic norms on which members regularly draw when interacting with each other. Drawing on over 40h of authentic discourse data, this paper illustrates how three leaders construct their professional identities by using teasing humour in ways that exploit the specific discursive norms that characterise their respective working groups. Teasing comprises a valuable component of the linguistic repertoire negotiated among group members. This discourse strategy not only constitutes a prime means for identity construction but also assists the leaders in achieving their various workplace objectives.

Abstract = {This paper investigates the ways languages are used in Philadelphia Chinatown through qualitative content analysis of 330 photos. Examining the linguistic landscape of public spaces exposes issues of linguistic tensions, language vitality, and language shift in multilingual settings. While Chinese in the form of Mandarin is highly publicized, thereby placing disproportionate emphasis upon one language over others, Philadelphia Chinatown shows diversity, coexistence, and creative uses of multiple Chinese languages alongside English. The signage suggests linguistic rescaling connecting real and imagined audiences, conforming to broader 'Chinese' linguistic norms while localized to connect to a range of Chineses. We show how linguistic and cultural pluralism of 'Chinese' have always existed—and continue to exist—and the importance of developing socially sensitive literacy pedagogy, especially when there is a mismatch between the informal, community-level signage and what is formally taught in 'Chinese' language classrooms in the U.S. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Conversation is one of the poetical and cultural key concepts in the writings of Mme de Staël. Departing from the contemporary understanding of the term, she outlines the conversational act as an essentially transgressive praxis that surpasses a classical canon of social, aesthetic, and linguistic norms. Highlighting a broad variety of musical, sensual, and pre-semantic aspects of language, she insists on the informal dynamics of conversation. To a certain extent, Mme de Staël claims, all conversation is improvisation, and it is within improvisation that she locates (and welcomes) the trigger of unsuspected twists and turns, the spirited, the emphatic, and even drunken quality of verbal and non-verbal exchange. The paper discusses the development of this concept in Mme de Staël's major novel, Corinne ou I'Italie. It argues that this novel is one of the first to delineate conversation as transference, shifting the focus of attention from the realm of intentionality to non-thematic qual)},

The research also examines linguistic features that contribute to the social judgments. Results show a correlation between the perception of African American identity and judgments that occur in other areas; the consultants value AAVE as their heritage language, but see standard African American English as the one variety that can meet the demands of all environments.

Abstract = {This chapter discusses community context as a necessary precondition for examining Black Language in white public space. Just as economic institutions are gentrifying and removing Black communities around the nation and offering unfulfilled promises of economic independence, one can also say that educational institutions have been attempting to gentrify and remove Black Language from its speakers with similarly unfulfilled promises of economic mobility. Most Blacks in the U.S. since integration can testify that they have experienced teachers' attempts to eradicate their language and linguistic practices in favor of the adoption of white cultural and linguistic norms. The chapter also discusses Black Language as a complex system, of structure and use that is distinct from White Mainstream English (WME) in the U.S. While it is true that Black Language shares much of its structure with WME, there are many aspects of the Black Language syntactic and phonological systems that mark it as distinct from that variety. The racial segregation present in U.S. society has led some scholars to use the term American apartheid to describe the deliberate isolation and exclusion of Blacks from educational, occupational and social institutions in the U.S.},

Language is a major resource in the creation of our gendered sense of self, with styles stereotypically associated with male and female. The linguistic culture of the group has stereotypical 'male' and 'female' aspects. The language of the therapist is critical in establishing linguistic norms, challenging or reinforcing gender stereotypes. The movement from these stereotypical styles, with the ability to draw upon both 'male' and 'female' characteristics, is a therapeutic movement. The absence of critical analysis of these aspects of language and gender in group theory witnesses to the power of the 'social unconscious'.

The sociolinguistics of mobility unites several disparate threads in my own research. First, immigration represents extreme mobility, and societies with profuse immigration differ in partly predictable ways linguistically and culturally from those with little or no immigration. Second, dialect acquisition by the children of newcomers provides new perspectives on critical period effects and influences, including the Ethan Experience, in which the nativization of children is abetted by their imperception of foreign-accent features in their parents’ speech. Third, identification of relatively recently-arrived people from other dialect regions allows comparisons of their linguistic norms with the communal norms, and a measure of their linguistic influence.

Abstract = {The investigation described in this paper was concerned with language alternation (code-switching) in the speech of Chicano migrant workers in Florida. In order to study Chicano bilingualsim, three principal sources were utilized: (1) a revised version of Wolck's sociolinguistic background questionnaire; (2) pictorial questionnaires such as Sapon's Pictorial Linguistic Interview Manual and pictures taken from newspapers, magazines, and the Sear's catalogue; and (3) relaxed conversational situations between bilinguals, taped by residents of the migrant camps. The specific purpose of the research was to observe the use of unassimilated loanwords which were phonologically English, but which were used in the Spanish of 33 informants. It was found that the vast majority of informants  did not rely on direct English borrowings. If they borrowed any lexical items at all, they tended to assimilate them into their Spanish. They were aware of the linguistic norms of at least one of the two languages and they were sensitive to the separate identity of Spanish and English. Three sample conversations are presented, followed by an analysis of the various causes for the language switching in each. Educators should recognize the differences between Chicanos who switch from Spanish to English because they cannot distinguish the two languages, or from an inability to recall Spanish lexical items, and those who use language switching deliberately in order to convey additional affective meaning. The habit of the latter group should be recognized as an assertion of their dual cultural  heritage. (CFM)},

Abstract = {This is a reflection on certain aspects of sociolinguistic and linguistic problems of French in West Africa, particularly in Senegal and the Ivory Coast. The sociolinguistic section discusses the role French has played in Africa and still plays vis-a-vis African languages and English. Conditions in which French is used and attitudes both of individual speakers of French toward that language and attitudes of social groups who might use it are discussed. In addition to these two topics, the following are also presented: (1) a typology of linguistic situations that includes contacts among the native languages themselves and contacts between native languages and English and French; (2) general considerations on varieties of French; (3) a discussion of linguistic norms and  interference and of the relationship between norm and interference; and (4) an outline of varieties of French spoken in Africa as found in various authors. The second part of this study dealing with linguistic aspects of French as spoken in West Africa discusses: (1) the characteristics of varieties of French in Africa; (2) whether the varieties of French are dialects or different languages; (3) the character of popular French in West Africa; and (4) contact between the Akan languages and French on the Ivory Coast. The appendix contains transcriptions of narratives in French recorded by Africans. (AMH)},

A Bayesian simulation is constructed of people interacting and using probits to compare their rankings of alternatives to estimate the subjective probability i.) that others have the same tastes as them, and ii.), for each alternative, that this alternative is their best choice. These simulations are found to, at least simplistically, resemble a type of illusory correlation which gained increased prominence in the United States from 1930 to 1960, and earlier in the United Kingdom when queer panics conflated "predatory" and "traitorous" with lesbian/gay. This modeling of the social articulation of preferences leads to conjectures on the role of Michel Foucault's épistémè (1972), Barbara Ponse's principle of consistency (1978), Jeffrey Escoffier's master code (1985), Sandra Bem's schema (1981), John R. Searle's Background (1990, 1992,)},

Abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in regional variation within African American English. This study reviews a work done on local speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, discussing trends for both African American and White ethnic groups. Just as scholars have found in other geographic regions, in Pittsburgh, African Americans and Whites share a number of feature characteristics of the local dialect, but remain distinct in a number of other ways. Research in Pittsburgh, as elsewhere, highlights the complexity, rather than the homogeneity, of African American speech across the country, as speakers exhibit alignment to both regional and supraregional ethnic linguistic norms.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, A Better Pencil: Readers, Writers, and the Digital Revolution by Dennis Baron (2009). This book addresses the impact of digital technologies on reading and writing practices by contextualizing these developments within the communication technologies that have preceded them. Though computers are often blamed for a perceived deterioration of culture and language, Baron notes that scorn and mistrust of communication technologies is not a new phenomenon; in fact, writing, the printing press, and the telegraph were all greeted at first with skepticism. And despite the pervasive anxiety that 'internet speech' is resulting in the destruction of grammar and spelling, Baron observes that online communities enforce their own linguistic norms. Rather than a linguistic free-for-all, Baron argues, 'spelling counts' in virtual spaces just as it does offline. In sum, Baron accounts for both the benefits and pitfalls of the digital revolution and analyzes it as merely another set of technological innovations, usefully situating them within a history of writing technologies.

Abstract = {Language can serve as a potent and injurious tool against ambitious women in the workplace. Consider how often both men and women have thought or said 'bitch' or other derogatory terms when describing a woman in a leadership position. Freud once described mental health as the ability to love and to work. For many of these women, their work has also become their love, their passion. Working long hours, often working 'twice as hard as men,' to be viewed as equally competent, perhaps sacrificing spouse and children in deference to career, these women have been inculcated into a patriarchal corporate environment, one in which they must act in a sexual dissonant manner in order to succeed. And as they negotiate the male managerial model, they often come to view their own femininity in an objectified, disparaging way. They may defeminize their language and adopt a 'more adversarial, information-focused style characteristic of all male talk'. Here is where the dilemma begins: If they conform to the masculine linguistic norms of the corporate environment, then their behavior can be perceived as confrontational, harsh, contentious, un-lady-like. A collision of culture ensues on intrapsychic and interpersonal levels between what is expected of a woman in society and what is expected of a person in a high status position where valued leadership traits are male-gendered. Often these women select language and styles that veer away from the feminine side of the gender spectrum. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reply by the current authors to the review by Constant Leung (see record [rid]2008-09991-006[/rid]) on the original book, Language testing: The social dimension (2006). Leung has drawn attention to possibly the most obvious gap in our treatment: a properly elaborated discussion of the assessment of English as a lingua franca. While consideration of this issue has begun in the work of authors he cites in his review, and elsewhere, it is, as Leung points out, a multiply complex issue, in which the social dimension is the crux of the problem, ‘in terms of speaker subject positions, lexicogrammatical norms, transcultural pragmatic conventions and so on’. It is clear that language testing—particularly significant here as a site of authority about linguistic norms, not unlike a dictionary—has an important role to play in authorizing or de-authorizing English as a lingua franca communication as a proper target for language learning; a further demonstration, if one were needed, of the power of tests. But beyond this political and institutional dimension, the psychometric problems inherent in designing tests based on a construct that is local, situated, and fluid pose a difficult but productive challenge to testers.

Abstract = {It is important that a book on adolescence should contain a chapter on slang and swearing because these are two features of adolescent linguistic behavior that attract more attention than they perhaps warrant, symbolizing as they do, the freedom that young people have at this stage of their lives to challenge linguistic norms, and at the same time to test interpersonal bonds and institutional constraints with their parents as they seek to establish new identities and relationships within their changing worlds. This chapter will start by providing a brief background description of the linguistic characteristics of slang and swearing before moving to a more focused discussion of why (although such language is also commonly used by many adult groups who find themselves living in close proximity in institutionalized contexts such as prisons or military camps), it may be particularly typical of adolescent speech. Subsequent sections of the chapter explore how the use of slang and expletives by young people can be viewed as a means of building cultural capital within their networks, while at the same time establishing boundaries between new adolescent in-groups ('us') and parents and nonmembers ('them'). A section on the use of pejorative terms further develops this theme of 'us' and 'them.' In addition, I also consider gender-based patterns of the ways young people use slang and expletives, and the subtle coercive effect such words have in regulating typical patterns of in-group behavior. Finally some suggestions are made regarding research questions that still require attention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The institutionalization of separate standard varieties for Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian in the 1990s was hailed by many Bosnians as the long-denied recognition of the Bosnian idiom as distinct from the Serbian and Croatian varieties it had so often been subordinated under. Yet the accompanying codification of Bosnian standard language forms has been highly controversial in Bosnia, and debates continue today about how to define the Bosnian language My dissertation explores the paradox that while many Bosnians support the Bosnian language as a name, they often do not support it as a norm . To explore this paradox, I undertook 12 months of fieldwork in four different middle schools in Bosnia. Education is a domain in which linguistic norms are highlighted. In Bosnia, it is also an area in which language variation is deemed to be particularly problematic by observers, participants, and commentators both locally and abroad. The decentralized nature of education in Bosnia means that classrooms are often ethnically segregated and curricula in use across the country are not harmonized. Language standardization has often been analyzed as a state-sponsored process that works through official institutions to reduce heterogeneity and promote uniform understandings of linguistic forms and their semiotic meanings. This dissertation explores ongoing language standardization campaigns in Bosnia and Herzegovina and argues that traditional ways of understanding the role of institutions in language standardization don't explain why standardization has been so unsuccessful in the post-war Bosnian state. My research challenges the idea that institutions must be engaged in drawing rigid us/them boundaries to be thought of as representative or legitimate, instead pointing to the possibility that ambiguity can be a marker of legitimacy rather than a threat to it. This dissertation explores how ideologies of heterogeneity and free choice in language work against the imposition of a standard norm at the same time as European aspirations and ideas about post-socialist normalcy push many Bosnians to believe their country should have such a standard. The resulting tension is the space in which choice between standard variants takes on social meaning and contributes to emerging definitions of what it means to be Bosnian.

Linguists have demonstrated the metaphorical or connotative significance of switching, but have not fully discussed the various forms switching takes. The present paper is the result of a careful analysis of both casual conversation speech of 33 bilingual Chicano migrant workers in Florida as well as their identifications of pictures from PLIM (Sapon: 1957) and a Sears catalogue. It intends to show how various sociolinguistic factors interact to determine switches ranging from isolated words in Spanish used out of necessity (lack of knowledge of the English word) to keenly purposeful switching  intended to convey feelings of ethnic solidarity. These sociolinguistic factors include: (1) degree of migration, (2) degree of proficiency in each language, (3) place of birth, (4) length of time in the U.S., (5) education, (6) parents' birthplace, (7) spouse's birthplace, (8) future job aspirations, (9) awareness of linguistic norms of either or both languages, (10) ability to recognize which language is being spoken.

Specifically, I look at how U.S. Latina women mark the legal record with their language and their culture. Briggs (1998) discusses how power and representation are intimately linked, and he suggests that certain parties command modalities that are authoritative, while they also limit and constrain those that are not hegemonic. The official record within the U.S. judiciary is often conceptualized as a space where people communicate in Standard American English (SAE). Several studies suggest that when speakers do not command this powerful social dialect, the legal system, in one way or another, imposes it on them.

Abstract = {A theory of linguistic behavior is presented. An integration with psychological theory, with justice to the complexities of linguistic structure, is attempted. Fundamentally, speech behavior is a series of movements in which certain uniformities can be found. Some of these uniformities are linguistic norms; others of a more psychological nature are related to conditions under which speech responses occur. The linguistic response-type is defined as any uniformity in speech behavior which exhibits a certain behavioral structure. This common behavioral structure is characterized in some detail. Employing the qualifications listed, one can separate linguistic from nonlinguistic behavior. The former includes all speech behavior as well as many nonvocal gestures. Psychological properties of linguistic response-types are to be studied in terms of their strength. Thus verbal behavior 'is seen as a series of movements patterned in overlapping units. The uniformities underlying these movements exist as behavioral habits, or response-types, the strengths of which are subject to continual change.'
