Specifically, we used a corpus of over 26,000 fiction books to show that computational models of language trained on samples of language (i.e., subcorpora) representative of the language located in a particular place and time can track differences in people’s experimental language behavior. This conclusion was true across multiple tasks (lexical decision, category production, and word familiarity) and provided insight into the influence that language experience imposes on language processing and organization.

"KeywordsCompound words Semantic transparency Psycholinguistics Morphology Bigram frequency Sentiment Family size ","ladec the large database of english compounds","The Large Database of English Compounds (LADEC) consists of over 8,000 English words that can be parsed into two constituents that are free morphemes, making it the largest existing database specifically for use in research on compound words. Both monomorphemic (e.g., wheel) and multimorphemic (e.g., teacher) constituents were used. The items were selected from a range of sources, including CELEX, the English Lexicon Project, the British Lexicon Project, the British National Corpus, and Wordnet, and were hand-coded as compounds (e.g., snowball). Participants rated each compound in terms of how predictable its meaning is from its parts, as well as the extent to which each constituent retains its meaning in the compound. In addition, we obtained linguistic characteristics that might influence compound processing (e.g., frequency, family size, and bigram frequency). To show the usefulness of the database in investigating compound processing, we conducted a number of analyses that showed that compound processing is consistently affected by semantic transparency, as well as by many of the other variables included in LADEC. We also showed that the effects of the variables associated with the two constituents are not symmetric. In short, LADEC provides the opportunity for researchers to investigate a number of questions about compounds that have not been possible to investigate in the past, due to the lack of sufficiently large and robust datasets. In addition to directly allowing researchers to test hypotheses using the information included in LADEC, the database will contribute to future compound research by allowing better stimulus selection and matching.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes"," compound words semantic transparency psycholinguistics morphology bigram frequency sentiment family size ladec large database english compounds large database english compounds ladec consists english words parsed constituents free morphemes making largest existing database specifically research compound words monomorphemic wheel multimorphemic teacher constituents items selected range sources including celex english lexicon project british lexicon project british national corpus wordnet hand coded compounds snowball participants rated compound terms predictable meaning parts extent constituent retains meaning compound addition obtained linguistic characteristics influence compound processing frequency family size bigram frequency show usefulness database investigating compound processing conducted number analyses showed compound processing consistently affected semantic transparency variables included ladec showed effects variables constituents symmetric short ladec opportunity researchers investigate number questions compounds investigate past due lack sufficiently large robust datasets addition directly allowing researchers test hypotheses information included ladec database contribute future compound research allowing stimulus selection matching ",1
"KeywordsAge of acquisition Arousal Concreteness Dominance Familiarity Imageability Valence ","lexicosemantic affective and distributional norms for 1000 dutch adjectives","The research of the word is still very much the research of the noun. Adjectives have been largely overlooked, despite being the second-largest word class in many languages and serving an important communicative function, because of the rich, nuanced qualifications they afford. Adjectives are also ideally suited to study the interface between cognition and emotion, as they naturally cover the entire range of lexicosemantic variables such as imageability (infinite–green), and affective variables such as valence (sad–happy). We illustrate this by showing how the centrality of words in the mental lexicon varies as a function of the words’ affective dimensions, using newly collected norms for 1,000 Dutch adjectives. The norms include the lexicosemantic variables age of acquisition, familiarity, concreteness, and imageability; the affective variables valence, arousal, and dominance; and a variety of distributional variables, including network statistics resulting from a large-scale word association study.

"KeywordsWord association Lexical association Association measures Word co-occurrence Corpus-derived Corpus-based Chinese text corpora ","clad a corpus derived chinese lexical association database","The application of word associations has become increasingly widespread. However, the association norms produced by traditional free association tests tend not to exceed 10,000 stimulus words, making the number of associated words too small to be representative of the overall language. In this study we used text corpora totaling over 400 million Chinese words, along with a multitude of association measures, to automatically construct a Chinese Lexical Association Database (CLAD) comprising the lexical association of over 80,000 words. Comparison of the CLAD with a database of traditional Chinese word association norms shows that word associations extracted from large text corpora are similar in strength to those elicited from free association tests but contain a much greater number of associative word pairs. Additionally, the relatively small numbers of participants involved in the creation of traditional norms result in relatively coarse scales of association measurement, whereas the differentiation of association strengths is greatly enhanced in the CLAD.

"KeywordsinfoVal Reverse correlation Classification images rcicr package R ","comment on quantifying the informational value of classification images a miscomputation of the infoval metric","Brinkman et al. (2019) recently introduced an innovative metric—infoVal—to assess the informational value of classification images (CIs) relative to a random distribution. Although this measure constitutes a valuable tool to distinguish random from nonrandom CIs, we identified two noteworthy discrepancies between the mathematical formalization of the infoVal metric and the authors’ computation. Specifically, the computation was based on the one norm instead of the Euclidean norm, and the k constant was omitted in the denominator of the ratio that produces infoVal. Accordingly, the simulations and experimental results reported by Brinkman et al. do not build on the correct infoVal computation but on a biased index. Importantly, this discrepancy in the computation affects the statistical power and Type I and error rate of the metric. Here we clarify the nature of the discrepancies in the computation and run Brinkman et al.’s Simulation 1 anew with the correct values, to illustrate their consequences. Overall, we found that relying on the miscomputed infoVal metric can lead to misguided conclusions, and we urge researchers to use the correct values.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," infoval reverse correlation classification images rcicr package comment quantifying informational classification images miscomputation infoval metric brinkman al recently introduced innovative metric infoval assess informational classification images cis relative random distribution measure constitutes valuable tool distinguish random nonrandom cis identified noteworthy discrepancies mathematical formalization infoval metric authors computation specifically computation based norm euclidean norm constant omitted denominator ratio produces infoval simulations experimental results reported brinkman al build correct infoval computation biased index importantly discrepancy computation affects statistical power type error rate metric clarify nature discrepancies computation run brinkman al simulation anew correct values illustrate consequences found relying miscomputed infoval metric lead misguided conclusions urge researchers correct values ",0

Metrics were developed from data collected during an experiment in which racially diverse participants interacted with self-resembling avatars at social events hosted in the virtual world Second Life. In the qualitative stage, the researchers conceptualized four distinct patterns of movement from overhead video recreations of participants interacting during the social events. In the quantitative stage, these patterns of movement were operationalized into metrics to reflect each type of observed interpersonal behavior. The metrics were normalized through a series of transformations, and construct validity was assessed through correlations with self-report measures of intergroup behavior. Finally, the metrics were applied to an analysis of the virtual-world study examining the influence of resource competition on racial group interactions. The findings contribute to our understanding of the influence of resource competition on Blacks’, Asians’, and Whites’ group dynamics. Applications of these metrics for the future of the psychological study of interpersonal behavior are discussed.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," dynamic spatiotemporal data group dynamics race mixed methods measurement interpersonal interactions continuous spatiotemporal data application study effects resource competition racial group interactions describe sequential qualitative quantitative mixed method procedure construct conceptually grounded quantitative metrics interpersonal behavior continuous spatiotemporal data metrics developed data collected experiment racially diverse participants interacted resembling avatars social events hosted virtual world life qualitative stage researchers conceptualized distinct patterns movement overhead video recreations participants interacting social events quantitative stage patterns movement operationalized metrics reflect type observed interpersonal behavior metrics normalized series transformations construct validity assessed correlations report measures intergroup behavior finally metrics applied analysis virtual world study examining influence resource competition racial group interactions findings contribute understanding influence resource competition blacks asians whites group dynamics applications metrics future psychological study interpersonal behavior discussed ",0
"KeywordsDiscourse technology Readability Patient education Understanding ","a theoretically motivated method for automatically evaluating texts for gist inferences","We developed a method to automatically assess texts for features that help readers produce gist inferences. Following fuzzy-trace theory, we used a procedure in which participants recalled events under gist or verbatim instructions. Applying Coh-Metrix, we analyzed written responses in order to create gist inference scores (GISs), or seven variables converted to Z scores and averaged, which assess the potential for readers to form gist inferences from observable text characteristics. Coh-Metrix measures reflect referential cohesion and deep cohesion, which increase GIS because they facilitate coherent mental representations. Conversely, word concreteness, hypernymy for nouns and verbs (specificity), and imageability decrease GIS, because they promote verbatim representations. Also, the difference between abstract verb overlap among sentences (using latent semantic analysis) and more concrete verb overlap (using WordNet) should enhance coherent gist inferences, rather than verbatim memory for specific verbs. In the first study, gist condition responses scored nearly two standard deviations higher on GIS than did the verbatim condition responses. Predictions based on GIS were confirmed in two text analysis studies of 50 scientific journal article texts and 50 news articles and editorials. Texts from the Discussion sections of psychology journal articles scored significantly higher on GIS than did texts from the Method sections of the same journal articles. News reports also scored significantly lower than editorials on the same topics from the same news outlets. GIS proved better at discriminating among texts than did alternative formulae. In a behavioral experiment with closely matched text pairs, people randomly assigned to high-GIS versions scored significantly higher on knowledge and comprehension.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," discourse technology readability patient education understanding theoretically motivated method automatically evaluating texts gist inferences developed method automatically assess texts features readers produce gist inferences fuzzy trace theory procedure participants recalled events gist verbatim instructions applying coh metrix analyzed written responses order create gist inference scores giss variables converted scores averaged assess potential readers form gist inferences observable text characteristics coh metrix measures reflect referential cohesion deep cohesion increase gis facilitate coherent mental representations conversely word concreteness hypernymy nouns verbs specificity imageability decrease gis promote verbatim representations difference abstract verb overlap sentences latent semantic analysis concrete verb overlap wordnet enhance coherent gist inferences verbatim memory specific verbs study gist condition responses scored standard deviations higher gis verbatim condition responses predictions based gis confirmed text analysis studies scientific journal article texts news articles editorials texts discussion sections psychology journal articles scored significantly higher gis texts method sections journal articles news reports scored significantly lower editorials topics news outlets gis proved discriminating texts alternative formulae behavioral experiment closely matched text pairs people randomly assigned high gis versions scored significantly higher knowledge comprehension ",0

MTurk offers advantages over traditional student subject pools, but it also has important limitations. In particular, the MTurk population is small and potentially overused, and some groups of interest to behavioral scientists are underrepresented and difficult to recruit. Here we examined whether online research panels can avoid these limitations. Specifically, we compared sample composition, data quality (measured by effect sizes, internal reliability, and attention checks), and the non-naivete of participants recruited from MTurk and Prime Panels—an aggregate of online research panels. Prime Panels participants were more diverse in age, family composition, religiosity, education, and political attitudes. Prime Panels participants also reported less exposure to classic protocols and produced larger effect sizes, but only after screening out several participants who failed a screening task.

"KeywordsResearch methods Deception Economics Psychology ","the importance of being honest evidence that deception may not pollute social science subject pools after all","Deceiving participants about the goals or content of a study is permitted in psychological research but is largely banned in economics journals and subject pools. This ban is intended to protect a public good: If experiencing deception causes participants to be suspicious in future studies, and suspicion meaningfully influences their behavior, then the entire field suffers. We report a survey of psychologists’ and economists’ attitudes toward deception (N = 568) and a large, nondeceptive multisite study in which we measured participants’ histories, suspicion levels, and behavior in four common economic tasks (N = 636). Economists reported more negative attitudes toward deceptive methods and greater support for the deception ban than did psychologists. The results of the behavioral study, however, do not support the “public good” argument for banning deception about the goals or content of a research study: Participants’ present suspicion was not clearly related to past experiences of deception, and there were no consistent behavioral differences between suspicious and credulous participants. We discuss the implications of these results for the ongoing debate regarding the acceptability of deceptive research methods.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," research methods deception economics psychology importance honest evidence deception pollute social science subject pools deceiving participants goals content study permitted psychological research largely banned economics journals subject pools ban intended protect public good experiencing deception participants suspicious future studies suspicion meaningfully influences behavior entire field suffers report survey psychologists economists attitudes deception large nondeceptive multisite study measured participants histories suspicion levels behavior common economic tasks economists reported negative attitudes deceptive methods greater support deception ban psychologists results behavioral study support public good argument banning deception goals content research study participants present suspicion related past experiences deception consistent behavioral differences suspicious credulous participants discuss implications results ongoing debate acceptability deceptive research methods ",0
"KeywordsVocal age First impressions Personality Voice space Voice database Speech corpus ","the jena speaker set jessa database of voice stimuli from unfamiliar young and old adult speakers","Here we describe the Jena Speaker Set (JESS), a free database for unfamiliar adult voice stimuli, comprising voices from 61 young (18–25 years) and 59 old (60–81 years) female and male speakers uttering various sentences, syllables, read text, semi-spontaneous speech, and vowels. Listeners rated two voice samples (short sentences) per speaker for attractiveness, likeability, two measures of distinctiveness (“deviation”-based [DEV] and “voice in the crowd”-based [VITC]), regional accent, and age. Interrater reliability was high, with Cronbach’s α between .82 and .99. Young voices were generally rated as more attractive than old voices, but particularly so when male listeners judged female voices. Moreover, young female voices were rated as more likeable than both young male and old female voices. Young voices were judged to be less distinctive than old voices according to the DEV measure, with no differences in the VITC measure. In age ratings, listeners almost perfectly discriminated young from old voices; additionally, young female voices were perceived as being younger than young male voices. Correlations between the rating dimensions above demonstrated (among other things) that DEV-based distinctiveness was strongly negatively correlated with rated attractiveness and likeability. By contrast, VITC-based distinctiveness was uncorrelated with rated attractiveness and likeability in young voices, although a moderate negative correlation was observed for old voices.

Each word is included in its original spelling as well as in a normalized form (target hypothesis), specifying the intended word form, which we corrected for orthographic but not grammatical errors. Original and target word forms are aligned character-wise and the target word forms are enriched with phonological, syllabic, and morphological information. Additionally, for each target word form, we established key lexical variables, e.g., word frequency or summed bigram frequency, as specified in childLex. Where applicable, we also specify key features of German orthography (e.g., consonant doubling, vowel-lengthening <h>).

We argue that a critical and long-overlooked factor that could underlie these diverging results is the methodological differences in the calculation of morphological variables across studies. To address the need for a common morphological database, we present MorphoLex-FR, a sizeable and freely available database with 12 variables for prefixes, roots, and suffixes for the 38,840 words of the French Lexicon Project. MorphoLex-FR constitutes a first step to render future studies addressing morphological processing in French comparable. The procedure we used for morphological segmentation and variable computation is effectively the same as that in MorphoLex, an English morphological database. This will allow for cross-linguistic comparisons of future studies in French and English that will contribute to our understanding of how morphologically complex words are processed. To validate these variables, we explored their influence on lexical decision latencies for morphologically complex nouns in a series of hierarchical regression models. The results indicated that only morphological variables related to the suffix explained lexical decision latencies. The frequency and family size of the suffix exerted facilitatory effects, whereas the percentage of more frequent words in the morphological family of the suffix was inhibitory.

"KeywordsMotion tracking Video recording Deep learning Gesture and speech analysis Multimodal language ","the quantification of gesturespeech synchrony a tutorial and validation of multimodal data acquisition using device based and video based motion tracking","There is increasing evidence that hand gestures and speech synchronize their activity on multiple dimensions and timescales. For example, gesture’s kinematic peaks (e.g., maximum speed) are coupled with prosodic markers in speech. Such coupling operates on very short timescales at the level of syllables (200 ms), and therefore requires high-resolution measurement of gesture kinematics and speech acoustics. High-resolution speech analysis is common for gesture studies, given that field’s classic ties with (psycho)linguistics. However, the field has lagged behind in the objective study of gesture kinematics (e.g., as compared to research on instrumental action). Often kinematic peaks in gesture are measured by eye, where a “moment of maximum effort” is determined by several raters. In the present article, we provide a tutorial on more efficient methods to quantify the temporal properties of gesture kinematics, in which we focus on common challenges and possible solutions that come with the complexities of studying multimodal language. We further introduce and compare, using an actual gesture dataset (392 gesture events), the performance of two video-based motion-tracking methods (deep learning vs. pixel change) against a high-performance wired motion-tracking system (Polhemus Liberty). We show that the videography methods perform well in the temporal estimation of kinematic peaks, and thus provide a cheap alternative to expensive motion-tracking systems.

"KeywordsParaphrase identification Named-entity semantic relatedness WordNet Wikipedia Word category subsumption ","a hybrid approach for paraphrase identification based on knowledge enriched semantic heuristics","In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for sentence paraphrase identification. The proposal addresses the problem of evaluating sentence-to-sentence semantic similarity when the sentences contain a set of named-entities. The essence of the proposal is to distinguish the computation of the semantic similarity of named-entity tokens from the rest of the sentence text. More specifically, this is based on the integration of word semantic similarity derived from WordNet taxonomic relations, and named-entity semantic relatedness inferred from Wikipedia entity co-occurrences and underpinned by Normalized Google Distance. In addition, the WordNet similarity measure is enriched with word part-of-speech (PoS) conversion aided with a Categorial Variation database (CatVar), which enhances the lexico-semantics of words. We validated our hybrid approach using two different datasets; Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC) and TREC-9 Question Variants. In our empirical evaluation, we showed that our system outperforms baselines and most of the related state-of-the-art systems for paraphrase detection. We also conducted a misidentification analysis to disclose the primary sources of our system errors.

"KeywordsArabic language Arabic language resources Arabic NLP Semtic morphology Root-and-pattern model Pattern-and-root model Finite state transducers Local grammars Compression algorithm Vocalisation Vowelization ","restoring arabic vowels through omission tolerant dictionary lookup","Vowels in Arabic are optional orthographic symbols written as diacritics above or below letters. In Arabic texts, typically more than 97 percent of written words do not explicitly show any of the vowels they contain; that is to say, depending on the author, genre and field, less than 3 percent of words include any explicit vowel. Although numerous studies have been published on the issue of restoring the omitted vowels in speech technologies, little attention has been given to this problem in papers dedicated to written Arabic technologies. In this research, we present Arabic-Unitex, an Arabic Language Resource, with emphasis on vowel representation and encoding. Specifically, we present two dozens of rules formalizing a detailed description of vowel omission in written text. They are typographical rules integrated into large-coverage resources for morphological annotation. For restoring vowels, our resources are capable of identifying words in which the vowels are not shown, as well as words in which the vowels are partially or fully included. By taking into account these rules, our resources are able to compute and restore for each word form a list of compatible fully vowelized candidates through omission-tolerant dictionary lookup. In our previous studies, we have proposed a straightforward encoding of taxonomy for verbs (Neme in Proceedings of the international workshop on lexical resources (WoLeR) at ESSLLI, 2011) and broken plurals (Neme and Laporte in Lang Sci, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.langsci.2013.06.002). While traditional morphology is based on derivational rules, our description is based on inflectional ones. The breakthrough lies in the reversal of the traditional root-and-pattern Semitic model into pattern-and-root, giving precedence to patterns over roots. The lexicon is built and updated manually and contains 76,000 fully vowelized lemmas. It is then inflected by means of finite-state transducers (FSTs), generating 6 million forms. The coverage of these inflected forms is extended by formalized grammars, which accurately describe agglutinations around a core verb, noun, adjective or preposition. A laptop needs one minute to generate the 6 million inflected forms in a 340-MB flat file, which is compressed in 2 min into 11 MB for fast retrieval. Our program performs the analysis of 5000 words/second for running text (20 pages/second). Based on these comprehensive linguistic resources, we created a spell checker that detects any invalid/misplaced vowel in a fully or partially vowelized form. Finally, our resources provide a lexical coverage of more than 99 percent of the words used in popular newspapers, and restore vowels in words (out of context) simply and efficiently.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"Yes"," arabic language arabic language resources arabic nlp semtic morphology root pattern model pattern root model finite state transducers local grammars compression algorithm vocalisation vowelization restoring arabic vowels omission tolerant dictionary lookup vowels arabic optional orthographic symbols written diacritics letters arabic texts typically percent written words explicitly show vowels depending author genre field percent words include explicit vowel numerous studies published issue restoring omitted vowels speech technologies attention problem papers dedicated written arabic technologies research present arabic unitex arabic language resource emphasis vowel representation encoding specifically present dozens rules formalizing detailed description vowel omission written text typographical rules integrated large coverage resources morphological annotation restoring vowels resources capable identifying words vowels shown words vowels partially fully included taking account rules resources compute restore word form list compatible fully vowelized candidates omission tolerant dictionary lookup previous studies proposed straightforward encoding taxonomy verbs neme proceedings international workshop lexical resources woler esslli broken plurals neme laporte lang sci http dx doi org langsci traditional morphology based derivational rules description based inflectional breakthrough lies reversal traditional root pattern semitic model pattern root giving precedence patterns roots lexicon built updated manually fully vowelized lemmas inflected means finite state transducers fsts generating million forms coverage inflected forms extended formalized grammars accurately describe agglutinations core verb noun adjective preposition laptop minute generate million inflected forms mb flat file compressed min mb fast retrieval program performs analysis words running text pages based comprehensive linguistic resources created spell checker detects invalid misplaced vowel fully partially vowelized form finally resources provide lexical coverage percent words popular newspapers restore vowels words context simply efficiently ",1

The various concepts,
 in turn, form networks of mutual links, which makes the structure of the background concepts demanding to model when designing a database structure for this type of dictionary. The Dictionary of medical vocabulary in English, 1375–1550 is a specialized historical dictionary that covers the vast medical lexicon of the centuries examined. It comprises over 12,000 terms, each of them associated with a host of background concepts. Compiling the dictionary took over 15 years. The process started with an analysis of hand-written manuscripts and early printed books from different sources and ended with the electronic dictionary described in the present paper. Over these years, the conceptual structure, database schema, and requirements for essential use cases were iteratively developed. In our paper, we introduce the conceptual structure and database schema modelled for implementing an electronic dictionary that involves different use cases such as term insertion and linking a term to related concepts.

"KeywordsLiterature Literariness Document embeddings Topic models ","vector space explorations of literary language","Literary novels are said to distinguish themselves from other novels through conventions associated with literariness. We investigate the task of predicting the literariness of novels as perceived by readers, based on a large reader survey of contemporary Dutch novels. Previous research showed that ratings of literariness are predictable from texts to a substantial extent using machine learning, suggesting that it may be possible to explain the consensus among readers on which novels are literary as a consensus on the kind of writing style that characterizes literature. Although we have not yet collected human judgments to establish the influence of writing style directly (we use a survey with judgments based on the titles of novels), we can try to analyze the behavior of machine learning models on particular text fragments as a proxy for human judgments. In order to explore aspects of the texts associated with literariness, we divide the texts of the novels in chunks of 2–3 pages and create vector space representations using topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and neural document embeddings (Distributed Bag-of-Words Paragraph Vectors). We analyze the semantic complexity of the novels using distance measures, supporting the notion that literariness can be partly explained as a deviation from the norm. Furthermore, we build predictive models and identify specific keywords and stylistic markers related to literariness. While genre plays a role, we find that the greater part of factors affecting judgments of literariness are explicable in bag-of-words terms,
 even in short text fragments and among novels with higher literary ratings.

The general idea is to learn a model on the (better-resourced) source language, which will then be applied to the (regional) target language. Delexicalization is used to deal with the difference in vocabulary, by creating abstract representations of the data. Transposition consists in modifying the target corpus to be able to use the source models.

However, there are three languages that are mainly spoken in Algeria (Arabic, Tamazight and French) and they can be mixed in the same sentence (code-switching). Moreover, there are several varieties of dialects that differ from one region to another and sometimes within the same region. This paper aims to provide a new multi-purpose parallel corpus (i.e., DZDC12 corpus), which will serve as a testbed for various natural language processing and information retrieval applications. In particular, it can be a useful tool to study Arabic–French code-switching phenomenon, Algerian Romanized Arabic (Arabizi), different Algerian sub-dialects, sentiment analysis, gender writing style, machine translation, abuse detection, etc. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed corpus is the first of its kind, where the texts are written in Latin script and crawled from Facebook. More specifically, this corpus is organised by gender, region and city, and is transliterated into Arabic script and translated into Modern Standard Arabic. In addition, it is annotated for emotion detection and abuse detection, and annotated at the word level.

"KeywordsEmotional speech Italian corpus Elicitation Prototype Mood induction procedures Machine learning ","demos an italian emotional speech corpus","We present DEMoS (Database of Elicited Mood in Speech), a new, large database with Italian emotional speech: 68 speakers, some 9 k speech samples.
 As Italian is under-represented in speech emotion research, for a comparison with the state-of-the-art, we model the ‘big 6 emotions’ and guilt. Besides making available this database for research, our contribution is three-fold: First, we employ a variety of mood induction procedures, whose combinations are especially tailored for specific emotions.
 Second, we use combinations of selection procedures such as an alexithymia test and self- and external assessment, obtaining 1,5 k (proto-) typical samples; these were used in a perception test (86 native Italian subjects, categorical identification and dimensional rating). Third, machine learning techniques—based on standardised brute-forced openSMILE ComParE features and support vector machine classifiers—were applied to assess how emotional typicality and sample size might impact machine learning efficiency.
 Our results are three-fold as well: First, we show that appropriate induction techniques ensure the collection of valid samples, whereas the type of self-assessment employed turned out not to be a meaningful measurement. Second, emotional typicality—which shows up in an acoustic analysis of prosodic main features—in contrast to sample size is not an essential feature for successfully training machine learning models. Third, the perceptual findings demonstrate that the confusion patterns mostly relate to cultural rules and to ambiguous emotions.

"KeywordsTextual definitions Glosses Word Sense Disambiguation Entity linking Multilinguality Lexical resources ","sensedefs a multilingual corpus of semantically annotated textual definitions","Definitional knowledge has proved to be essential in various Natural Language Processing tasks and applications, especially when information at the level of word senses is exploited. However, the few sense-annotated corpora of textual definitions available to date are of limited size: this is mainly due to the expensive and time-consuming process of annotating a wide variety of word senses and entity mentions at a reasonably high scale. In this paper we present SenseDefs, a large-scale high-quality corpus of disambiguated definitions (or glosses) in multiple languages, comprising sense annotations of both concepts and named entities from a wide-coverage unified sense inventory. Our approach for the construction and disambiguation of this corpus builds upon the structure of a large multilingual semantic network and a state-of-the-art disambiguation system: first, we gather complementary information of equivalent definitions across different languages to provide context for disambiguation; then we refine the disambiguation output with a distributional approach based on semantic similarity. As a result, we obtain a multilingual corpus of textual definitions featuring over 38 million definitions in 263 languages, and we publicly release it to the research community. We assess the quality of SenseDefs’s sense annotations both intrinsically and extrinsically on Open Information Extraction and Sense Clustering tasks.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"Yes"," textual definitions glosses word sense disambiguation entity linking multilinguality lexical resources sensedefs multilingual corpus semantically annotated textual definitions definitional knowledge proved essential natural language processing tasks applications information level word senses exploited sense annotated corpora textual definitions date limited size due expensive time consuming process annotating wide variety word senses entity mentions high scale paper present sensedefs large scale high quality corpus disambiguated definitions glosses multiple languages comprising sense annotations concepts named entities wide coverage unified sense inventory approach construction disambiguation corpus builds structure large multilingual semantic network state art disambiguation system gather complementary information equivalent definitions languages provide context disambiguation refine disambiguation output distributional approach based semantic similarity result obtain multilingual corpus textual definitions featuring million definitions languages publicly release research community assess quality sensedefs sense annotations intrinsically extrinsically open information extraction sense clustering tasks ",1

The resulting datasets are not just suited for evaluation purposes but can also serve as a general source of information about terms and even as training data for supervised methods.

"KeywordsDiscourse markers Detection/correction of errors Writing support tool Academic writing Native language interference ","automatic detection and correction of discourse marker errors made by spanish native speakers in portuguese academic writing","Discourse markers are words and expressions (such as: firstly, then, for example, because, as a result, likewise, in comparison, in contrast) that explicitly state the relational structure of the information in the text, i.e. signalling a sequential relationship between the current message and the previous discourse. Using these markers improves the cohesion and coherence of texts, facilitating reading comprehension. Although often included in tools that support the rhetoric structuring of texts, discourse markers have hardly been explored in writing support tools for learners of a second language. However, learners of a second language, including those at advanced levels, have trouble producing these lexical items, frequently replacing them with items from their native language or with literal translations of items in their own language, which often do not result in proper lexical items in the second language. In addition, students learn a single marker per function and use it repeatedly, producing monotonous texts. With the aim of contributing to reducing these difficulties, this paper presents a lexicon that will be used to support the task of automatically detecting and correcting discourse marker errors. Several heuristics have been evaluated to generate different types of errors. Automatic translation methods were used to semi-automatically compile the lexicon used in these heuristics. Similarity measures were also combined with these heuristics to correct discourse marker errors. The evaluated methods proved to be suitable for the task of identifying some types of discourse marker errors and can potentially identify many others, as long as new lexical inputs are incorporated into them.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"No"," discourse markers detection correction errors writing support tool academic writing native language interference automatic detection correction discourse marker errors made spanish native speakers portuguese academic writing discourse markers words expressions firstly result likewise comparison contrast explicitly state relational structure information text signalling sequential relationship current message previous discourse markers improves cohesion coherence texts facilitating reading comprehension included tools support rhetoric structuring texts discourse markers explored writing support tools learners language learners language including advanced levels trouble producing lexical items frequently replacing items native language literal translations items language result proper lexical items language addition students learn single marker function repeatedly producing monotonous texts aim contributing reducing difficulties paper presents lexicon support task automatically detecting correcting discourse marker errors heuristics evaluated generate types errors automatic translation methods semi automatically compile lexicon heuristics similarity measures combined heuristics correct discourse marker errors evaluated methods proved suitable task identifying types discourse marker errors potentially identify long lexical inputs incorporated ",0

It departs from observations about working practices in Humanities disciplines following a hermeneutic tradition of text interpretation versus the method-oriented research strategies in Computational Linguistics (CL). The respective praxeological traditions are quite different. Yet more and more researchers are willing to open up towards truly transdisciplinary collaborations, trying to exploit advanced methods from CL within research that ultimately addresses questions from the traditional Humanities disciplines and the Social Sciences. The article identifies two central workflow-related issues for this type of collaborative project in the Digital Humanities (DH) and Computational Social Science: (1) a scheduling dilemma, which affects the point in the course of the project when specifications of the core analysis task are fixed (as early as possible from the computational perspective, but as late as possible from the Humanities perspective) and (2) the subjectivity problem, which concerns the degree of intersubjective stability of the target categories of analysis. CL methodology demands high inter-annotator agreement and theory-independent categories, while the categories in hermeneutic reasoning are often tied to a particular interpretive approach (viz. a theory of literary interpretation) and may bear a non-trivial relation to a reader’s pre-understanding. Building a comprehensive methodological framework that helps overcome these issues requires considerable time and patience. The established computational methodology has to be gradually opened up to more hermeneutically oriented research questions; resources and tools for the relevant categories of analysis have to be constructed. This article does not call into question that well-targeted efforts along this path are worthwhile. Yet, it makes the following additional programmatic point regarding directions for future research: It might be fruitful to explore—in parallel—the potential lying in DH-specific variants of the concept of rapid prototyping from Software Engineering. To get an idea of how computational analysis of some aspect of text might contribute to a hermeneutic research question, a prototypical analysis model is constructed, e.g., from related data collections and analysis categories, using transfer techniques. While the initial quality of analysis may be limited, the idea of rapid probing allows scholars to explore how the analysis fits in an actual workflow on the target text data and it can thus provide early feedback for the process of refining the modeling. If the rapid probing method can indeed be incorporated in a hermeneutic framework to the satisfaction of well-disposed Humanities scholars, a swifter exploration of alternative paths of analysis would become possible. This may generate considerable additional momentum for transdisciplinary integration. It is as yet too early to point to truly Humanities-oriented examples of the proposed rapid probing technique. To nevertheless make the programmatic idea more concrete, the article uses two experimental scenarios to argue how rapid probing might help addressing the scheduling dilemma and the subjectivity problem respectively. The first scenario illustrates the transfer of complex analysis pipelines across corpora; the second one addresses rapid annotation experiments targeting character mentions in literary text.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"No"," digital humanities adaptation nlp tool chains interdisciplinary working practice computational text analysis humanities combine working practices contributing fields position paper based keynote presentation coling workshop language technology digital humanities osaka japan departs observations working practices humanities disciplines hermeneutic tradition text interpretation versus method oriented research strategies computational linguistics cl respective praxeological traditions researchers open transdisciplinary collaborations exploit advanced methods cl research ultimately addresses questions traditional humanities disciplines social sciences article identifies central workflow related issues type collaborative project digital humanities dh computational social science scheduling dilemma affects point project specifications core analysis task fixed early computational perspective late humanities perspective subjectivity problem concerns degree intersubjective stability target categories analysis cl methodology demands high inter annotator agreement theory independent categories categories hermeneutic reasoning tied interpretive approach theory literary interpretation bear trivial relation reader pre understanding building comprehensive methodological framework helps overcome issues requires considerable time patience established computational methodology gradually opened hermeneutically oriented research questions resources tools relevant categories analysis constructed article call question targeted efforts path worthwhile makes additional programmatic point directions future research fruitful explore parallel potential lying dh specific variants concept rapid prototyping software engineering idea computational analysis aspect text contribute hermeneutic research question prototypical analysis model constructed related data collections analysis categories transfer techniques initial quality analysis limited idea rapid probing scholars explore analysis fits actual workflow target text data provide early feedback process refining modeling rapid probing method incorporated hermeneutic framework satisfaction disposed humanities scholars swifter exploration alternative paths analysis generate considerable additional momentum transdisciplinary integration early point humanities oriented examples proposed rapid probing technique make programmatic idea concrete article experimental scenarios argue rapid probing addressing scheduling dilemma subjectivity problem scenario illustrates transfer complex analysis pipelines corpora addresses rapid annotation experiments targeting character mentions literary text ",0
"KeywordsCross-disciplinary communication Disambiguation Word sense induction SenseClusters Terminological ambiguity ","approaching terminological ambiguity in cross disciplinary communication as a word sense induction task a pilot study","Cross-disciplinary communication is often impeded by terminological ambiguity. Hence, cross-disciplinary teams would greatly benefit from using a language technology-based tool that allows for the (at least semi-) automated resolution of ambiguous terms. Although no such tool is readily available, an interesting theoretical outline of one does exist. The main obstacle for the concrete realization of this tool is the current lack of an effective method for the automatic detection of the different meanings of ambiguous terms across different disciplinary jargons. In this paper, we set up a pilot study to experimentally assess whether the word sense induction technique of ‘context clustering’, as implemented in the software package ‘SenseClusters’, might be a solution. More specifically, given several sets of sentences coming from a cross-disciplinary corpus containing a specific ambiguous term, we verify whether this technique can classify each sentence in accordance to the meaning of the ambiguous term in that sentence. For the experiments, we first compile a corpus that represents the disciplinary jargons involved in a project on Bone Tissue Engineering. Next, we conduct two series of experiments. The first series focuses on determining appropriate SenseClusters parameter settings using manually selected test data for the ambiguous target terms ‘matrix’ and ‘model’. The second series evaluates the actual performance of SenseClusters using randomly selected test data for an extended set of target terms. We observe that SenseClusters can successfully classify sentences from a cross-disciplinary corpus according to the meaning of the ambiguous term they contain. Hence, we argue that this implementation of context clustering shows potential as a method for the automatic detection of the meanings of ambiguous terms in cross-disciplinary communication.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"No"," cross disciplinary communication disambiguation word sense induction senseclusters terminological ambiguity approaching terminological ambiguity cross disciplinary communication word sense induction task pilot study cross disciplinary communication impeded terminological ambiguity cross disciplinary teams greatly benefit language technology based tool semi automated resolution ambiguous terms tool readily interesting theoretical outline exist main obstacle concrete realization tool current lack effective method automatic detection meanings ambiguous terms disciplinary jargons paper set pilot study experimentally assess word sense induction technique context clustering implemented software package senseclusters solution specifically sets sentences coming cross disciplinary corpus specific ambiguous term verify technique classify sentence accordance meaning ambiguous term sentence experiments compile corpus represents disciplinary jargons involved project bone tissue engineering conduct series experiments series focuses determining senseclusters parameter settings manually selected test data ambiguous target terms matrix model series evaluates actual performance senseclusters randomly selected test data extended set target terms observe senseclusters successfully classify sentences cross disciplinary corpus meaning ambiguous term argue implementation context clustering shows potential method automatic detection meanings ambiguous terms cross disciplinary communication ",0
"KeywordsIntrinsic plagiarism detection Character n-grams Stylistic features Writing style analysis ","on the use of character n grams as the only intrinsic evidence of plagiarism","When a shift in writing style is noticed in a document, doubts arise about its originality. Based on this clue to plagiarism, the intrinsic approach to plagiarism detection identifies the stolen passages by analysing the writing style of the suspicious document without comparing it to textual resources that may serve as sources for the plagiarist. Character n-grams are recognised as a successful approach to modelling text for writing style analysis. Although prior studies have investigated the best practice of using character n-grams in authorship attribution and other problems, there is still a need for such investigations in the context of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Moreover, it has been assumed in previous works that the ways of using character n-grams in authorship attribution remain the same for intrinsic plagiarism detection. In this paper, we study the effect of character n-grams frequency and length on the performance of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Our experiments utilise two state-of-the-art methods and five large document collections of PAN labs written in English and Arabic. We demonstrate empirically that the low- and the high-frequency n-grams are not equally relevant for intrinsic plagiarism detection, but their performance depends on the way they are exploited.

"KeywordsSentiment analysis Opinion mining Sentiment shifters Shifter identification Association rule mining WARM Machine learning ","applying data mining and machine learning techniques for sentiment shifter identification","Sentiment shifters, as a set of words and expressions that can affect text polarity, play a fundamental role in opinion mining. However, the limited ability of current automated opinion mining systems in handling shifters is a major challenge. This paper presents three novel and efficient methods for identifying sentiment shifters in reviews in order to improve the overall accuracy of opinion mining systems: two data mining based algorithms and a machine learning based algorithm. The data mining algorithms do not need shifter tagged datasets. They use weighted association rule mining (WARM) for finding frequent patterns representing sentiment shifters from a domain-specific and a general corpus. These patterns include different kinds of shifter words such as shifter verbs and quantifiers and are able to handle both local and long-distance shifters. The items in WARM for the two designed methods are in the form of dependency relations and SRL arguments of sentences, respectively. Secondly, we implemented a supervised machine learning system based on semantic features of sentences for shifter identification and polarity classification. This method obviously needs shifter tagged dataset for shifter identification. We tested our proposed algorithms on polarity classification task for 2 domains: a specific domain (drug reviews) and a general domain.

While the research literature abounds with qualitative analyses on these dialogues, they are rarely corroborated on statistics from the entire text. In this article, we leverage a corpus of annotated direct speech in the New Testament, as well as recent advances in automatic speaker and listener identification, to present a quantitative study on dialogue structure in the Gospels. The contributions of this article are three-fold. First, we quantify a variety of features that are widely used in characterizing dialogue structure—including dialogue length, turn length, and the initiation and conclusion of a dialogue—and show how they distinguish between different Gospels. Second, we compare our statistics with qualitative comments in the New Testament research literature, and extend them to cover the entirety of the Gospels. Most significantly, we gauge the feasibility of applying our approach to other literary works, by measuring the amount of errors that would be introduced by automatically identified dialogues, speakers and listeners.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"No"," dialogue automatic speaker attribution gospels testament dialogue analysis case study testament research nature dialogues bible research literature abounds qualitative analyses dialogues rarely corroborated statistics entire text article leverage corpus annotated direct speech testament recent advances automatic speaker listener identification present quantitative study dialogue structure gospels contributions article fold quantify variety features widely characterizing dialogue structure including dialogue length turn length initiation conclusion dialogue show distinguish gospels compare statistics qualitative comments testament research literature extend cover entirety gospels significantly gauge feasibility applying approach literary works measuring amount errors introduced automatically identified dialogues speakers listeners ",0

Evaluation is further made inconsistent, even unrepresentative of real world usage by the lack of distinction between the different types of toponyms, which necessitates new guidelines, a consolidation of metrics and a detailed toponym taxonomy with implications for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and beyond. To address these deficiencies, our manuscript introduces a new framework in three parts.

"KeywordsSpelling variation Non-standard language Historical texts Information retrieval ","token based spelling variant detection in middle low german texts","In this paper we present a pipeline for the detection of spelling variants, i.e., different spellings that represent the same word, in non-standard texts. For example, in Middle Low German texts in and ihn (among others) are potential spellings of a single word, the personal pronoun ‘him’. Spelling variation is usually addressed by normalization, in which non-standard variants are mapped to a corresponding standard variant, e.g. the Modern German word ihn in the case of in. However, the approach to spelling variant detection presented here does not need such a reference to a standard variant and can therefore be applied to data for which a standard variant is missing.
 The pipeline we present first generates spelling variants for a given word using rewrite rules and surface similarity. Afterwards, the generated types are filtered. We present a new filter that works on the token level, i.e., taking the context of a word into account. Through this mechanism ambiguities on the type level can be resolved. For instance, the Middle Low German word in can not only be the personal pronoun ‘him’, but also the preposition ‘in’, and each of these has different variants. The detected spelling variants can be used in two settings for Digital Humanities research: On the one hand, they can be used to facilitate searching in non-standard texts. On the other hand, they can be used to improve the performance of natural language processing tools on the data by reducing the number of unknown words.
 To evaluate the utility of the pipeline in both applications, we present two evaluation settings and evaluate the pipeline on Middle Low German texts. We were able to improve the F1 score compared with previous work from \(0.39\) to \(0.52\) for the search setting and from \(0.23\) to \(0.30\) when detecting spelling variants of unknown words.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"No"," spelling variation standard language historical texts information retrieval token based spelling variant detection middle low german texts paper present pipeline detection spelling variants spellings represent word standard texts middle low german texts ihn potential spellings single word personal pronoun spelling variation addressed normalization standard variants mapped standard variant modern german word ihn case approach spelling variant detection presented reference standard variant applied data standard variant missing pipeline present generates spelling variants word rewrite rules surface similarity generated types filtered present filter works token level taking context word account mechanism ambiguities type level resolved instance middle low german word personal pronoun preposition variants detected spelling variants settings digital humanities research hand facilitate searching standard texts hand improve performance natural language processing tools data reducing number unknown words evaluate utility pipeline applications present evaluation settings evaluate pipeline middle low german texts improve f score compared previous work search setting detecting spelling variants unknown words ",0

Urdu language processing presents a challenge due to the dual behaviour of various Urdu POS tags in differing situations (morphosyntactic ambiguity). This paper addresses this challenge by developing a novel tagging approach using linear-chain conditional random fields (CRF). Our work is the first instance of a CRF approach for Urdu POS tagging. The proposed model employs a strong, stable and balanced language-independent as well as language dependent feature set. The language-dependent feature considered includes part-of-speech tag of the previous word and suffix of the current word while the language-independent features includes the ‘context words window’. Our approach was evaluated against support vector machine techniques for Urdu POS—considered as state of the art—on two benchmark datasets.

"KeywordsMachine translation Machine translation evaluation MT metric Linguistic features Qualitative approach ","verta a linguistic approach to automatic machine translation evaluation","Machine translation (MT) is directly linked to its evaluation in order to both compare different MT system outputs and analyse system errors so that they can be addressed and corrected. As a consequence, MT evaluation has become increasingly important and popular in the last decade, leading to the development of MT evaluation metrics aiming at automatically assessing MT output. Most of these metrics use reference translations in order to compare system output, and the most well-known and widely spread work at lexical level. In this study we describe and present a linguistically-motivated metric, VERTa, which aims at using and combining a wide variety of linguistic features at lexical, morphological, syntactic and semantic level. Before designing and developing VERTa a qualitative linguistic analysis of data was performed so as to identify the linguistic phenomena that an MT metric must consider (Comelles et al. 2017). In the present study we introduce VERTa’s design and architecture and we report the experiments performed in order to develop the metric and to check the suitability and interaction of the linguistic information used. The experiments carried out go beyond traditional correlation scores and step towards a more qualitative approach based on linguistic analysis. Finally, in order to check the validity of the metric, an evaluation has been conducted comparing the metric’s performance to that of other well-known state-of-the-art MT metrics.","Language Resources and Evaluation",2019,"No"," machine translation machine translation evaluation mt metric linguistic features qualitative approach verta linguistic approach automatic machine translation evaluation machine translation mt directly linked evaluation order compare mt system outputs analyse system errors addressed corrected consequence mt evaluation increasingly important popular decade leading development mt evaluation metrics aiming automatically assessing mt output metrics reference translations order compare system output widely spread work lexical level study describe present linguistically motivated metric verta aims combining wide variety linguistic features lexical morphological syntactic semantic level designing developing verta qualitative linguistic analysis data performed identify linguistic phenomena mt metric comelles al present study introduce verta design architecture report experiments performed order develop metric check suitability interaction linguistic information experiments carried traditional correlation scores step qualitative approach based linguistic analysis finally order check validity metric evaluation conducted comparing metric performance state art mt metrics ",0

As first steps, the workflow usually involves batch scanning and optical character recognition (OCR) of documents. In the case of multi-page documents, the preservation of document contexts is a major requirement. To facilitate workflows involving very large amounts of paper scans, page stream segmentation (PSS) is the task to automatically separate a stream of scanned images into coherent multi-page documents. In a digitization project together with a German federal archive, we developed a novel approach for PSS based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). As a first project, we combine visual information from scanned images with semantic information from OCR-ed texts for this task. The multi-modal combination of features in a single classification architecture allows for major improvements towards optimal document separation. Further to multimodality, our PSS approach profits from transfer-learning and sequential page modeling.

The NDRA differs from existing models of response times in the reading aloud task in two ways. First, a single lexical architecture is responsible for both word and non-word naming. As such, the model differs from dual-route models, which consist of both a lexical route and a sub-lexical route that directly maps orthographic units onto phonological units. Second, the linguistic core of the NDRA exclusively operates on the basis of the equilibrium equations for the well-established general human learning algorithm provided by the Rescorla-Wagner model. The model therefore does not posit language-specific processing mechanisms and avoids the problems of psychological and neurobiological implausibility associated with alternative computational implementations.

Neolithic spreads due to dispersal of populations are called demic, and those due to the incorporation of hunter-gatherers are called cultural.

It has been proposed that this spread took place alongside with that of Bantu languages. In eastern and southeastern Africa, it is also linked to the Early Iron Age. From the beginning of the last millennium BC, cereal agriculture spread rapidly from the Great Lakes area eastwards to the East African coast, and southwards to northeastern South Africa. Here we show that the southwards spread took place substantially more rapidly (1.50–2.27 km/y) than the eastwards spread (0.59–1.27 km/y).

NA,"introduction to special issue beyond the lab using big data to discover principles of cognition","Like many other scientific disciplines, psychological science has felt the impact of the big-data revolution. This impact arises from the meeting of three forces: data availability, data heterogeneity, and data analyzability. In terms of data availability, consider that for decades, researchers relied on the Brown Corpus of about one million words (Kučera & Francis, 1969). Modern resources, in contrast, are larger by six orders of magnitude (e.g., Google’s 1T corpus) and are available in a growing number of languages. About 240 billion photos have been uploaded to Facebook,1 and Instagram receives over 100 million new photos each day.2 The large-scale digitization of these data has made it possible in principle to analyze and aggregate these resources on a previously unimagined scale. Heterogeneity refers to the availability of different types of data. For example, recent progress in automatic image recognition is owed not just to improvements in algorithms and hardware, but arguably more to the ability to merge large collections of images with linguistic labels (produced by crowdsourced human taggers) that serve as training data to the algorithms. Making use of heterogeneous data sources often depends on their standardization. For example, the ability to combine demographic and grammatical data about thousands of languages led to the finding that languages spoken by more people have simpler morphologies (Lupyan & Dale, 2010). The ability to combine these data types would have been substantially more difficult without the existence of standardized language and country codes that could be used to merge the different data sources. Finally, analyzability must be ensured, for without appropriate tools to process and analyze different types of data, the “data” are merely bytes.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," introduction special issue lab big data discover principles cognition scientific disciplines psychological science felt impact big data revolution impact arises meeting forces data availability data heterogeneity data analyzability terms data availability decades researchers relied brown corpus million words ku era francis modern resources contrast larger orders magnitude google t corpus growing number languages billion photos uploaded facebook instagram receives million photos day large scale digitization data made principle analyze aggregate resources previously unimagined scale heterogeneity refers availability types data recent progress automatic image recognition owed improvements algorithms hardware arguably ability merge large collections images linguistic labels produced crowdsourced human taggers serve training data algorithms making heterogeneous data sources depends standardization ability combine demographic grammatical data thousands languages led finding languages spoken people simpler morphologies lupyan dale ability combine data types substantially difficult existence standardized language country codes merge data sources finally analyzability ensured tools process analyze types data data bytes ",0

The Glasgow Norms are unique in several respects. First, the corpus itself is relatively large, while simultaneously providing norms across a substantial number of lexical dimensions. Second, for any given subset of words, the same participants provided ratings across all nine dimensions (33 participants/word, on average). Third, two novel dimensions—semantic size and gender association—are included. Finally, the corpus contains a set of 379 ambiguous words that are presented either alone (e.g., toast) or with information that selects an alternative sense (e.g., toast (bread), toast (speech)). The relationships between the dimensions of the Glasgow Norms were initially investigated by assessing their correlations. In addition, a principal component analysis revealed four main factors, accounting for 82% of the variance (Visualization, Emotion, Salience, and Exposure). The validity of the Glasgow Norms was established via comparisons of our ratings to 18 different sets of current psycholinguistic norms. The dimension of size was tested with megastudy data, confirming findings from past studies that have explicitly examined this variable. Alternative senses of ambiguous words (i.e., disambiguated forms), when discordant on a given dimension, seemingly led to appropriately distinct ratings. Informal comparisons between the ratings of ambiguous words and of their alternative senses showed different patterns that likely depended on several factors (the number of senses, their relative strengths, and the rating scales themselves). Overall, the Glasgow Norms provide a valuable resource—in particular, for researchers investigating the role of word recognition in language comprehension.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes"," psycholinguistic norms arousal valence dominance concreteness imageability familiarity age acquisition semantic size gender association glasgow norms ratings words scales glasgow norms set normative ratings english words psycholinguistic dimensions arousal valence dominance concreteness imageability familiarity age acquisition semantic size gender association glasgow norms unique respects corpus large simultaneously providing norms substantial number lexical dimensions subset words participants provided ratings dimensions participants word average dimensions semantic size gender association included finally corpus set ambiguous words presented toast information selects alternative sense toast bread toast speech relationships dimensions glasgow norms initially investigated assessing correlations addition principal component analysis revealed main factors accounting variance visualization emotion salience exposure validity glasgow norms established comparisons ratings sets current psycholinguistic norms dimension size tested megastudy data confirming findings past studies explicitly examined variable alternative senses ambiguous words disambiguated forms discordant dimension seemingly led appropriately distinct ratings informal comparisons ratings ambiguous words alternative senses showed patterns depended factors number senses relative strengths rating scales glasgow norms provide valuable resource researchers investigating role word recognition language comprehension ",1
"KeywordsPerceptual strength Norms Regression Psycholinguistic variables ","visual and auditory perceptual strength norms for 3596 french nouns and their relationship with other psycholinguistic variables","Perceptual experience plays a critical role in the conceptual representation of words. Higher levels of semantic variables such as imageability, concreteness, and sensory experience are generally associated with faster and more accurate word processing. Nevertheless, these variables tend to be assessed mostly on the basis of visual experience. This underestimates the potential contributions of other perceptual modalities. Accordingly, recent evidence has stressed the importance of providing modality-specific perceptual strength norms. In the present study, we developed French Canadian norms of visual and auditory perceptual strength (i.e., the modalities that have major impact on word processing) for 3,596 nouns. We then explored the relationship between these newly developed variables and other lexical, orthographic, and semantic variables. Finally, we demonstrated the contributions of visual and auditory perceptual strength ratings to visual word processing beyond those of other semantic variables related to perceptual experience (e.g., concreteness, imageability, and sensory experience ratings). The ratings developed in this study are a meaningful contribution toward the implementation of new studies that will shed further light on the interaction between linguistic, semantic, and perceptual systems.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes"," perceptual strength norms regression psycholinguistic variables visual auditory perceptual strength norms french nouns relationship psycholinguistic variables perceptual experience plays critical role conceptual representation words higher levels semantic variables imageability concreteness sensory experience generally faster accurate word processing variables tend assessed basis visual experience underestimates potential contributions perceptual modalities recent evidence stressed importance providing modality specific perceptual strength norms present study developed french canadian norms visual auditory perceptual strength modalities major impact word processing nouns explored relationship newly developed variables lexical orthographic semantic variables finally demonstrated contributions visual auditory perceptual strength ratings visual word processing semantic variables related perceptual experience concreteness imageability sensory experience ratings ratings developed study meaningful contribution implementation studies shed light interaction linguistic semantic perceptual systems ",1

Our procedure allowed subjects to provide multiple responses for each cue, which permits us to measure weak associations.

However, norms for a crucial semantic variable—that is, conceptual familiarity—have not been available for a sizeable French database. We thus developed French Canadian conceptual familiarity norms for 3,596 nouns. This enriches Desrochers and Thompson’s (2009) database, in which subjective frequency and imageability values are already available for the same words. We collected online data from 313 Canadian French speakers. The full database of conceptual familiarity ratings is freely available at http://lingualab.ca/fr/projets/normes-de-familiarite-conceptuelle. We then demonstrated the utility of these new conceptual familiarity norms by assessing their contribution to lexical decision times. We conducted a stepwise regression model with conceptual familiarity in the last step. This allowed us to assess the independent contribution of conceptual familiarity beyond the contributions of other well-known psycholinguistic variables, such as frequency, imageability, and age of acquisition. The results showed that conceptual familiarity facilitated lexical decision latencies.

These feature lists for each concept were then coded into their root word form and affixes (i.e., cat and s for cats) to explore the impact of word form on semantic similarity measures, which are often calculated by comparing concept feature lists (feature overlap). All concept features, coding, and calculated similarity information is provided in a searchable database for easy access and utilization for future researchers when designing experiments that use word stimuli.

"KeywordsMotor content Verbs Database Norms ","motor content norms for 4565 verbs in spanish","Embodiment theory suggests that, during the processing of words related to movement, as in the case of action verbs, somatotopic activation is produced in the motor and premotor cortices. In the same way, some studies have demonstrated that patients with frontal-lobe damage, such as Parkinson’s patients, have difficulties processing that kind of stimulus. At the moment, no standardized data exist concerning the motor content of Spanish verbs. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to develop a database of 4,565 verbs in Spanish through a survey filled out by 152 university students.

"KeywordsSemantic ambiguity Homonyms Meaning frequency Homonym norming methods and data Movie subtitles Free association Homonym meaning annotations ","a comparison of homonym meaning frequency estimates derived from movie and television subtitles free association and explicit ratings","Most words are ambiguous, with interpretation dependent on context. Advancing theories of ambiguity resolution is important for any general theory of language processing, and for resolving inconsistencies in observed ambiguity effects across experimental tasks. Focusing on homonyms (words such as bank with unrelated meanings EDGE OF A RIVER vs. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION), the present work advances theories and methods for estimating the relative frequency of their meanings, a factor that shapes observed ambiguity effects. We develop a new method for estimating meaning frequency based on the meaning of a homonym evoked in lines of movie and television subtitles according to human raters. We also replicate and extend a measure of meaning frequency derived from the classification of free associates. We evaluate the internal consistency of these measures, compare them to published estimates based on explicit ratings of each meaning’s frequency, and compare each set of norms in predicting performance in lexical and semantic decision mega-studies. All measures have high internal consistency and show agreement, but each is also associated with unique variance, which may be explained by integrating cognitive theories of memory with the demands of different experimental methodologies. To derive frequency estimates, we collected manual classifications of 533 homonyms over 50,000 lines of subtitles, and of 357 homonyms across over 5000 homonym–associate pairs. This database—publicly available at: www.blairarmstrong.net/homonymnorms/—constitutes a novel resource for computational cognitive modeling and computational linguistics, and we offer suggestions around good practices for its use in training and testing models on labeled data.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes"," semantic ambiguity homonyms meaning frequency homonym norming methods data movie subtitles free association homonym meaning annotations comparison homonym meaning frequency estimates derived movie television subtitles free association explicit ratings words ambiguous interpretation dependent context advancing theories ambiguity resolution important general theory language processing resolving inconsistencies observed ambiguity effects experimental tasks focusing homonyms words bank unrelated meanings edge river financial institution present work advances theories methods estimating relative frequency meanings factor shapes observed ambiguity effects develop method estimating meaning frequency based meaning homonym evoked lines movie television subtitles human raters replicate extend measure meaning frequency derived classification free associates evaluate internal consistency measures compare published estimates based explicit ratings meaning frequency compare set norms predicting performance lexical semantic decision mega studies measures high internal consistency show agreement unique variance explained integrating cognitive theories memory demands experimental methodologies derive frequency estimates collected manual classifications homonyms lines subtitles homonyms homonym associate pairs database publicly www blairarmstrong net homonymnorms constitutes resource computational cognitive modeling computational linguistics offer suggestions good practices training testing models labeled data ",1

We also report several tests of reliability and validity, demonstrating that our historical concreteness scores have high levels of both. Study 2 uses concreteness scores to revisit findings of studies that use a static set of contemporary human concreteness norms to examine historical trends of semantic change.

The uncertainty due to sampling variability in the norming phase is ignored. To express uncertainty due to norming, we propose a flexible method that is applicable in continuous norming and allows for a variety of score distributions, using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS; Rigby & Stasinopoulos, 2005). We assessed the performance of this method in a simulation study, by examining the quality of the resulting CIs. We varied the population model, procedure of estimating the CI, confidence level, sample size, value of the predictor, extremity of the test score, and type of variance-covariance matrix. The results showed that good quality of the CIs could be achieved in most conditions. The method is illustrated using normative data of the SON-R 6-40 test. We recommend test developers to use this approach to arrive at CIs, and thus properly express the uncertainty due to norm sampling fluctuations, in the context of continuous norming.

Researchers have studied the effects of BOI in order to investigate the relationships between sensorimotor and cognitive processes. Such efforts could be improved, however, by the availability of more extensive BOI norms. In the present work, we collected BOI ratings for over 9,000 words. These new norms show good reliability and validity and have extensive overlap with the words used both in other lexical and semantic norms and in the available behavioral megastudies (e.g., the English Lexicon Project, Balota, Yap, Cortese, Hutchison, Kessler, & Loftis in Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007; and the Calgary Semantic Decision Project, Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017). In analyses using the new BOI norms, we found that high-BOI words tended to be more concrete, more graspable, and more strongly associated with sensory, haptic, and visual experience than are low-BOI words. When we used the new norms to predict response latencies and accuracy data from the behavioral megastudies, we found that BOI was a stronger predictor of responses in the semantic decision task than in the lexical decision task. These findings are consistent with a dynamic, multidimensional account of lexical semantics.

In many of these studies, participants are typically told to learn foreign language–English translations, such as Swahili–English or Lithuanian–English pairs. One limitation of these currently available foreign language–English translation norms is that their foreign languages are based on the alphabetic writing system, thereby preventing researchers from generalizing their findings to languages based on logographic writing systems. In the present study we collected normative data for 160 Chinese–English word pairs. Participants completed three study–test cycles, followed by metacognitive judgments on their learning experience. For each pair, we report recall performance, recall latency, ease of learning, and judgments of learning. A simultaneous multiple regression analysis with frequency (of both the English word and the Chinese character), word length (English), and number of strokes (Chinese) as predictors revealed that a greater number of strokes (or higher visual complexity) for the Chinese characters predicted lower target recall.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes"," paired associates chinese english translations cued recall episodic memory normative data chinese english paired associates paired associate learning commonly paradigms study human memory studies participants typically told learn foreign language english translations swahili english lithuanian english pairs limitation foreign language english translation norms foreign languages based alphabetic writing system preventing researchers generalizing findings languages based logographic writing systems present study collected normative data chinese english word pairs participants completed study test cycles metacognitive judgments learning experience pair report recall performance recall latency ease learning judgments learning simultaneous multiple regression analysis frequency english word chinese character word length english number strokes chinese predictors revealed greater number strokes higher visual complexity chinese characters predicted lower target recall ",1

This article introduces the spreadr R package, which can implement spreading activation within a specified network structure. The algorithmic method implemented in the spreadr subroutines follows the approach described in Vitevitch, Ercal, and Adagarla (Frontiers in Psychology, 2, 369, 2011), who viewed activation as a fixed cognitive resource that could “spread” among connected nodes in a network. Three sets of simulations were conducted using the package. The first set of simulations successfully reproduced the results reported in Vitevitch et al. (Frontiers in Psychology, 2, 369, 2011), who showed that a simple mechanism of spreading activation could account for the clustering coefficient effect in spoken word recognition. The second set of simulations showed that the same mechanism could be extended to account for higher false alarm rates for low clustering coefficient words in a false memory task. The final set of simulations demonstrated how spreading activation could be applied to a semantic network to account for semantic priming effects. It is hoped that this package will encourage cognitive and language scientists to explicitly consider how the structures of cognitive systems such as the mental lexicon and semantic memory interact with the process of spreading activation.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," spreading activation network science computer simulation lexical retrieval false memory clustering coefficient semantic priming semantic network spreadr package simulate spreading activation network notion spreading activation central theme cognitive sciences tools implementing spreading activation computationally readily article introduces spreadr package implement spreading activation network structure algorithmic method implemented spreadr subroutines approach vitevitch ercal adagarla frontiers psychology viewed activation fixed cognitive resource spread connected nodes network sets simulations conducted package set simulations successfully reproduced results reported vitevitch al frontiers psychology showed simple mechanism spreading activation account clustering coefficient effect spoken word recognition set simulations showed mechanism extended account higher false alarm rates low clustering coefficient words false memory task final set simulations demonstrated spreading activation applied semantic network account semantic priming effects hoped package encourage cognitive language scientists explicitly structures cognitive systems mental lexicon semantic memory interact process spreading activation ",0
"KeywordsPitch perception Musical abilities Pitch accuracy Gold-MSI ","the mistuning perception test a new measurement instrument","An important aspect of the perceived quality of vocal music is the degree to which the vocalist sings in tune. Although most listeners seem sensitive to vocal mistuning, little is known about the development of this perceptual ability or how it differs between listeners. Motivated by a lack of suitable preexisting measures, we introduce in this article an adaptive and ecologically valid test of mistuning perception ability. The stimulus material consisted of short excerpts (6 to 12 s in length) from pop music performances (obtained from MedleyDB; Bittner et al., 2014) for which the vocal track was pitch-shifted relative to the instrumental tracks. In a first experiment, 333 listeners were tested on a two-alternative forced choice task that tested discrimination between a pitch-shifted and an unaltered version of the same audio clip. Explanatory item response modeling was then used to calibrate an adaptive version of the test. A subsequent validation experiment applied this adaptive test to 66 participants with a broad range of musical expertise, producing evidence of the test’s reliability, convergent validity, and divergent validity. The test is ready to be deployed as an experimental tool and should make an important contribution to our understanding of the human ability to judge mistuning.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," pitch perception musical abilities pitch accuracy gold msi mistuning perception test measurement instrument important aspect perceived quality vocal music degree vocalist sings tune listeners sensitive vocal mistuning development perceptual ability differs listeners motivated lack suitable preexisting measures introduce article adaptive ecologically valid test mistuning perception ability stimulus material consisted short excerpts length pop music performances obtained medleydb bittner al vocal track pitch shifted relative instrumental tracks experiment listeners tested alternative forced choice task tested discrimination pitch shifted unaltered version audio clip explanatory item response modeling calibrate adaptive version test subsequent validation experiment applied adaptive test participants broad range musical expertise producing evidence test reliability convergent validity divergent validity test ready deployed experimental tool make important contribution understanding human ability judge mistuning ",0

However, there has been a lack of normed studies describing generalizable principles in gesture production and in comprehension of the mappings of different types of iconic strategies (i.e., modes of representation; Müller, 2013). In Study 1 we elicited silent gestures in order to explore the implementation of different types of iconic representation (i.e., acting, representing, drawing, and personification) to express concepts across five semantic domains. In Study 2 we investigated the degree of meaning transparency (i.e., iconicity ratings) of the gestures elicited in Study 1. We found systematicity in the gestural forms of 109 concepts across all participants, with different types of iconicity aligning with specific semantic domains: Acting was favored for actions and manipulable objects, drawing for nonmanipulable objects, and personification for animate entities. Interpretation of gesture–meaning transparency was modulated by the interaction between mode of representation and semantic domain, with some couplings being more transparent than others: Acting yielded higher ratings for actions, representing for object-related concepts, personification for animate entities, and drawing for nonmanipulable entities. This study provides mapping principles that may extend to all forms of manual communication (gesture and sign). This database includes a list of the most systematic silent gestures in the group of participants, a notation of the form of each gesture based on four features (hand configuration, orientation, placement, and movement), each gesture’s mode of representation, iconicity ratings, and professionally filmed videos that can be used for experimental and clinical endeavors.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes"," iconicity silent gesture modes representation perception iconicity normed database systematic mappings semantic categories types iconic representations manual modality normed database silent gesture unprecedented number empirical studies shown iconic gestures mimic sensorimotor attributes referent contribute significantly language acquisition perception processing lack normed studies describing generalizable principles gesture production comprehension mappings types iconic strategies modes representation ller study elicited silent gestures order explore implementation types iconic representation acting representing drawing personification express concepts semantic domains study investigated degree meaning transparency iconicity ratings gestures elicited study found systematicity gestural forms concepts participants types iconicity aligning specific semantic domains acting favored actions manipulable objects drawing nonmanipulable objects personification animate entities interpretation gesture meaning transparency modulated interaction mode representation semantic domain couplings transparent acting yielded higher ratings actions representing object related concepts personification animate entities drawing nonmanipulable entities study mapping principles extend forms manual communication gesture sign database includes list systematic silent gestures group participants notation form gesture based features hand configuration orientation placement movement gesture mode representation iconicity ratings professionally filmed videos experimental clinical endeavors ",1

A rate-limiting factor in answering such questions is the challenge of recruiting rare DP participants. Although self-reported experiences have long played a role in efforts to identify DPs, much remains unknown about how such self-reports can or should contribute to screening or diagnosis. Here, in a large, population-based web sample, we investigated the effectiveness of self-report, used on its own, as a screen to identify individuals who will ultimately fail, at a conventional cutoff, the two types of objective tests that are most commonly used to confirm DP diagnoses: the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) and the famous faces memory test (FFMT). We used a highly reliable questionnaire (alpha = .91), the Cambridge Face Memory Questionnaire (CFMQ), and revealed strong validity via high correlations of .44 with the CFMT and .52 with the FFMT. However, cutoff analyses revealed that no CFMQ score yielded a clinical-grade combination of sensitivity and positive predictive value in enough individuals to support using it alone as a DP diagnostic or screening tool. This result was replicated in an analysis of data from the widely used PI20 questionnaire, a 20-question self-assessment of facial recognition similar in form to the CFMQ. We therefore recommend that screens for DP should, wherever possible, include objective as well as subjective assessment tools.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," report ability individual differences face recognition screening prosopagnosia meta cognition reported face recognition highly valid highly discriminative prosopagnosia level performance objective assessments severe developmental deficits face recognition ability developmental prosopagnosia dp vigorously studied past decade questions remain unanswered origins nature social consequences rate limiting factor answering questions challenge recruiting rare dp participants reported experiences long played role efforts identify dps remains unknown reports contribute screening diagnosis large population based web sample investigated effectiveness report screen identify individuals ultimately fail conventional cutoff types objective tests commonly confirm dp diagnoses cambridge face memory test cfmt famous faces memory test ffmt highly reliable questionnaire alpha cambridge face memory questionnaire cfmq revealed strong validity high correlations cfmt ffmt cutoff analyses revealed cfmq score yielded clinical grade combination sensitivity positive predictive individuals support dp diagnostic screening tool result replicated analysis data widely pi questionnaire question assessment facial recognition similar form cfmq recommend screens dp include objective subjective assessment tools ",0
"KeywordsStatistical learning Individual differences Reliability Domain generality Children ","do current statistical learning tasks capture stable individual differences in children an investigation of task reliability across modality","Do commonly used statistical-learning tasks capture stable individual differences in children? Infants, children, and adults are capable of using statistical learning (SL) to extract information about their environment. Although most studies have looked at group-level performance, a growing literature examines individual differences in SL and their relation to language-learning outcomes: Individuals who are better at SL are expected to show better linguistic abilities. Accordingly, studies have shown positive correlations between SL performance and language outcomes in both children and adults. However, these studies have often used tasks designed to explore group-level performance without modifying them, resulting in psychometric shortcomings that impact reliability in adults (Siegelman, Bogaerts, Christiansen, & Frost in Transactions of the Royal Society B, 372, 20160059, 2017a; Siegelman, Bogaerts, & Frost in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 418–432, 2017b). Even though similar measures are used to assess individual differences in children, no study to date has examined the reliability of these measures in development. This study examined the reliability of common SL measures in both children and adults. It assessed the reliability of three SL tasks (two auditory and one visual) twice (two months apart) in adults and children (mean age 8 years). Although the tasks showed moderate reliability in adults, they did not capture stable individual variation in children. None of the tasks were reliable across sessions, and all showed internal consistency measures well below psychometric standards. These findings raise significant concerns about the use of current SL measures to predict and explain individual differences in development. The article ends with a discussion of possible explanations for the difference in reliability between children and adults.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," statistical learning individual differences reliability domain generality children current statistical learning tasks capture stable individual differences children investigation task reliability modality commonly statistical learning tasks capture stable individual differences children infants children adults capable statistical learning sl extract information environment studies looked group level performance growing literature examines individual differences sl relation language learning outcomes individuals sl expected show linguistic abilities studies shown positive correlations sl performance language outcomes children adults studies tasks designed explore group level performance modifying resulting psychometric shortcomings impact reliability adults siegelman bogaerts christiansen frost transactions royal society a siegelman bogaerts frost behavior research methods b similar measures assess individual differences children study date examined reliability measures development study examined reliability common sl measures children adults assessed reliability sl tasks auditory visual months adults children age years tasks showed moderate reliability adults capture stable individual variation children tasks reliable sessions showed internal consistency measures psychometric standards findings raise significant concerns current sl measures predict explain individual differences development article ends discussion explanations difference reliability children adults ",0

The performance of this new approach was compared with that of two other approaches: (1) carrying out separate meta-analyses for standardized regression coefficients from studies that used the same regression model, and (2) performing a meta-regression on the focal standardized regression coefficients while including an indicator variable as a moderator indicating the regression model to which each standardized regression coefficient belongs.

"KeywordsQuestions on honest responding Socially desirable responding Sensitive questions Self-reports Internet surveys ","questions on honest responding","This article presents a new method for reducing socially desirable responding in Internet self-reports of desirable and undesirable behavior. The method is based on moving the request for honest responding, often included in the introduction to surveys, to the questioning phase of the survey. Over a quarter of Internet survey participants do not read survey instructions, and therefore, instead of asking respondents to answer honestly, they were asked whether they responded honestly. Posing the honesty message in the form of questions on honest responding draws attention to the message, increases the processing of it, and puts subsequent questions in context with the questions on honest responding. In three studies (nStudy I = 475, nStudy II = 1,015, nStudy III = 899), we tested whether presenting the questions on honest responding before questions on desirable and undesirable behavior could increase the honesty of responses, under the assumption that less attribution of desirable behavior and/or admitting to more undesirable behavior could be taken to indicate more honest responses. In all studies the participants who were presented with the questions on honest responding before questions on the target behavior produced, on average, significantly less socially desirable responses, though the effect sizes were small in all cases (Cohen’s d ranging between 0.02 and 0.28 for single items, and from 0.17 to 0.34 for sum scores).

"KeywordsBody-object interaction Semantic decision task Lexical decision task Motor ratings Visual word recognition ","getting a grip on sensorimotor effects in lexicalsemantic processing","One of the strategies that researchers have used to investigate the role of sensorimotor information in lexical–semantic processing is to examine the effects of words’ rated body–object interaction (BOI; i.e., the ease with which the human body can interact with a word’s referent). Processing tends to be facilitated for words with high as compared with low BOI, across a wide variety of tasks. Such effects have been referenced in debates over the nature of semantic representations, but their theoretical import has been limited by the fact that BOI is a fairly coarse measure of sensorimotor experience with words’ referents. In the present study, we collected ratings for 621 words on seven semantic dimensions (graspability, ease of pantomime, number of actions, animacy, size, danger, and usefulness), in order to investigate which attributes are most strongly related to BOI ratings and to lexical–semantic processing. BOI ratings were obtained from previous norming studies (Bennett, Burnett, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 43, 1100–1109, 2011; Tillotson, Siakaluk, & Pexman in Behavior Research Methods, 40, 1075–1078, 2008), and measures of lexical–semantic processing were obtained from previous behavioral megastudies involving either the semantic categorization task (concrete/abstract decision; Pexman, Heard, Lloyd, & Yap in Behavior Research Methods, 49, 407–417, 2017) or the lexical decision task (Balota et al., Behavior Research Methods, 39, 445–459, 2007). The results showed that the motor dimensions of graspability, ease of pantomime, and number of actions were all related to BOI, and that these dimensions together explained more variance in semantic processing than did the BOI ratings alone. These ratings will be useful for researchers who wish to study how different kinds of bodily interactions influence lexical–semantic processing and cognition.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," body object interaction semantic decision task lexical decision task motor ratings visual word recognition grip sensorimotor effects lexicalsemantic processing strategies researchers investigate role sensorimotor information lexical semantic processing examine effects words rated body object interaction boi ease human body interact word referent processing facilitated words high compared low boi wide variety tasks effects referenced debates nature semantic representations theoretical import limited fact boi fairly coarse measure sensorimotor experience words referents present study collected ratings words semantic dimensions graspability ease pantomime number actions animacy size danger usefulness order investigate attributes strongly related boi ratings lexical semantic processing boi ratings obtained previous norming studies bennett burnett siakaluk pexman behavior research methods tillotson siakaluk pexman behavior research methods measures lexical semantic processing obtained previous behavioral megastudies involving semantic categorization task concrete abstract decision pexman heard lloyd yap behavior research methods lexical decision task balota al behavior research methods results showed motor dimensions graspability ease pantomime number actions related boi dimensions explained variance semantic processing boi ratings ratings researchers study kinds bodily interactions influence lexical semantic processing cognition ",0
"Keywordsᅟ ","the rippling dynamics of valenced messages in naturalistic youth chat","Even though human behavior is largely driven by real-time feedback from others, this social complexity is underrepresented in psychological theory, largely because it is so difficult to isolate. In this work, we performed a quasi-experimental analysis of hundreds of millions of chat room messages between young people. This allowed us to reconstruct how—and on what timeline—the valence of one message affects the valence of subsequent messages by others. For the highly emotionally valenced chat messages that we focused on, we found that these messages elicited a general increase of 0.1 to 0.4 messages per minute. This influence started 2 s after the original message and continued out to 60 s. Expanding our focus to include feedback loops—the way a speaker’s chat comes back to affect him or her—we found that the stimulating effects of these same chat events started rippling back from others 8 s after the original message, to cause an increase in the speaker’s chat that persisted for up to 8 min. This feedback accounted for at least 1% of the bulk of chat. Additionally, a message’s valence affects its dynamics, with negative events feeding back more slowly and continuing to affect the speaker longer. By reconstructing the second-by-second dynamics of many psychosocial processes in aggregate, we captured the timescales at which they collectively ripple through a social system to drive system-level outcomes.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," rippling dynamics valenced messages naturalistic youth chat human behavior largely driven real time feedback social complexity underrepresented psychological theory largely difficult isolate work performed quasi experimental analysis hundreds millions chat room messages young people allowed reconstruct timeline valence message affects valence subsequent messages highly emotionally valenced chat messages focused found messages elicited general increase messages minute influence started original message continued expanding focus include feedback loops speaker chat back affect found stimulating effects chat events started rippling back original message increase speaker chat persisted min feedback accounted bulk chat additionally message valence affects dynamics negative events feeding back slowly continuing affect speaker longer reconstructing dynamics psychosocial processes aggregate captured timescales collectively ripple social system drive system level outcomes ",0
"KeywordsPrototypicality Genre Film Language Computerized text analysis ","genre typical narrative arcs in films are less appealing to lay audiences and professional film critics","People tend to like stimuli—ranging from human faces to text—that are prototypical, and thus easily processed. However, recent research has suggested that less typical stimuli may be preferred in creative contexts, such as fine art or music lyrics. In an archival sample of movie scripts, we tested whether genre-typicality predicted film ratings as a function of rater role (novice audience member or expert film critic). Genre-typicality was operationalized as the profile correlations between linguistic arcs (across five segments, or acts) for each script and within-genre averages. We predicted (1) that critics would prefer more disfluent (genre-atypical) films and general audiences would prefer fluent (genre-typical) films, and (2) that these differences would be most pronounced for genres expected to be more entertaining (e.g., action/adventure) than challenging (e.g., tragedy). Partly consistent with our hypotheses, the results showed that critics gave higher ratings to action/adventure films with less typical positive emotion arcs. However, regardless of audience-member or professional-critic status, higher ratings were attributed to films that were more genre-atypical (or disfluent), in terms of analytic thinking, narrative action, and emotional tone, across all genres except family/kids films. Such findings support the growing literature on the appeal of disfluency in the arts and have relevance for researchers in psychology and computer science who are interested in computational linguistic approaches to attitudes, film, and literature.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," prototypicality genre film language computerized text analysis genre typical narrative arcs films appealing lay audiences professional film critics people tend stimuli ranging human faces text prototypical easily processed recent research suggested typical stimuli preferred creative contexts fine art music lyrics archival sample movie scripts tested genre typicality predicted film ratings function rater role novice audience member expert film critic genre typicality operationalized profile correlations linguistic arcs segments acts script genre averages predicted critics prefer disfluent genre atypical films general audiences prefer fluent genre typical films differences pronounced genres expected entertaining action adventure challenging tragedy partly consistent hypotheses results showed critics gave higher ratings action adventure films typical positive emotion arcs audience member professional critic status higher ratings attributed films genre atypical disfluent terms analytic thinking narrative action emotional tone genres family kids films findings support growing literature appeal disfluency arts relevance researchers psychology computer science interested computational linguistic approaches attitudes film literature ",0

"KeywordsPupillometry Executive functioning Arousal Cognitive load Psychophysics ","the human task evoked pupillary response function is linear implications for baseline response scaling in pupillometry","The human task-evoked pupillary response provides a sensitive physiological index of the intensity and online resource demands of numerous cognitive processes (e.g., memory retrieval, problem solving, or target detection). Cognitive pupillometry is a well-established technique that relies upon precise measurement of these subtle response functions. Baseline variability of pupil diameter is a complex artifact that typically necessitates mathematical correction. A methodological paradox within pupillometry is that linear and nonlinear forms of baseline scaling both remain accepted baseline correction techniques, despite yielding highly disparate results. The task-evoked pupillary response (TEPR) could potentially scale nonlinearly, similar to autonomic functions such as heart rate, in which the amplitude of an evoked response diminishes as the baseline rises. Alternatively, the TEPR could scale similarly to the cortical hemodynamic response, as a linear function that is independent of its baseline. However, the TEPR cannot scale both linearly and nonlinearly. Our aim was to adjudicate between linear and nonlinear scaling of human TEPR. We manipulated baseline pupil size by modulating the illuminance in the testing room as participants heard abrupt pure-tone transitions (Exp. 1) or visually monitored word lists (Exp. 2). Phasic pupillary responses scaled according to a linear function across all lighting (dark, mid, bright) and task (tones, words) conditions, demonstrating that the TEPR is independent of its baseline amplitude.

"KeywordsNavigation Route learning Navigation test Cognitive aging ","a novel virtual reality based route learning test suite assessing the effects of cognitive aging on navigation","Most research groups studying human navigational behavior with virtual environment (VE) technology develop their own tasks and protocols. This makes it difficult to compare results between groups and to create normative data sets for any specific navigational task. Such norms, however, are prerequisites for the use of navigation assessments as diagnostic tools—for example, to support the early and differential diagnosis of atypical aging. Here we start addressing these problems by presenting and evaluating a new navigation test suite that we make freely available to other researchers (https://osf.io/mx52y/). Specifically, we designed three navigational tasks, which are adaptations of earlier published tasks used to study the effects of typical and atypical aging on navigation: a route-repetition task that can be solved using egocentric navigation strategies, and route-retracing and directional-approach tasks that both require allocentric spatial processing. Despite introducing a number of changes to the original tasks to make them look more realistic and ecologically valid, and therefore easy to explain to people unfamiliar with a VE or who have cognitive impairments, we replicated the findings from the original studies. Specifically, we found general age-related declines in navigation performance and additional specific difficulties in tasks that required allocentric processes. These findings demonstrate that our new tasks have task demands similar to those of the original tasks, and are thus suited to be used more widely.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," navigation route learning navigation test cognitive aging virtual reality based route learning test suite assessing effects cognitive aging navigation research groups studying human navigational behavior virtual environment ve technology develop tasks protocols makes difficult compare results groups create normative data sets specific navigational task norms prerequisites navigation assessments diagnostic tools support early differential diagnosis atypical aging start addressing problems presenting evaluating navigation test suite make freely researchers https osf io mx y specifically designed navigational tasks adaptations earlier published tasks study effects typical atypical aging navigation route repetition task solved egocentric navigation strategies route retracing directional approach tasks require allocentric spatial processing introducing number original tasks make realistic ecologically valid easy explain people unfamiliar ve cognitive impairments replicated findings original studies specifically found general age related declines navigation performance additional specific difficulties tasks required allocentric processes findings demonstrate tasks task demands similar original tasks suited widely ",0
"KeywordsEye tracking Nystagmus Calibration ","a robust method for calibration of eye tracking data recorded during nystagmus","Eye tracking is a useful tool when studying the oscillatory eye movements associated with nystagmus. However, this oscillatory nature of nystagmus is problematic during calibration since it introduces uncertainty about where the person is actually looking. This renders comparisons between separate recordings unreliable. Still, the influence of the calibration protocol on eye movement data from people with nystagmus has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we propose a calibration method using Procrustes analysis in combination with an outlier correction algorithm, which is based on a model of the calibration data and on the geometry of the experimental setup. The proposed method is compared to previously used calibration polynomials in terms of accuracy, calibration plane distortion and waveform robustness. Six recordings of calibration data, validation data and optokinetic nystagmus data from people with nystagmus and seven recordings from a control group were included in the study. Fixation errors during the recording of calibration data from the healthy participants were introduced, simulating fixation errors caused by the oscillatory movements found in nystagmus data. The outlier correction algorithm improved the accuracy for all tested calibration methods. The accuracy and calibration plane distortion performance of the Procrustes analysis calibration method were similar to the top performing mapping functions for the simulated fixation errors. The performance in terms of waveform robustness was superior for the Procrustes analysis calibration compared to the other calibration methods. The overall performance of the Procrustes calibration methods was best for the datasets containing errors during the calibration.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," eye tracking nystagmus calibration robust method calibration eye tracking data recorded nystagmus eye tracking tool studying oscillatory eye movements nystagmus oscillatory nature nystagmus problematic calibration introduces uncertainty person renders comparisons separate recordings unreliable influence calibration protocol eye movement data people nystagmus investigated work propose calibration method procrustes analysis combination outlier correction algorithm based model calibration data geometry experimental setup proposed method compared previously calibration polynomials terms accuracy calibration plane distortion waveform robustness recordings calibration data validation data optokinetic nystagmus data people nystagmus recordings control group included study fixation errors recording calibration data healthy participants introduced simulating fixation errors caused oscillatory movements found nystagmus data outlier correction algorithm improved accuracy tested calibration methods accuracy calibration plane distortion performance procrustes analysis calibration method similar top performing mapping functions simulated fixation errors performance terms waveform robustness superior procrustes analysis calibration compared calibration methods performance procrustes calibration methods datasets errors calibration ",0
"KeywordsNonlinear mixed-effects location scale model Verbal learning Intra-individual variability Bayesian inference ","a bayesian nonlinear mixed effects location scale model for learning","We present a Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects location scale model (NL-MELSM). The NL-MELSM allows for fitting nonlinear functions to the location, or individual means, and the scale, or within-person variance. Specifically, in the context of learning, this model allows the within-person variance to follow a nonlinear trajectory, where it can be determined whether variability reduces during learning. It incorporates a sub-model that can predict nonlinear parameters for both the location and scale. This specification estimates random effects for all nonlinear location and scale parameters that are drawn from a common multivariate distribution. This allows estimation of covariances among the random effects, within and across the location and the scale. These covariances offer new insights into the interplay between individual mean structures and intra-individual variability in nonlinear parameters. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only for ease of estimation but also for inference because it provides the necessary and consistent information for use in psychological applications, such as model selection and hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model, we use data from 333 individuals, consisting of three age groups, who participated in five learning trials that assessed verbal memory. In an exploratory context, we demonstrate that fitting a nonlinear function to the within-person variance, and allowing for individual variation therein, improves predictive accuracy compared to customary modeling techniques (e.g., assuming constant variance). We conclude by discussing the usefulness, limitations, and future directions of the NL-MELSM.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," nonlinear mixed effects location scale model verbal learning intra individual variability bayesian inference bayesian nonlinear mixed effects location scale model learning present bayesian nonlinear mixed effects location scale model nl melsm nl melsm fitting nonlinear functions location individual means scale person variance specifically context learning model person variance follow nonlinear trajectory determined variability reduces learning incorporates model predict nonlinear parameters location scale specification estimates random effects nonlinear location scale parameters drawn common multivariate distribution estimation covariances random effects location scale covariances offer insights interplay individual structures intra individual variability nonlinear parameters fully bayesian approach ease estimation inference consistent information psychological applications model selection hypothesis testing illustrate model data individuals consisting age groups participated learning trials assessed verbal memory exploratory context demonstrate fitting nonlinear function person variance allowing individual variation improves predictive accuracy compared customary modeling techniques assuming constant variance conclude discussing usefulness limitations future directions nl melsm ",0

Indeed, even if paying one respondent to complete one questionnaire represents a very small cost, the multiplication of botnets providing invalid response sets may ultimately reduce study validity while increasing research costs. Several techniques have been proposed thus far to detect problematic human response sets, but little research has been undertaken to test the extent to which they actually detect nonhuman response sets. Thus, we proposed to conduct an empirical comparison of these indices. Assuming that most botnet programs are based on random uniform distributions of responses, we present and compare seven indices in this study to detect nonhuman response sets. A sample of 1,967 human respondents was mixed with different percentages (i.e., from 5% to 50%) of simulated random response sets. Three of the seven indices (i.e., response coherence, Mahalanobis distance, and person–total correlation) appear to be the best estimators for detecting nonhuman response sets.

"KeywordsDecision-making Evidence accumulation models Random number generation Probability density approximation ","a method framework and tutorial for efficiently simulating models of decision making","Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) have become the dominant models of rapid decision-making. Several variants of these models have been proposed, ranging from the simple linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) to the more complex leaky-competing accumulator (LCA), and further extensions that include time-varying rates of evidence accumulation or decision thresholds. Although applications of the simpler variants have been widespread, applications of the more complex models have been fewer, largely due to their intractable likelihood function and the computational cost of mass simulation. Here, I present a framework for efficiently fitting complex EAMs, which uses a new, efficient method of simulating these models. I find that the majority of simulation time is taken up by random number generation (RNG) from the normal distribution, needed for the stochastic noise of the differential equation. To reduce this inefficiency, I propose using the well-known concept within computer science of “look-up tables” (LUTs) as an approximation to the inverse cumulative density function (iCDF) method of RNG, which I call “LUT-iCDF”. I show that when using an appropriately sized LUT, simulations using LUT-iCDF closely match those from the standard RNG method in R. My framework, which I provide a detailed tutorial on how to implement, includes C code for 12 different variants of EAMs using the LUT-iCDF method, and should make the implementation of complex EAMs easier and faster.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," decision making evidence accumulation models random number generation probability density approximation method framework tutorial efficiently simulating models decision making evidence accumulation models eams dominant models rapid decision making variants models proposed ranging simple linear ballistic accumulator lba complex leaky competing accumulator lca extensions include time varying rates evidence accumulation decision thresholds applications simpler variants widespread applications complex models fewer largely due intractable likelihood function computational cost mass simulation present framework efficiently fitting complex eams efficient method simulating models find majority simulation time random number generation rng normal distribution needed stochastic noise differential equation reduce inefficiency propose concept computer science tables luts approximation inverse cumulative density function icdf method rng call lut icdf show appropriately sized lut simulations lut icdf closely match standard rng method framework provide detailed tutorial implement includes code variants eams lut icdf method make implementation complex eams easier faster ",0
"KeywordsEye movements Event detection Deep learning Fixation Saccade PSO ","gazenet end to end eye movement event detection with deep neural networks","Existing event detection algorithms for eye-movement data almost exclusively rely on thresholding one or more hand-crafted signal features, each computed from the stream of raw gaze data. Moreover, this thresholding is largely left for the end user. Here we present and develop gazeNet, a new framework for creating event detectors that do not require hand-crafted signal features or signal thresholding. It employs an end-to-end deep learning approach, which takes raw eye-tracking data as input and classifies it into fixations, saccades and post-saccadic oscillations. Our method thereby challenges an established tacit assumption that hand-crafted features are necessary in the design of event detection algorithms. The downside of the deep learning approach is that a large amount of training data is required. We therefore first develop a method to augment hand-coded data, so that we can strongly enlarge the data set used for training, minimizing the time spent on manual coding. Using this extended hand-coded data, we train a neural network that produces eye-movement event classification from raw eye-movement data without requiring any predefined feature extraction or post-processing steps. The resulting classification performance is at the level of expert human coders. Moreover, an evaluation of gazeNet on two other datasets showed that gazeNet generalized to data from different eye trackers and consistently outperformed several other event detection algorithms that we tested.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," eye movements event detection deep learning fixation saccade pso gazenet end end eye movement event detection deep neural networks existing event detection algorithms eye movement data exclusively rely thresholding hand crafted signal features computed stream raw gaze data thresholding largely left end user present develop gazenet framework creating event detectors require hand crafted signal features signal thresholding employs end end deep learning approach takes raw eye tracking data input classifies fixations saccades post saccadic oscillations method challenges established tacit assumption hand crafted features design event detection algorithms downside deep learning approach large amount training data required develop method augment hand coded data strongly enlarge data set training minimizing time spent manual coding extended hand coded data train neural network produces eye movement event classification raw eye movement data requiring predefined feature extraction post processing steps resulting classification performance level expert human coders evaluation gazenet datasets showed gazenet generalized data eye trackers consistently outperformed event detection algorithms tested ",0
"KeywordsGroup communication analysis Social roles Group interaction Computational linguistics ","group communication analysis a computational linguistics approach for detecting sociocognitive roles in multiparty interactions","Roles are one of the most important concepts in understanding human sociocognitive behavior. During group interactions, members take on different roles within the discussion. Roles have distinct patterns of behavioral engagement (i.e., active or passive, leading or following), contribution characteristics (i.e., providing new information or echoing given material), and social orientation (i.e., individual or group). Different combinations of roles can produce characteristically different group outcomes, and thus can be either less or more productive with regard to collective goals. In online collaborative-learning environments, this can lead to better or worse learning outcomes for the individual participants. In this study, we propose and validate a novel approach for detecting emergent roles from participants’ contributions and patterns of interaction. Specifically, we developed a group communication analysis (GCA) by combining automated computational linguistic techniques with analyses of the sequential interactions of online group communication. GCA was applied to three large collaborative interaction datasets (participant N = 2,429, group N = 3,598). Cluster analyses and linear mixed-effects modeling were used to assess the validity of the GCA approach and the influence of learner roles on student and group performance. The results indicated that participants’ patterns of linguistic coordination and cohesion are representative of the roles that individuals play in collaborative discussions. More broadly, GCA provides a framework for researchers to explore the micro intra- and interpersonal patterns associated with participants’ roles and the sociocognitive processes related to successful collaboration.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," group communication analysis social roles group interaction computational linguistics group communication analysis computational linguistics approach detecting sociocognitive roles multiparty interactions roles important concepts understanding human sociocognitive behavior group interactions members roles discussion roles distinct patterns behavioral engagement active passive leading contribution characteristics providing information echoing material social orientation individual group combinations roles produce characteristically group outcomes productive regard collective goals online collaborative learning environments lead worse learning outcomes individual participants study propose validate approach detecting emergent roles participants contributions patterns interaction specifically developed group communication analysis gca combining automated computational linguistic techniques analyses sequential interactions online group communication gca applied large collaborative interaction datasets participant group cluster analyses linear mixed effects modeling assess validity gca approach influence learner roles student group performance results participants patterns linguistic coordination cohesion representative roles individuals play collaborative discussions broadly gca framework researchers explore micro intra interpersonal patterns participants roles sociocognitive processes related successful collaboration ",0

We created a tool that is open source, enables reproducible results, and encourages cumulative science in this domain. WordSeg has a modular architecture: It combines a set of corpora description routines, multiple algorithms varying in complexity and cognitive assumptions (including several that were not publicly available, or insufficiently documented), and a rich evaluation package. In the paper, we illustrate the use of this package by analyzing a corpus of child-directed speech in various ways, which further allows us to make recommendations for experimental design of follow-up work. Supplementary materials allow readers to reproduce every result in this paper, and detailed online instructions further enable them to go beyond what we have done. Moreover, the system can be installed within container software that ensures a stable and reliable environment. Finally, by virtue of its modular architecture and transparency, WordSeg can work as an open-source platform, to which other researchers can add their own segmentation algorithms.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"Yes"," unsupervised word discovery language acquisition natural language processing cumulative science wordseg standardizing unsupervised word form segmentation text basic task language acquisition involves discovering boundaries words morphemes input basic units overtly segmented number unsupervised learning algorithms proposed years purposes implemented computationally results remain difficult compare papers created tool open source enables reproducible results encourages cumulative science domain wordseg modular architecture combines set corpora description routines multiple algorithms varying complexity cognitive assumptions including publicly insufficiently documented rich evaluation package paper illustrate package analyzing corpus child directed speech ways make recommendations experimental design follow work supplementary materials readers reproduce result paper detailed online instructions enable system installed container software ensures stable reliable environment finally virtue modular architecture transparency wordseg work open source platform researchers add segmentation algorithms ",1

In the present study, we aimed to build on this work and demonstrate that there is a large and systematic bias in the use of personal names in the natural-language environment, such that male names are much more prevalent than female names. This bias holds over an analysis of billions of words of text, subcategorized into different genres within fiction novels, nonfiction books, and subtitles from television and film. Additionally, we showed that this bias holds across time, with more recent work displaying the same patterns as work published tens or hundreds of years previously. Finally, we showed that the main cause of the bias comes from male authors perpetuating the bias toward male names, with female authors showing a much smaller bias.

However, performing a qualitative analysis across a massive social media data set is cumbersome and impractical. Instead, researchers often extract a subset of content to analyze, but a framework to facilitate this process is currently lacking. We present a four-phased framework for improving this extraction process, which blends the capacities of data science techniques to compress large data sets into smaller spaces, with the capabilities of qualitative analysis to address research questions.

Although the lab provides excellent facilities for controlled testing, some questions are best explored by collecting information that is difficult to obtain in the lab. The vast amounts of data now available to researchers can be a valuable resource in this respect. By incorporating this new realm of data and translating it into traditional laboratory methods, we can expand the reach of the lab into the wilderness of human society. This study demonstrates how the troves of linguistic data generated by humans can be used to test theories about cognition and representation. It also suggests how similar interpretations can be made of other research in cognition. The first case tests a long-standing prediction of Gentner’s natural partition hypothesis: that verb meaning is more subject to change due to the textual context in which it appears than is the meaning of nouns. Within a diachronic corpus, verbs and other relational words indeed showed more evidence of semantic change than did concrete nouns. In the second case, corpus statistics were employed to empirically support the existence of phonesthemes—nonmorphemic units of sound that are associated with aspects of meaning. A third study also supported this measure, by demonstrating that it corresponds with performance in a lab experiment. Neither of these questions can be adequately explored without the use of big data in the form of linguistic corpora.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," corpus statistics big data semantic change representation phonesthemes taming big data applying experimental method naturalistic data sets psychological researchers traditionally focused lab based experiments test theories hypotheses lab excellent facilities controlled testing questions explored collecting information difficult obtain lab vast amounts data researchers valuable resource respect incorporating realm data translating traditional laboratory methods expand reach lab wilderness human society study demonstrates troves linguistic data generated humans test theories cognition representation suggests similar interpretations made research cognition case tests long standing prediction gentner natural partition hypothesis verb meaning subject change due textual context appears meaning nouns diachronic corpus verbs relational words showed evidence semantic change concrete nouns case corpus statistics employed empirically support existence phonesthemes nonmorphemic units sound aspects meaning study supported measure demonstrating corresponds performance lab experiment questions adequately explored big data form linguistic corpora ",0

"KeywordsConceptual recurrence analysis Text analysis Semantic similarity Semantic coordination Team communication Interpersonal communication ","beyond frequency counts novel conceptual recurrence analysis metrics to index semantic coordination in team communications","Semantic alignment is a key process underlying interpersonal and team communication. However, semantic similarity is difficult to quantify, and statistical approaches designed to measure it often rely on methods that make the identification of the relative importance of key words difficult. This study outlines how conceptual recurrence analysis (CRA) can address these issues and can be used to detect conceptual structure in interpersonal communication. We developed several novel CRA metrics to analyze communication data reported previously by Mancuso, Finomore, Rahill, Blair, and Funke (Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 58, 405–409, 2014), gathered from teams who worked cooperatively on a logic puzzle under different cognitive biasing contexts. CRA, like other measures of semantic coordination, relies on parameters whose values affect estimates of semantic alignment. We evaluated how the dimensionality of semantic spaces affects metrics quantifying the conceptual similarity of communicative exchanges, and whether metrics calculated from top-down, a priori semantic spaces or bottom-up semantic spaces empirically derived from each data set were more sensitive to biasing context. We found that the novel CRA measures were sensitive to manipulations of cognitive bias, and that higher-dimensional, bottom-up semantic spaces generally yielded more sensitivity to the experimental manipulations, though when the communication was evaluated with respect to specific key concepts, lower-dimensional, top-down spaces performed nearly as well. We conclude that CRA is sensitive to experimental manipulations in ways consistent with prior findings and that it presents a customizable framework for testing predictions about interpersonal communication patterns and other linguistic exchanges.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," conceptual recurrence analysis text analysis semantic similarity semantic coordination team communication interpersonal communication frequency counts conceptual recurrence analysis metrics index semantic coordination team communications semantic alignment key process underlying interpersonal team communication semantic similarity difficult quantify statistical approaches designed measure rely methods make identification relative importance key words difficult study outlines conceptual recurrence analysis cra address issues detect conceptual structure interpersonal communication developed cra metrics analyze communication data reported previously mancuso finomore rahill blair funke proceedings human factors ergonomics society annual meeting gathered teams worked cooperatively logic puzzle cognitive biasing contexts cra measures semantic coordination relies parameters values affect estimates semantic alignment evaluated dimensionality semantic spaces affects metrics quantifying conceptual similarity communicative exchanges metrics calculated top priori semantic spaces bottom semantic spaces empirically derived data set sensitive biasing context found cra measures sensitive manipulations cognitive bias higher dimensional bottom semantic spaces generally yielded sensitivity experimental manipulations communication evaluated respect specific key concepts lower dimensional top spaces performed conclude cra sensitive experimental manipulations ways consistent prior findings presents customizable framework testing predictions interpersonal communication patterns linguistic exchanges ",0
"KeywordsMethodological innovation Text analysis Continuous representations Intent recognition ","measuring the importance of context when modeling language comprehension","It is widely accepted that language requires context in order to function as communication between speakers and listeners. As listeners, we make use of background knowledge — about the speaker, about entities and concepts, about previous utterances — in order to infer the speaker’s intended meaning. But even if there is consensus that these sources of information are a necessary component of linguistic communication, it is another matter entirely to provide a thorough, quantitative accounting for context’s interaction with language. When does context matter? What kinds of context matter in which kinds of domains? The empirical investigation of these questions is inhibited by a number of factors: the challenge of quantifying language, the boundless combinations of domains and types of context to be measured, and the challenge of selecting and applying a given construct to natural language data. In response to these factors, we introduce and demonstrate a methodological framework for testing the importance of contextual information in inferring speaker intentions from text. We apply Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks, a standard for representing language in its natural, sequential state, and conduct a set of experiments for predicting the persuasive intentions of speakers in political debates using different combinations of text and background information about the speaker.

"KeywordsConceptual knowledge Conceptual flexibility Network science ","implementing a concept network model","The same concept can mean different things or be instantiated in different forms, depending on context, suggesting a degree of flexibility within the conceptual system. We propose that a feature-based network model can be used to capture and predict this flexibility. We modeled individual concepts (e.g., banana, bottle) as graph-theoretical networks, in which properties (e.g., yellow, sweet) were represented as nodes and their associations as edges. In this framework, networks capture within-concept statistics that reflect how properties relate to one another across instances of a concept. We extracted formal measures of these networks that capture different aspects of network structure, and explored whether a concept’s network structure relates to its flexibility of use. To do so, we compared network measures to a text-based measure of semantic diversity, as well as to empirical data from a figurative-language task and an alternative-uses task. We found that network-based measures were predictive of the text-based and empirical measures of flexible concept use, highlighting the ability of this approach to formally capture relevant characteristics of conceptual structure. Conceptual flexibility is a fundamental attribute of the cognitive and semantic systems, and in this proof of concept we reveal that variations in concept representation and use can be formally understood in terms of the informational content and topology of concept networks.","Behavior Research Methods",2019,"No"," conceptual knowledge conceptual flexibility network science implementing concept network model concept things instantiated forms depending context suggesting degree flexibility conceptual system propose feature based network model capture predict flexibility modeled individual concepts banana bottle graph theoretical networks properties yellow sweet represented nodes associations edges framework networks capture concept statistics reflect properties relate instances concept extracted formal measures networks capture aspects network structure explored concept network structure relates flexibility compared network measures text based measure semantic diversity empirical data figurative language task alternative task found network based measures predictive text based empirical measures flexible concept highlighting ability approach formally capture relevant characteristics conceptual structure conceptual flexibility fundamental attribute cognitive semantic systems proof concept reveal variations concept representation formally understood terms informational content topology concept networks ",0

Language samples were collected from the social media website Reddit, drawing on posts to discussion groups focusing on different kinds of mental illness (clinical subreddits), as well as on posts to discussion groups focusing on nonmental health topics (nonclinical subreddits). As expected, words drawn from the clinical subreddits could be used to distinguish several kinds of mental illness (ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression). Interestingly, words drawn from the nonclinical subreddits (e.g., travel, cooking, cars) could also be used to distinguish different categories of mental illness, implying that the impact of mental illness spills over into topics unrelated to mental illness. Most importantly, words derived from the nonclinical subreddits predicted future postings to clinical subreddits, implying that everyday language contains signal about the likelihood of future mental illness, possibly before people are aware of their mental health condition. Finally, whereas models trained on clinical subreddits learned to focus on words indicating disorder-specific symptoms, models trained to predict future mental illness learned to focus on words indicating life stress, suggesting that kinds of features that are predictive of mental illness may change over time.

"KeywordsMeasurement of facial movement Emotion expression Optical measurement Video data analysis Open-source software ","the blenderface method video based measurement of raw movement data during facial expressions of emotion using open source software","This article proposes an optical measurement of movement applied to data from video recordings of facial expressions of emotion. The approach offers a way to capture motion adapted from the film industry in which markers placed on the skin of the face can be tracked with a pattern-matching algorithm. The method records and postprocesses raw facial movement data (coordinates per frame) of distinctly placed markers and is intended for use in facial expression research (e.g., microexpressions) in laboratory settings. Due to the explicit use of specifically placed, artificial markers, the procedure offers the simultaneous measurement of several emotionally relevant markers in a (psychometrically) objective and artifact-free way, even for facial regions without natural landmarks (e.g., the cheeks). In addition, the proposed procedure is fully based on open-source software and is transparent at every step of data processing. Two worked examples demonstrate the practicability of the proposed procedure: In Study 1(N= 39), the participants were instructed to show the emotions happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger, and in Study 2 (N= 113), they were asked to present both a neutral face and the emotions happiness, disgust, and fear. Study 2 involved the simultaneous tracking of 14 markers for approximately 12 min per participant with a time resolution of 33 ms. The measured facial movements corresponded closely to the assumptions of established measurement instruments (EMFACS, FACSAID, Friesen & Ekman, 1983; Ekman & Hager, 2002).

We explored this question within the context of e-mail communications and investigated the variables that influence recall for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails. We designed a Web-based program that analyzed each participant’s year-old sent e-mail archive and applied textual analysis algorithms to identify a set of sentences likely to be memorable. These sentences were then used as the stimuli in a cued recall task. Participants saw two sentences from their sent e-mail as a cue and attempted to recall the name of the e-mail recipient. Participants also rated the vividness of recall for the e-mail conversation and estimated the month in which they had written the e-mail. Linear mixed-effect analyses revealed that recipient name recall accuracy decreased with longer retention intervals and increased with greater frequency of contact with the recipient. Also, with longer retention intervals, participants dated e-mails as being more recent than their actual month. This telescoping error was moderately larger for e-mails with greater sentiment. These findings suggest that memory for personally familiar names and temporal information in e-mails closely follows the patterns for autobiographical memory and proper-name recall found in laboratory settings.

We reviewed research comparing eye movements during self-categorized episodes of normal versus mindless reading and found little consensus regarding the specific measures that are sensitive to attentional decoupling during mind wandering. To address this issue of inconsistency, we conducted a new, high-powered eye-tracking experiment and considered all previously identified mind-wandering indicators. In our experiment, only three measures (reading time, fixation count, and first-fixation duration) positively predicted self-categorized mindless reading. Aside from these single measures, the word-frequency effect was found to be generally less pronounced during mindless-reading than during normal-reading episodes. To additionally test for convergent validity between the objective and subjective mind-wandering measures, we utilized eye-movement measures as well as thought reports, to examine the effect of metacognitive awareness on mind-wandering behavior. We expected that participants anticipating a difficult comprehension test would mind wander less during reading than would those anticipating an easy test.

Soundgen (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=soundgen) is an open-source R package that synthesizes nonverbal vocalizations based on meaningful acoustic parameters, which can be specified from the command line or in an interactive app. This tool was validated by comparing the perceived emotion, valence, arousal, and authenticity of 60 recorded human nonverbal vocalizations (screams, moans, laughs, and so on) and their approximate synthetic reproductions. Each synthetic sound was created by manually specifying only a small number of high-level control parameters, such as syllable length and a few anchors for the intonation contour. Nevertheless, the valence and arousal ratings of synthetic sounds were similar to those of the original recordings, and the authenticity ratings were comparable, maintaining parity with the originals for less complex vocalizations. Manipulating the precise acoustic characteristics of synthetic sounds may shed light on the salient predictors of emotion in the human voice.
