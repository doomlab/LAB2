Abstract = {The cross-linguistic evidence presented in this special issue may be unprecedented in bringing together data from a substantial number of young children exposed to diverse language pairs and bilingual backgrounds. Attempts at controlling methodological variability add to the value of the findings. Collectively, the results reported here may contribute to a better theoretical understanding of the universal mechanisms involved in bilingual language acquisition. The present findings also have important implications for clinical practice as they shed light on the expressive vocabulary abilities that may be expected of typically developing children having different bilingual backgrounds and the risk or protective effect of environmental factors. Clinicians should therefore be better equipped at distinguishing clinically significant language delays from natural consequences of bilingual exposure in specific contexts. Finally, this research endeavour hopes to pave the way for further investigations of the vocabulary skills of children raised in other bilingual, or even multilingual, settings. By following the same methodological design, researchers would support the expansion of the current cross-linguistic database and add to its theoretical and clinical value.

Abstract = {SLIM is a prototype interactive multimedia self-learning linguistic software for foreign language students at beginner-false beginner level. It allows students to work both in an autonomous self-directed mode or in a way of programmed learning in which the process of self-instruction is pre-programmed and monitored. In this latter mode it incorporates assessment and evaluation tools in order to behave as an automatic tutor. It is organized into three basic components: audiovisual materials; a linguistic database recording all language material in text format; the supervisor. Audiovisual materials are partially taken from commercially available courses; the linguistic database is a highly sophisticated classification of all words and utterances of the course, both in written and spoken form, from all possible linguistic aspects. The supervisor is both an attractive, enjoyable and strongly pedagogically based software that allows the user to work on language materials. The most outstanding feature of SLIM is the use of speech analysis and recognition which is a fundamental aspect of all second language learning programmes. We also assume that a learning model can be represented by a finite state automaton made up by a fixed number of possible states - corresponding to the macro and microlevels at which the student's competence may be modelled - each one being internally constituted by the actual linguistic objects of knowledge of the language that make it up.

Abstract = {Parent report has proven a valid and cost-effective means of evaluating early child language. Norming datasets for these instruments, which provide the basis for standardized comparisons of individual children to a population, can also be used to derive norms for the acquisition of individual words in production and comprehension and also early gestures and symbolic actions. These lexical norms have a wide range of uses in basic research, assessment and intervention. In addition, cross-linguistic comparisons of lexical development are greatly facilitated by the availability of norms from diverse languages. This report describes the development of CLEX, a new web-based cross-linguistic database for lexical data from adaptations of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories. CLEX provides tools for a range of analyses within and across languages. It is designed to incorporate additional language datasets easily, and to permit users to define mappings between lexical items in pairs of languages for more specific cross-linguistic comparisons.

Abstract = {It is well known that secondary articulation types, such as labialization and palatalization, as well as laryngeal modifications, such as aspiration and glottalization, can play a contrastive role in segment inventories. This article describes an investigation of such segmental modifications, whether laryngeal, supralaryngeal or nasal, on the basis of detailed analyses of each of the 317 languages in the cross-linguistic database presented in Maddieson (1984). In the first part of this investigation, the hypothesis is tested that segmental modifications occur on natural classes of consonants rather than randomly or on isolated segments. A formalism is proposed to express this regularity. Recent theoretical proposals concerning the representation of complex segments, in particular affricates, lead to predictions regarding the patterning of segmental modification on such segments; in the second part of our investigation, these predictions are tested against the cross-linguistic data on segmental modification on affricates in the same sample of languages.

Abstract = {The present research investigated Internet search engines as a rapid, cost-effective alternative for estimating word frequencies. Frequency estimates for 382 words were obtained and compared across four methods: Internet search engines, the Kucera and Francis (1967) analysis of a traditional linguistic corpus, the CELEX English linguistic database, and participant ratings of familiarity. The results showed that Internet search engines produced frequency estimates that were highly consistent with those reported by Kucera and Francis and those calculated from CELEX, highly consistent across search engines, and very reliable over a 6-month period of time. Additional results suggested that Internet search engines are an excellent option when traditional word frequency analyses do not contain the necessary data (e.g., estimates for forenames and slang). In contrast, participants' familiarity judgments did not correspond well with the more objective estimates of word frequency. Researchers are advised to use search engines with large databases to ensure the greatest representativeness of the frequency estimates.

Abstract = {In this article we introduce childLex, an online database for children’s print language in German. childLex is based on a large corpus of children’s books and textbooks used in school that comprises ca. 8 million words. It includes linguistic norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level. Such norms are urgently needed in psychological research for the design of age-adequate stimulus and training materials. Separate norms are available for three age groups: 6–8 years (1st and 2nd grade), 9–10 years (3rd and 4th grade), and 11–12 years (5th and 6th grade). Moreover, childLex is directly comparable to the DWDS corpus, a large corpus for adults’ print language. Here, we describe how childLex was collected and analyzed and compare frequency norms on the lexical, super-lexical, and sub-lexical level with frequency norms obtained from the DWDS corpus. Results show moderate levels of correspondence in the high-frequency range and on the sub-lexical level, but strong discrepancies for medium- and low-frequency elements on the lexical and super-lexical level. Finally, we illustrate which variables are available in childLex and how they can be retrieved using a web interface. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
